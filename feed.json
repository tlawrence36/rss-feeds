      "\u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d have debuted in theaters with a combined $270 million in ticket sales",
      "NEW YORK -- With a combined $270 million in worldwide ticket sales, \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d breathed fresh life into a box office that has struggled lately, leading to one of the busiest moviegoing weekends of the year.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish big-budget musical \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, debuted with $114 million domestically and $164.2 million globally for Universal Pictures, according to studio estimates Sunday. That made it the third-biggest opening weekend of the year, behind only \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d It\u2019s also a record for a Broadway musical adaptation.",
      "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d a sequel to his 2000 best picture-winning original, launched with $55.5 million in ticket sales. With a price tag of around $250 million to produce it, \u201cGladiator II\u201d was a big bet by Paramount Pictures to return to the Coliseum with a largely new cast, led by Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal. While it opened with a touch less than the $60 million predicted in domestic ticket sales, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has performed well overseas. It added $50.5 million internationally.",
      "The collision of the two movies led to some echoes of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d effect of last year, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d launched simultaneously. The nickname this time, \u201cGlicked,\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as catchy and the cultural imprint was also notably less. Few people sought out a double feature this time. The domestic grosses in 2023 \u2013 $162 million for \u201cBarbie\u201d and $82 million for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013 were also higher.",
      "For Universal, which distributed \u201cOppenheimer\" last year, the weekend was more a triumph of \u201cWicked\" than it was of \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw an opportunity to dominate a weekend and get a very large running start into the Thanksgiving holiday,\" said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \"We're very confident that it will play ridiculously well through the Christmas corridor and into the new year.\u201d",
      "But the counter-programming effect was still potent for \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which likewise split broadly along gender lines. And it was again the female-leaning release \u2013 \u201cWicked,\u201d like \u201cBarbie\u201d before it \u2013 that easily won the weekend. About 72% of ticket buyers for \u201cWicked\u201d were female, while 61% of those seeing \u201cGladiator II\u201d were male.",
      "\u201cStanding on their own, each of these movies may have done pretty much what they did, but it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cRaising awareness can indeed lead to an increase in box office. Let\u2019s put it this way: They didn\u2019t hurt each other at all.\u201d",
      "While \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d benefitted enormously from meme-spread word-of-mouth, both \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d leaned on all-out marketing blitzes.",
      "The \u201cGladiator II\u201d campaign featured everything from a much-debated Airbnb cross-promotion with the actual Colosseum in Rome to simultaneously running a one-minute trailer on more than 4,000 TV networks, radio station and digital platforms.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d onslaught went even further, with pink and green themed \u201cWickedly Delicious\u201d Starbucks drinks, Stanley mugs and Mattel dolls (some of which led to an awkward recall ). Its stars made appearances at the Met Gala and the Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe had roughly 400 global brand partners on \u2018Wicked,\u2019 so the campaign was inescapable, said Orr. \u201cAnd our cast, led by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, worked so hard on this. They were everywhere. They did everything we asked them to do.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend, box office was down about 11% from last year and some 25% from pre-pandemic times. That meant this week's two headline films led a much-needed resurgence for theaters. With \u201cMoana 2\u201d releasing Wednesday, Hollywood might be looking at historic sales over the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\u201cThis weekend\u2019s two strong openers are invigorating a box office that fell apart after a good summer,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "Though \u201cWicked\u201d will face some direct competition from \u201cMoana 2,\u201d it would seem better set up for a long and lucrative run in theaters than \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Though some have dinged \u201cWicked\u201d for running long, at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film has had mostly stellar reviews. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore. The reception for \u201cWicked\u201d has been strong enough that Oscar prognosticators expect it to be a contender for best picture at the Academy Awards, among other categories.",
      "Producers, perhaps sensing a hit, also took the step of splitting \u201cWicked\u201d in two. Part two, already filmed, is due out next November. Each \u201cWicked\u201d installation cost around $150 million to make.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d has also enjoyed good reviews, particularly for Washington's charismatic performance. Audience scores, though, were weaker, with ticket buyers giving it a \u201cB\u201d on CinemaScore. The film will make up for some of that, however, with robust international sales. It launched in many overseas markets a week ago, and has already accrued $165.5 million internationally.",
      "Coming in a distant third place for the weekend was \u201cRed One,\u201d the Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans holiday movie turned action film. In its second week of release, the Amazon MGM Studios release grossed $13.3 million to bring its two-week global haul to $117 million. At a cost of $250 million to make, \u201cRed One\u201d is the season's biggest flop, though it could recoup some value for Amazon if it's more popular once it begins streaming.",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \"Wicked,\" $114 million.",
      "2. \u201cGladiator II,\u201d $55.5 million.",
      "3. \u201cRed One,\u201d $13.3 million.",
      "4. \u201cBonhoeffer: Pastor Spy Assassin,\" $5.1 million.",
      "5. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $4 million.",

      "\u201cYeah, I saw them but I\u2019m not so focused on that. I\u2019m focused on winning with my team,\u201d Fighting Irish star Hannah Hidalgo said. \"I came into the game knowing this was going to be a big hoopla game, which I appreciate, and they were going to bring in all the celebrities and all the fans they needed.\u201d",

      "With his surprise-dropped \u201cGNX,\u201d Kendrick Lamar roars from zero to 60 faster than a turbocharged \u201987 Buick, faster than you can shout \u201cMustaaaaard.\u201d And waaaaay faster than you can decode the dense biblical centerpiece \u201cReincarnated.\u201d",
      "Keeping the same energy of his landmark Pop Out concert five months ago, Lamar surrounds himself with up-and-coming Los Angeles artists \u2014 from AzChike to Peysoh \u2014 and raps over thumping New West Coast soundscapes shaped by his longtime producer Sounwave, along with Jack Antonoff and a garageful of other beat mechanics. He\u2019s once again \u201cpossessed by a spirit,\u201d sprinkling 2Pac, Biggie and Nas references throughout and maintaining a me-against-the-world antipathy that includes but extends well beyond a certain Canadian: \u201cI just strangled me a GOAT\u201d and \u201cnow it\u2019s plural.\u201d",
      "Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Andrew Schulz, and even Fox\u2019s Super Bowl broadcast can\u2019t escape K-Dot\u2019s chaotic crosshairs. Here\u2019s hoping the chorus of \u201ctv off\u201d \u2014 an urgent call to \u201cturn this TV off\u201d repeated eight times \u2014 confuses the masses during his New Orleans halftime show in February.",
      "This is Lamar leaning into the same creativity-juicing pride, self-righteous anger and supreme confidence that fueled the Grammy-nominated \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and won his Drake feud: \u201cI kill \u2018em all before I let \u2018em kill my joy.\u201d And yet, as with his first-ever hit \u201cSwimming Pools (Drank),\u201d even the most club-ready braggadocio songs \u2014 and there are plenty, including the massive \u201csquabble up\u201d and synth-stabbed Mustard production \u201chey now\u201d \u2014 are slapped with a caution sticker. Introspection is baked into Lamar\u2019s art. In \u201cman at the garden,\u201d he\u2019s surveying his kingdom and glory and declares that while \u201cI deserve it all,\u201d \u201cdangerously / nothing changed with me / still got pain in me.\u201d",
      "At age 37, Lamar remains in peak form (that breath control!) and stands alone in the rap world as a star who bridges generations without chasing trends. He generates his own gravity in the hip-hop universe. Pulling samples from the early \u201980s \u2014 Debbie Deb, Luther Vandross, Whodini \u2014 he\u2019s able to switch cadences and lyrical perspectives mid-song without ever losing the listener.",
      "Album closer \u201cgloria,\u201d one of two tracks featuring former TDE labelmate SZA, is a glorious celebration of the pain and power of writing. In the vein of Common\u2019s \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d or Nas\u2019 \u201cI Gave You Power,\u201d Lamar\u2019s love story details a \u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d that listeners at first may think is about his longtime partner Whitney Alford, but turns out to be dedicated to his pen.",
      "While carefully structured, \u201cGNX\u201d feels a bit more scattershot than Lamar\u2019s traditionally concept-heavy studio albums. And there are hints that this collection of 12 songs is more of a \u201cPart 1\u201d or mixtape-type prelude to something more formal: The brief music video announcing the album features a snippet of a song that doesn\u2019t even appear on \u201cGNX.\u201d",
      "Whatever comes next, the Pulitzer Prize winner has written another thrilling chapter in what remains the most fascinating longform story in hip-hop: an ambitious and searingly talented poet from Compton working through his \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 contradictions on the biggest stage, forever discomforted by his crown. ___",

      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \u201cChuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\u201d Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV\u2019s \u201cLove Connection,\u201d for which he coined the phrase, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\u201d a two-fingered signature dubbed the \u201c2 and 2.\u201d In 1984, he hosted TV\u2019s \u201cScrabble,\u201d simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\u201cLove Connection,\u201d which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest\u2019s choice, \u201cLove Connection\u201d would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, \u2018I remember wagon trains.\u2019 The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\u201d",

In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV\u2019s \u201cMelrose Place.\u201d",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network\u2019s first attempt at a reality show, \u201cChuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\u201d which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d debuted Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d started life as \u201cShopper\u2019s Bazaar,\u201d incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show\u201d singing \u201cDelta Dawn,\u201d Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\u201cI had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\u201d Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \u201cAfter the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, \u2018Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn\u2019t care what you have to say \u2014 that\u2019s the guy I want to be.\u2019\u201d",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and got the green light.

      "\u201cBoth Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and \u2018Wheel\u2019 did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 achieved in its heyday,\u201d Griffin said in \u201cMerv: Making the Good Life Last,\u201d an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which tourbed in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \u201cNaturally Stoned,\u201d with Woolery singing, \u201cWhen I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I\u2019m naturally stoned.\u201d",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \u201cI\u2019ve Been Wrong\u201d in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \u201cForgive My Heart\u201d and \u201cLove Me, Love Me.\u201d",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette\u2019s 1971 album \u201cWe Sure Can Love Each Other,\u201d Woolery wrote \u201cThe Joys of Being a Woman\u201d with lyrics including \u201cSee our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\u201d",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn\u2019t revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \u201cBlunt Force Truth\u201d and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don\u2019t need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\u201d he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \u201cImpeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\u201d",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump\u2019s chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust.

    "title": "Has a waltz written by composer Frederic Chopin been discovered in an NYC museum?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:42:30 -0500",
    "summary": "A previously unknown musical work written by composer Frederic Chopin appears to have been found in a library in New York City",
    "story": [
      "A previously unknown musical work written by composer Frederic Chopin appears to have been found in a library in New York City",
      "NEW YORK -- The brooding waltz was carefully composed on a sheet of music roughly the size of an index card. The brief, moody number also bore an intriguing name, written at the top in cursive: \u201cChopin.\u201d",
      "A previously unknown work of music penned by the European master Frederic Chopin appears to have been found at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan.",
      "The untitled and unsigned piece is on display this month at the opulently appointed institution, which had once been the private library of financier J. P. Morgan.",
      "Robinson McClellan, the museum curator who uncovered the manuscript, said it's the first new work associated with the Romantic era composer to be discovered in nearly a century.",
      "But McClellan concedes that it may never be known whether it is an original Chopin work or merely one written in his hand.",
      "The piece, set in the key of A minor, stands out for its \u201cvery stormy, brooding opening section\u201d before transitioning to a melancholy melody more characteristic of Chopin, McClellan explained.",
      "\u201cThis is his style. This is his essence,\u201d he said during a recent visit to the museum. \u201cIt really feels like him.\u201d",
      "McClellan said he came across the work in May as he was going through a collection from the late Arthur Satz, a former president of the New York School of Interior Design. Satz had acquired it from A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., an avid autograph collector who had been director of the school.",
      "McClellan then worked with experts to verify its authenticity.",
      "The paper was found to be consistent with what Chopin favored for manuscripts, and the ink matched a kind typical in the early 19th century when Chopin lived, according to the museum. But a handwriting analysis determined the name \u201cChopin\u201d written at the top of the sheet was penned by someone else.",
      "Born in Poland, Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age. He lived in Warsaw and Vienna before settling in Paris, where he died in 1849 at the age of 39, likely of tuberculosis.",
      "He\u2019s buried among a pantheon of artists at the city\u2019s famed P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, but his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is housed in a church in Warsaw, in keeping with his deathbed wish for the organ to return to his homeland.",
      "Artur Szklener, director of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, the Polish capital city where the composer grew up, agreed that the document is consistent with the kinds of ink and paper Chopin used during his early years in Paris.",
      "Musically, the piece evokes the \u201cbrilliant style\u201d that made Chopin a luminary in his time, but it also has features unusual for his compositions, Szklener said.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, it is not a complete work, but rather a certain musical gesture, a theme laced with rather simple piano tricks alluding to a virtuoso style,\" Szklener explained in a lengthy statement released after the document was revealed last month.",
      "He and other experts conjecture the piece could have been a work in progress. It may have also been a copy of another's work, or even co-written with someone else, perhaps a student for a musical exercise.",
      "Jeffrey Kallberg, a University of Pennsylvania music professor and Chopin expert who helped authenticate the document, called the piece a \u201clittle gem\u201d that Chopin likely intended as a gift for a friend or wealthy acquaintance.",
      "\u201cMany of the pieces that he gave as gifts were short \u2013 kind of like \u2018appetizers\u2019 to a full-blown work,\u201d Kallberg said in an email. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know for sure whether he intended the piece to see the light of day because he often wrote out the same waltz more than once as a gift.\u201d",
      "David Ludwig, dean of music at The Juilliard School, a performing arts conservatory in Manhattan, agreed the piece has many of the hallmarks of the composer\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cIt has the Chopin character of something very lyrical and it has a little bit of darkness as well,\u201d said Ludwig, who was not involved in authenticating the document.",
      "But Ludwig noted that, if it's authentic, the tightly composed score would be one of Chopin\u2019s shortest known pieces. The waltz clocks in at under a minute long when played on piano, as many of Chopin\u2019s works were intended.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the authenticity of it, in a way it doesn\u2019t matter because it sparks our imaginations,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cA discovery like this highlights the fact that classical music is very much a living art form.\u201d",
      "The Chopin reveal comes after the Leipzig Municipal Libraries in Germany announced in September that it had uncovered a previously unknown piece likely composed by a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in its collections.",

      "As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade.",
      "The unveiling of the exhibition \u201cEye to Eye\u201d has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran's Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country's theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars.",
      "\u201cThe first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,\u201d said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum.",
      "\u201cIf such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it\u2019s enough. They are really precious.\u201d",
      "The government of Iran\u2019s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran\u2019s cultural standing on the world stage.",
      "But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum\u2019s vault. Some paintings \u2014 cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art \u2014 sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution.",
      "Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes.",
      "Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, \u201cJacqueline Kennedy II,\u201d is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that\u2019s why this show distinguishes itself from others,\u201d said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition's curator. \u201dA lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.\u201d",
      "The presence of Western art comes as Iran's government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a \u201csoft\u201d cultural war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country's politics or Shiite religion.",
      "Among the visitors were many women defying the country's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran's presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger.",
      "And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran's collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It\u2019s extremely exciting to see the works here,\u201d said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. \u201cI had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted",
      "NEW YORK -- When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted.",
      "Cole, one of the most important chroniclers of apartheid-era South Africa, was by then mostly forgotten and penniless. Banned by his native country after the publication of his pioneering photography book \u201cHouse of Bondage,\u201d Cole had emigrated in 1966 to the United States. But his life in exile gradually disintegrated into intermittent homelessness. A six-paragraph obituary in The New York Times ran alongside a list of death notices.",
      "But Cole receives a vibrant and stirring resurrection in Raoul Peck\u2019s new film \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d narrated in Cole\u2019s own words and voiced by LaKeith Stanfield. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, is laced throughout with Cole\u2019s photographs, many of them not before seen publicly.",
      "As he did in his Oscar-nominated James Baldwin documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d the Haitian-born Peck shares screenwriting credit with his subject. \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is drawn from Cole\u2019s own writings. In words and images, Peck brings the tragic story of Cole to vivid life, reopening the lens through which Cole so perceptively saw injustice and humanity.",
      "\u201cFilm is a political tool for me,\u201d Peck said in a recent interview over lunch in Manhattan. \u201cMy job is to go to the widest audience possible and try to give them something to help them understand where they are, what they are doing, what role they are playing. It\u2019s about my fight today. I don\u2019t care about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is a movie layered with meaning that goes beyond Cole\u2019s work. It asks questions not just about the societies Cole documented but of how he was treated as an artist, drawing uncomfortable parallels between apartheid and post-Jim Crow America. In the U.S., Cole was given a Ford Foundation grant to capture Black life in rural and urban areas, but he struggled to find a foothold professionally. Some editors said his images lacked \u201cedge.\u201d",
      "In 2017, more than 60,000 of Cole\u2019s 35mm film negatives were discovered in a bank vault in Stockholm, Sweden. Much of that material, including thousands of photographs Cole took in the U.S., was believed lost. Answers for how they had gotten there, and why they hadn't been known about earlier were hard to come by. \u201cLost and Found\u201d portrays the struggle of Cole's estate to acquire the collection. Only on the eve of the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere in May did the bank finally announce the handover of most materials to the estate.",
      "What those photographs reveal is an artist who made much more than indelible images of apartheid life. Cole\u2019s early photographs, published in 1967, offered one of the most illustrative and damning portraits of apartheid to Western eyes, including a widely reproduced photograph of a middle-aged woman sitting on a park bench that read \u201cEuropean\u2019s only.\u201d But he was an equally astute and sensitive observer of the segregations, and multicultural joys, of American life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d Stanfield narrates as Cole. \u201cSteal every moment.\u201d",
      "For Peck, the themes of \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d are deeply personal. The 71-year-old filmmaker, a former minister of culture in Haiti, has spent much of his artistic life also away from his native country, in Berlin, Paris and New York. He dedicates the movie \u201cto those who died in exile.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I say that, that\u2019s most of my friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI recognize all the steps. When you take a contact sheet, I see myself.\u201d",
      "For some four decades, Peck has made some of the most urgent films, in both fiction (including 2000\u2019s \u201cLumumba,\u201d about the exiled Congo leader) and non-fiction (including last year\u2019s \u201cSilver Dollar Road\u201d ). But he has rarely not employed both narrative and documentary elements in films that take their own shape \u2014 movies less interested in genre distinctions than they are pursuing unexamined truths.",
      "That\u2019s made Peck an increasingly exceptional figure in a documentary world that\u2019s become more and more dominated by glossier, less probing films for streaming platforms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse. There\u2019s less money so young people are desperate and accept stuff that my generation would never accept,\u201d Peck says. \u201cThe whole industry has changed. I knew another world, and I recognize it\u2019s not that anymore.\u201d",
      "Peck is currently editing a documentary on George Orwell. Like \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d it will be told totally in Orwell\u2019s words. A few days after the U.S. election, Peck was working to update a moment in the film that touches on President-elect Donald Trump. Peck has been astonished at how prescient Orwell was on so many current issues \u2014 misinformation, AI, social media, the refugee crisis.",
      "\u201cHe was a really incredible critic of history and how history is even told,\u201d says Peck. \u201cBefore plunging into it, I did not realize how sharp he was about what\u2019s going on today.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me,\u201d he adds, \u201ca film has value if it\u2019s talking to us today.\u201d"

      "Percival Everett\u2019s \u201cJames\u201d has won the National Book Award for fiction",
      "NEW YORK -- Percival Everett's \u201cJames,\u201d a daring reworking of \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d has won the National Book Award for fiction. Jason De Le\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cSoldiers and Kings: Survival and Hope in the World of Human Smuggling\u201d won for nonfiction, where finalists included Salman Rushdie's memoir about his brutal stabbing in 2022, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "The prize for young people's literature was given Wednesday night to Shifa Saltagi Safadi\u2019s coming of age story \u201cKareem Between,\u201d and the poetry award went to Lena Khalaf Tuffaha\u2019s \u201cSomething About Living.\u201d In the translation category, the winner was Y\u00e1ng Shu\u0101ng-z\u01d0\u2019s \u201cTaiwan Travelogue,\u201d translated from the Mandarin Chinese by Lin King.",
      "Judging panels, made up of writers, critics, booksellers and others in the literary community, made their selections from hundreds of submissions, with publishers nominating more than 1,900 books in all. Each of the winners in the five competitive categories received $10,000.",
      "Everett\u2019s win continues his remarkable rise in the past few years. Little known to general readers for decades, the 67-year-old has been a Booker Prize and Pulitzer Prize finalist for such novels as \u201cTrees\u201d and \u201cDr. No\u201d and has seen the novel \u201cErasure\u201d adapted into the Oscar-nominated \u201cAmerican Fiction.\u201d",
      "In taking on Mark Twain\u2019s classic about the wayward Southern boy Huck and the enslaved Jim, Everett tells the story from the latter's perspective and emphasizes how differently Jim behaves and even speaks when whites are not around. The novel was a Booker finalist and last month won the Kirkus Prize for fiction.",
      "\u201cJames\u201d has been nicely received,\u201d Everett noted during his acceptance speech.",
      "\u201cDemon Copperhead\u201d novelist Barbara Kingsolver and Black Classic Press publisher W. Paul Coates received lifetime achievement medals from the National Book Foundation, which presents the awards.",
      "Speakers praised diversity, disruption and autonomy, whether Taiwanese independence or the rights of immigrants in the U.S. Two winners, Safadi and Tuffaha, condemned the year-old Gaza war and U.S. military support for Israel. Neither mentioned Israel by name, but both called the conflict \u201cgenocide\u201d and were met with cheers \u2014 and more subdued responses \u2014 after calling for support of the Palestinians.",
      "Tuffaha, who is Palestinian American, dedicated her award in part to \u201cto all the deeply beautiful Palestinians that this world has lost and all those miraculous ones who endured, waiting for us, waiting for us to wake up.\u201d",
      "Last year publisher Zibby Owens withdrew support for the awards after hearing that finalists were planning to condemn the Gaza war. This year the World Jewish Congress was among those criticizing Coates\u2019 award, citing in part his reissue of the essay \u201cThe Jewish Onslaught,\u201d which has been called anti-Semitic.",
      "National Book Foundation Executive Director Ruth Dickey said in a recent statement that Coates was being honored for a body of work rather than any individual book, and added that while the foundation condemns anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, it also believes in free expression.",
      "\u201cAnyone examining the work of any publisher, over the course of almost five decades, will find individual works or opinions with which they disagree or find offensive,\u201d she added.",
      "The National Book Awards have long taken place in mid-November, shortly after the elections, and they're an early snapshot of the book world's reaction: Hopeful after Barack Obama's victory in 2008, when publisher and honorary winner Barney Rosset anticipated \u201ca new and uplifting agenda\u201d; grim but determined in 2016, after Donald Trump's first victory, with fiction winner Colson Whitehead urging the audience to \u201cbe kind to everybody, make art, and fight the power.\u201d",
      "This year, as hundreds gathered for the dinner ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan for the awards' 75th anniversary, the mood was one of sobriety, resolve and willed good cheer.",
      "Host Kate McKinnon joked that she was recruited because the National Book Foundation wanted \u201csomething fun and light and to distract from the fact that the world is a bonfire.\u201d Musical guest Jon Batiste led the audience in a round of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d and sang a few lines from \u201cHallelujah,\u201d the Leonard Cohen standard which McKinnon somberly performed at the start of the first \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after the 2016 election.",
      "Kingsolver acknowledged feeling \u201csmacked down, at the moment,\u201d but added that she has known despair before. She likened truth and love to forces of nature, like gravity and the sun, always there whether you see them or not. The writer's job is to imagine \u201ca better ending than the one we've been given,\" she said.",
      "At a Tuesday night reading by awards finalists, some spoke of community and support. Everett began his turn by confiding that he really \u201cneeded this kind of inspiration after the last couple of weeks. We kind of need each other right now.\u201d After warning that \u201chope is not a strategy,\u201d he paused and said, \u201cNever had a situation felt so absurd, surreal and ridiculous.\u201d",
      "It took a moment to realize he wasn't discussing current events, but rather reading from \u201cJames.\u201d"

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

      "Two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their names \u2014 MSNBC and CNBC \u2014 will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News once a spinoff formally takes effect in about a year",
      "Comcast's corporate reorganization means that there will soon be two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their name \u2014 CNBC and MSNBC \u2014 that will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News.",
      "How that affects viewers of those networks, along with the people who work there, still needs to shake out. Their new corporate leader, Mark Lazarus, visited the set of MSNBC's \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as the plan was being announced on Wednesday and spoke to network staff members during a morning conference call to address concerns.",
      "Comcast is spinning off most of its cable networks, also including USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and the Golf Channel, into a separate company. That recognizes how streaming is considered the future and the cable networks are a drag on the bottom line.",
      "In the space of a lifetime, the networks went from upstarts aside a legacy operation like NBC to profitable superstars to castoffs.",
      "Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Universal Media Group, is becoming CEO of the newly-formed company of cable networks, temporarily dubbed \u201cSpinCo.\u201d Cesar Conde, who as NBC Universal News Group chairman had oversight of CNBC and MSNBC, will lose those networks from his portfolio, yet remain in charge of NBC News, NBC News Now streaming, Telemundo and the news operations of the NBC-owned local stations.",
      "The presence of Lazarus and Anand Kini, who will be chief operating officer and chief financial officer of SpinCo, is a good sign for the new company, said Jessica Reif Ehrlich, research analyst for the Bank of America. \u201cYou can't dismiss it as getting rid of the crappy assets, because these are talented executives,\u201d she said.",
      "At MSNBC, questions about the future range from the simple \u2014 will it even keep its name? \u2014 to the complex.",
      "MSNBC's staff and studios are based in the same Rockefeller Center offices as NBC News, and it was unclear on Wednesday whether they will remain or move elsewhere, Lazarus told MSNBC employees.",
      "MSNBC's relationship with NBC News has caused some awkwardness, particularly as the network has become known for its stable of liberal commentators while still attached to a news division that stresses impartiality. For much of MSNBC's broadcast day, NBC News journalists like Katy Tur, Jose Diaz-Balart, Chris Jansing and a host of reporters appear on the network.",
      "It's unclear whether arrangements could be made for that cross-pollination to continue \u2014 where will Steve Kornacki land, for example? \u2014 or if MSNBC will bear the expense of building out its own newsgathering operation or lean more heavily into commentary.",
      "It's a nervous time at MSNBC for other reasons. The network has seen a dramatic drop in viewership since Donald Trump's election victory, although it is common that news networks that appeal primarily to one side of a political divide lose viewers when their candidates are defeated. History shows most viewers return, and MSNBC executives anticipate that.",
      "Less clear is whether a second Trump administration will make life difficult. Trump ally Steve Bannon, on his radio show last week, sent out a specific warning to the network's anchors and producers. \u201cYou better be worried,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better lawyer up.\u201d",
      "CNBC launched in 1989, while MSNBC started in 1996. They have seemed inextricably bound with the broadcast network since, and the sharing of legal, promotional, technical and other support is something else that needs to be worked out.",
      "With its financial concentration, CNBC has been more independent of NBC News than its cable brethren. With offices in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., its operation is even physically separate. However, NBC News often taps CNBC reporters for their business expertise on broadcast and its streaming service.",
      "\u201cI completely empathize with people who think this would be a bittersweet thing,\u201d Lazarus said, according to MSNBC. \u201cI think it's exciting because very few times in life you get to have the opportunity to be part of what I'll call a \u2018well-funded startup.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the old-school nature of a company of cable properties, Comcast executives are bullish on its prospects, noting that many of them produce profits individually. And there's the potential for buying other networks undervalued by big media companies.",
      "Andrew Ross Sorkin, host of CNBC's \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Wednesday that the two cable news networks produce \u201dextraordinary profits\" for Comcast that are not being reinvested in cable properties.",
      "\"If you could take that money that's coming off of these channels and invest in the businesses as an independent entity, what will that ultimately look like\"?\" Sorkin asked. \u201cCould you use that money to go make other acquisitions? Could you make investments in the business itself? That's the big question.\u201d",
      "One piece of advice from Bank of America's Ehrlich: Keep the names. \u201cThose are pretty big brand names,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not advise them to change.\u201d",

      "The Illinois Supreme Court has overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lied to Chicago police",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lying to Chicago police, saying he should not have been charged a second time after reaching a deal with prosecutors.",
      "The ruling, which did not address Smollett's continued claims of innocence, was the latest twist in a yearslong saga. Smollett, who is Black and gay, made headlines around the world after he told police in January 2019 that two men assaulted him in his downtown Chicago neighborhood, spouting slurs, tossing a noose around his neck, and yelling that he was in \u201cMAGA country,\u201d an apparent reference to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d presidential campaign slogan. The report prompted a massive search for suspects by Chicago police before investigators announced that they believed the attack was a hoax.",
      "The state's highest court found that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after Smollett reached a deal with the Cook County state\u2019s attorney in which charges against him were dropped in exchange for him forfeiting his $10,000 bond and performing community service. The deal prompted outrage in part because it did not include any condition that Smollett apologize or admit he staged the attack.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,\u201d Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the court\u2019s 5-0 opinion. \u201cNevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.\u201d",
      "Smollett was on the television drama \u201cEmpire,\u201d which filmed in Chicago, and prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio\u2019s response to hate mail he received. Testimony at trial indicated he paid $3,500 to two men whom he knew from \u201cEmpire\u201d to carry it out. Smollett testified that \u201cthere was no hoax\u201d and that he was the victim of a hate crime.",
      "Smollett declined to comment Thursday through a publicist. His attorney, Nenye Uche, said Smollett was happy and relieved but also disappointed to have been \u201cdragged through an unfair process.\u201d",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who helped two hired killers after they gunned down rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery will not serve time in prison under a sentence of six years' probation, a judge ruled Friday.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson, 27, pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the shooting. Johnson helped Cornelius Smith Jr. and Justin Johnson, his half-brother, communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities after the daytime ambush.",
      "Justin Johnson was convicted on Sept. 26 of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 35 years. Smith has been charged with first-degree murder and he testified at Justin Johnson's trial, saying they fatally shot Young Dolph.",
      "Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell sentenced Jermarcus Johnson to a six-year diversionary program where he will undergo job training, submit to drug testing, refrain from possessing a gun and serve 20 hours of community service per year. His record could be cleared if he successfully completes the program.",
      "Speaking with reporters after the sentencing, prosecutor Paul Hagerman noted that Jermarcus Johnson had no role in the actual killing of Young Dolph.",
      "\u201cHe was used by his brother,\u201d Hagerman said. \"He is not a criminal.\"",
      "Young Dolph, whose real name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was fatally shot in November 2021 at a bakery located near the house where he grew up. Known for charitable works in Memphis, the 36-year-old rapper and independent music label owner was in the city to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an event that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Justin Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of his artists were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "Hagerman, the prosecutor, told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cnumber two person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "During the hearing where he pleaded guilty, Jermarcus Johnson acknowledged taking possession of a cellphone and car from Justin Johnson. Jermarcus Johnson also identified a photo in which Justin Johnson was wearing the same clothing as one of the two shooters.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson also testified during his half-brother's trial. His lawyer, Josh Corman, said Friday that Jermarcus Johnson \u201cwas put in a bad situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all think it's a fair resolution,\u201d Corman said.",
      "Another man, Hernandez Govan, whom Smith identified as a go-between with Big Jook, has pleaded not guilty to organizing the killing. Govan\u2019s trial has been set for March 10.",
      "Right after the shooting, Makeda's Homemade Cookies turned into a makeshift memorial for Young Dolph, with fans praying in the parking lot and writing messages of condolences and love on plywood covering the shot-out windows. The bakery closed for months but has since reopened.",
      "He also was honored by the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA during a game. Murals of the rapper were painted around the city. A neighborhood street was named after him.",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \u201cKing of Memphis.\u201d He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others.",
      "Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020's \u201cRich Slave\u201d peaking at No. 4."

      "Alice Brock has died at age 83",
      "NEW YORK -- Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \u201cAlice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Her death, just a week before Thanksgiving, was announced Friday by Guthrie on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records. Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. Other details were not immediately available.",
      "\u201cThis coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\u201d Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we\u2019d never have another chance to talk together.\u201d",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend, Richard Robbins, were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014 whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant \u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant / Walk right in it\u2019s around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant.",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of the popular culture. \u201cAlice's Restaurant\u201d was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name. Alice Brock would write a memoir, \u201cMy Life as a Restaurant,\u201d and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \u201cMooses Come Walking.\u201d At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband. Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \u201cAlice's Restaurant\u201d advised: \u201cYou can get anything you want\u201d at Alice's Restaurant, \u201cexcepting Alice.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- The microbudget movie \"Hundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into lo-fi legend. Mike Cheslik\u2019s film, made for just $150,000 and self-distributed in theaters, has managed to gnaw its way into a movie culture largely dominated by big-budget sequels.",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a wordless black-and-white bonanza of slapstick antics about a stranded 19th century applejack salesman, played by his friend Ryland Tews, at war with a bevy of beavers, all of whom are played by actors in mascot costumes. It's played in at least one theater a week since opening in January. On Dec. 5, it will play in more theaters than any point before.",
      "It's no overnight sensation. It's been two years since Cheslik first premiered \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d",
      "Here's how it happened:",
      "Like all great ideas, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d started at a bar. In October 2018, Cheslik and Tews \u2014 friends since they were 15 growing up in Wisconsin \u2014 were talking over how they could expand from their last film, \u201cLake Michigan Monster,\u201d an antic, even lower budgeted B-movie about the hunt for a Great Lakes sea monster. It culminated in an elaborate animation sequence by Cheslik, a trial run for \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d",
      "For their next movie, Cheslik imagined something reminiscent of childhood, with snowball fights and sled chases. Oh, and mascot costumes. \u201cBecause mascots falling down is a universal language,\u201d Tews says. \u201cEveryone thinks that\u2019s funny.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love slapstick and I don\u2019t know why it was a dormant genre for so long,\u201d adds Cheslik. \u201cMy guess is that when a country shifts from having more physical jobs to more of a service economy then the sense of humor becomes more verbal. The alligator in a pit is an HR referral instead of getting hurt at your job.\u201d",
      "They made \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d over two winters during the pandemic, with pick-up shoots in between. It wasn\u2019t particularly fun work \u2014 they were outside in negative degree weather schlepping gear through the snow. But they were making exactly the movie they wanted, without compromise. And it didn\u2019t resemble anything at the multiplex.",
      "\u201cRyland and I complained about movies a lot during the making of \u2018Hundreds of Beavers,\u2019\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cI think we just complained for six years straight.\u201d",
      "Cheslik and Tews are not proponents of high-priced gear. Making a movie, they say, doesn\u2019t have be an 8K camera and a rented location.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not camera nerds,\u201d says Cheslik. \u201cWe just like images with strong shapes. We like to say: Shapes are free.\u201d",
      "In editing, Cheslik brought those shapes into greater relief. \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d plays out as a surreal ballet of chiaroscuro pratfalls, with cartoonish figures set against a white winter expanse. The beavers, themselves, never totaled more than six, with Tews, Cheslik or friends variously acting inside the costumes. Almost every shot in the movie required at least some effects work.",
      "\u201cWhat you can do is go on your computer and take those six and duplicate them. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 12 beavers. I\u2019m talkin\u2019, imagine a number, 18,\u201d deadpans Cheslik. \u201cIt\u2019s technical stuff.\u201d",
      "Once it was finally done, they excitedly hit the festival circuit. After debuting \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d at the Fantastic Fest, they played more festivals. And then some more. The crowd reaction was great and they won an audience award at the Fantasia Film Festival in 2023. But a decent offer never came. The old way of shopping a movie at a festival, they found, didn\u2019t really exist anymore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to make a movie,\u201d says Tews. \u201cThat\u2019s just the very beginning.\u201d",
      "Producer Kurt Ravenwood decided to explore a self release. They sold streaming rights to Cineverse, the company that recently distributed the indie horror hit \u201cTerrifier 3.\u201d But they kept theatrical, merchandising and Blu-ray rights.",
      "\u201cIt was a calculated risk to keep theatrical rights to ourselves,\u201d Ravenwood says. \u201cWe had never, ever in our lives put on a theatrical run. But we knew that if we were able to get it booked, it would do well.\u201d",
      "They hired a distribution veteran to help book theaters and a publicist to spread the word. And they crossed their fingers.",
      "\u201cWe believe that indie movies that go into the digital nothingness of streaming don\u2019t get into the culture,\u201d says Ravenwood. \u201cSo we kicked it off with this roadshow. At first, we needed to prove to theaters that people would show up. Besides just the movie, we\u2019d bring the circus to town.\u201d",
      "Calling it the \u201cGreat Lakes Roadshow,\u201d they rented out theaters and played \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d to mostly sold-out screenings in the Midwest. They didn\u2019t just play the movie, but created a vaudeville act to go along with it. The beaver mascot costumes came out of the closet.",
      "\u201cIf anything, this is what Instagram creators and TikTok creators are used to every day,\u201d says Ravenwood. \u201cThey both make the content and distribute the content via platform. If filmmakers want to reach an audience, they have to treat it like online creators treat it.\u201d",
      "Their quixotic gambit worked. People and media started taking notice. \u201cBeaver fever,\u201d as they say, took hold. None of it happened quickly, or easily. Ravenwood shipped a lot of posters and digital versions of the film. Cheslik and Tews spent two years just releasing their movie. Six years had passed since they had started. Making \u201cThe Revenant\u201d looked, comparatively, like a piece of cake. But they did it.",
      "\u201cIt was a life goal that was achieved,\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cWhich is just a horrible thing to have happen.\u201d",
      "They are already pondering their next movie; notecards hung on the wall behind Cheslik. For now, he\u2019s only saying that it will, like \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d feature precise physical comedy.",
      "The beaver suits? Cheslik imagines they must now be filled with black mold that after being torn and repaired countless times, going through two Wisconsin winters, dozens of festivals and some 20 roadshows.",
      "Next time, he and Tews hope is a little easier \u2014 a little easier to make a living from, and a little easier to find their way into theaters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love when people say, \u2018Our goal with this film just to get it out there. I don\u2019t care if I make money,\u2019\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cAre these films vanity projects for trust fund hobbyists, or is this an industry?\u201d"

      "HOUSTON -- Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.",
      "The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.",
      "\u201cIt was miserable,\u201d Rubit said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it.\u201d",
      "Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d caused roughly half a million outages.",
      "People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.",
      "At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is \"actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid.",
      "Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston\u2019s power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.",
      "CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: \u201cto build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.\u201d",
      "Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.",
      "The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. \u201cThere are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.",
      "Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can\u2019t disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius).",
      "In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.",
      "The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated that we didn\u2019t get the services that we needed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that we have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn\u2019t meant to be used for long periods.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything from CenterPoint,\" Burks said. \"We\u2019re always the last to get it.\u201d"

      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",

      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress.

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Less is known about Trump's pick for the Atlanta-based CDC, which develops vaccines and monitors for infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "Weldon is a staunch, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican. Legislation he introduced more than 20 years ago outlawed human cloning. He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",
      "Weldon's nomination is likely to placate some anti-abortion advocates, who have been concerned about Trump's nomination of Kennedy, a longtime Democrat and proponent of abortion rights, as the nation's top health official.",
      "Weldon retired from his congressional seat in 2008, after 14 years in public office. Earlier this year, he lost in a GOP primary for a seat in the Florida Legislature.",
      "If he's confirmed, he'll be in charge of more than 13,000 employees and nearly 13,000 other contract workers.",
      "Nesheiwat, meanwhile, will oversee 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members if the Republican-controlled Senate approves her nomination as the surgeon general. She is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York. She appears regularly on Fox News and has expressed frequent support for Trump, sharing photos of them together on her social media pages.",
      "Surgeons general also have the power to issue advisories, warning of public health threats in the U.S. Those advisories can influence how the government, public and medical community respond to health crises in the country.",

      "Dr. Firat Sari is one of 47 people on trial accused of transferring newborn babies to neonatal units of private hospitals, where they were allegedly kept for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments in order to receive social security payments.",
      "\u201cPatients were referred to me because people trusted me. We did not accept patients by bribing anyone from 112,\u201d Sari said, referring to Turkey\u2019s emergency medical phone line.",
      "Sari, said to be the plot\u2019s ringleader, operated the neonatal intensive care units of several private hospitals in Istanbul. He is facing a sentence of up to 583 years in prison in a case where doctors, nurses, hospital managers and other health staff are accused of putting financial gain before newborns\u2019 wellbeing.",
      "The case, which emerged last month, has sparked public outrage and calls for greater oversight of the health care system. Authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed 10 of the 19 hospitals that were implicated in the scandal.",
      "\u201cI want to tell everything so that the events can be revealed,\u201d Sari, the owner of Medisense Health Services, told the court. \u201cI love my profession very much. I love being a doctor very much.\u201d",
      "Although the defendants are charged with the negligent homicide of 10 infants since January 2023, an investigative report cited by the state-run Anadolu news agency said they caused the deaths of \u201chundreds\u201d of babies over a much longer time period.",
      "Over 350 families have petitioned prosecutors or other state institutions seeking investigations into the deaths of their children, according to state media.",
      "Prosecutors at the trial, which opened on Monday, say the defendants also falsified reports to make the babies\u2019 condition appear more serious so as to obtain more money from the state as well as from families.",
      "The main defendants have denied any wrongdoing, insisting they made the best possible decisions and are now facing punishment for unavoidable, unwanted outcomes.",
      "Sari is charged with establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime, defrauding public institutions, forgery of official documents and homicide by negligence.",
      "During questioning by prosecutors before the trial, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment.",
      "\u201cEverything is in accordance with procedures,\u201d he told prosecutors in a statement.",
      "The hearings at Bakirkoy courthouse, on Istanbul\u2019s European side, have seen protests outside calling for private hospitals to be shut down and \u201cbaby killers\u201d to be held accountable.",
      "The case has also led to calls for the resignation of Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, who was the Istanbul provincial health director at the time some of the deaths occurred. Ozgur Ozel, the main opposition party leader, has called for all hospitals involved to be nationalized.",
      "In a Saturday interview with the A Haber TV channel, Memisoglu characterized the defendants as \u201cbad apples\u201d who had been \u201cweeded out.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur health system is one of the best health systems in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very exceptional, very organized criminal organization. It is a mistake to evaluate this in the health system as a whole.\u201d",

      "The team that President-elect Donald Trump has selected to lead federal health agencies in his second administration includes a retired congressman, a surgeon and a former talk-show host.",
      "All could play pivotal roles in fulfilling a political agenda that could change how the government goes about safeguarding Americans' health \u2014 from health care and medicines to food safety and science research. In line to lead the Department of Health and Human Services secretary is environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Trump's choices don't have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, are frequent Fox News contributors.",
      "Many on the list were critical of COVID-19 measures like masking and booster vaccinations for young people. Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump's other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years and is affiliated with a medical group on the state's Atlantic coast. Nesheiwat's brother-in-law is Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., tapped by Trump as national security adviser.",
      "Here's a look at the nominees' potential role in carrying out what Kennedy says is the task to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials, and effect Americans' daily lives:",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.",
      "Kennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is \"no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d and urged people to resist the CDC's guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.",
      "Decades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, 71, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.",
      "Starting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines. Kennedy, then a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, believed there was a tie between thimerosal and autism and also charged that the government hid documents showing the danger.",
      "Since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Meanwhile, study after study after study found no evidence that thimerosal caused autism.",
      "Weldon's congressional voting record suggests he may go along with Republican efforts to downsize the CDC, including to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses and shooting deaths. Weldon also voted to ban federal funding for needle-exchange programs as an approach to reduce overdoses, and the National Rifle Association gave him an \u201cA\u201d rating for his pro-gun rights voting record.",
      "Kennedy is extremely critical of the FDA, which has 18,000 employees and is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and other medical products, as well as overseeing cosmetics, electronic cigarettes and most foods.",
      "Makary, Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is closely aligned with Kennedy on several topics. The professor at Johns Hopkins University who is a trained surgeon and cancer specialist has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "Kennedy has suggested he'll clear out \u201centire\u201d FDA departments and also recently threatened to fire FDA employees for \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated products and therapies, including stem cells, raw milk, psychedelics and discredited COVID-era treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Makary's contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic included questioning the need for masking and giving young kids COVID-19 vaccine boosters.",
      "But anything Makary and Kennedy might want to do when it comes to unwinding FDA regulations or revoking long-standing vaccine and drug approvals would be challenging. The agency has lengthy requirements for removing medicines from the market, which are based on federal laws passed by Congress.",
      "The agency provides health care coverage for more than 160 million people through Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and also sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors and other providers. With a $1.1 trillion budget and more than 6,000 employees, Oz has a massive agency to run if confirmed \u2014 and an agency that Kennedy hasn't talked about much when it comes to his plans.",

Oz has endorsed expanding Medicare Advantage \u2014 a privately run version of Medicare that is popular but also a source of widespread fraud \u2014 in an AARP questionnaire during his failed 2022 bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania and in a 2020 Forbes op-ed with a former Kaiser Permanente CEO.",
      "Oz also said in a Washington Examiner op-ed with three co-writers that aging healthier and living longer could help fix the U.S. budget deficit because people would work longer and add more to the gross domestic product.",
      "Neither Trump nor Kennedy have said much about Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income Americans. Trump's first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "Kennedy doesn't appear to have said much publicly about what he'd like to see from surgeon general position, which is the nation's top doctor and oversees 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members.",
      "The surgeon general has little administrative power, but can be an influential government spokesperson on what counts as a public health danger and what to do about it \u2014 suggesting things like warning labels for products and issuing advisories.

      "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
      "Disabled people who use rideshare apps Lyft and Uber say their experience is not a seamless task of pressing a few buttons and being whisked to their destination minutes later.",
      "Instead, people who use wheelchairs and guide dogs have watched drivers cancel rides, charge cleaning fees for guide dogs or outright refuse to take them where they need to go.",
      "The rideshare companies plan to push app updates soon to address cancellations and misunderstandings, but advocates and disabled users say they want to see drivers be better educated about how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and want the companies to put in stricter discrimination policies. The new app features are just \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d said Lynn Dubinsky.",
      "\u201cThis option puts the burden back on the client rather than on the companies themselves to directly address (discrimination) with their drivers,\u201d said Dubinsky, who works for a guide-dog training school in San Rafael, California.",
      "Uber and Lyft have been the target of past federal lawsuits that allege they didn't follow ADA laws; Uber settled its suit in 2022 and Lyft settled a separate one in 2020. While rideshare apps aren't the only option for disabled people across the U.S. \u2014 public transit agencies must also have ADA-compliant buses and trains and offer paratransit options like shuttles \u2014 the disabled community relies on rideshare more than others, according to 2022 U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics.",
      "That's the case for Amber Sherrard, who is blind and has a guide dog named Della.",
      "The 32-year-old Denver resident has grown accustomed to drivers refusing to transport Della, whom she prefers to bring along instead of using a cane, which she says is less safe. Once, she ended up getting a ride from strangers at Denver's airport because a rideshare driver wouldn't allow Della in the car.",
      "Uber's app update will give users a way to identify as blind or deaf. Lyft will allow users to tell a driver they have a service animal \u2014 something that Uber launched as a small pilot program earlier this week in the U.S. and Canada. Both rideshare companies have hotlines for people to report drivers who refuse to allow them into their cars with a service animal.",
      "Sherrard said she's skeptical that the new app features will help, since she usually informs drivers about her guide dog and figured out how to add that she's visually impaired to her profile name to cut down on cancellations.",
      "\u201cJust like every other person in America working multiple jobs, trying to survive, I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d she said of drivers who've denied her rides. \u201cI have just as many bills as anyone else. I have just as many working hours as everyone else. I have just as many errands and things to do to survive as anyone else.\u201d",
      "Robert Silva has had issues with rideshare drivers because of his folding wheelchair, which he has used since losing his right leg in a car accident. The 34-year-old from Alameda, California, said he once tried ordering a rideshare five times in an hour and a half to go to Disneyland before a driver accepted his request.",
      "\u201cThey just see me in a wheelchair, first thing, and they\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s going to be a lot of baggage there,\u201d said Silva, who usually can get into a vehicle without assistance. \u201cI\u2019m sure when they see me they think it\u2019s going to be a lot more work than it actually is.\u201d",
      "Uber and Lyft said their disability policies include following the ADA and not denying rides to people solely because they have a guide dog. The companies also said new drivers are made aware of the policies during onboarding, and that established drivers get occasional reminders of disability policies. If drivers wrongfully decline to accommodate riders because of a service animal, they face a potential ban.",
      "Under the ADA, U.S. cities that have public transportation must provide paratransit at a comparable cost to the regular transit system.",
      "Cathy Johnston, 70, uses Atlanta's MARTA Mobility paratransit program so she doesn't have to leave her power wheelchair behind for a foldable wheelchair like she does when using Uber or Lyft. It's not as timely as rideshare; Johnston said she's had to wait up to 45 minutes \u2014 even after scheduling it at least 24 hours in advance.",
      "\u201cIt makes me mad because hey, I have things I have to do,\u201d she said.",
      "In recent years, 36 transportation programs in 15 states and Washington, D.C., have bolstered paratransit offerings with Uzurv, a rideshare company that specializes in door-to-door service for people with disabilities. The company says it immediately bans drivers who discriminate against disabled riders.",
      "Portland, Oregon, lost a third of its cab fleet because of a drop in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon after, TriMet, the city\u2019s public transit operation, signed a contract with Uzurv.",
      "It's been an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d solution that Eileen Collins Turvey, TriMet's director of accessibility programs, is satisfied with \u2014 so much so that she hopes to make it an on-demand service next year.",
      "But first, she wants to be able to expand all paratransit contractors\u2019 ability to serve wheelchair users.",
      "\u201cWe need to get beyond the floor of the ADA,\u201d she said.",

      "Most people taking popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy to lose weight have shed significant pounds",
      "Unlike scores of people who scrambled for the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy to lose weight in recent years, Danielle Griffin had no trouble getting them.",
      "The 38-year-old information technology worker from New Mexico had a prescription. Her pharmacy had the drugs in stock. And her health insurance covered all but $25 to $50 of the monthly cost.",
      "For Griffin, the hardest part of using the new drugs wasn\u2019t access. It was finding out that the much-hyped medications didn\u2019t really work for her.",
      "\u201cI have been on Wegovy for a year and a half and have only lost 13 pounds,\u201d said Griffin, who watches her diet, drinks plenty of water and exercises regularly. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything right with no success. It\u2019s discouraging.\u201d",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But roughly 10% to 15% of patients in those trials were \u201cnonresponders\u201d who lost less than 5% of their body weight.",
      "Now that millions of people have used the drugs, several obesity experts told The Associated Press that perhaps 20% of patients \u2014 as many as 1 in 5 \u2014 may not respond well to the medications. It's a little-known consequence of the obesity drug boom, according to doctors who caution eager patients not to expect one-size-fits-all results.",
      "\u201cIt's all about explaining that different people have different responses,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity expert at Massachusetts General Hospital",
      "The drugs are known as GLP-1 receptor agonists because they mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1. Genetics, hormones and variability in how the brain regulates energy can all influence weight \u2014 and a person's response to the drugs, Stanford said. Medical conditions such as sleep apnea can prevent weight loss, as can certain common medications, such as antidepressants, steroids and contraceptives.",
      "\u201cThis is a disease that stems from the brain,\u201d said Stanford. \u201cThe dysfunction may not be the same\u201d from patient to patient.",
      "Despite such cautions, patients are often upset when they start getting the weekly injections but the numbers on the scale barely budge.",
      "\u201cIt can be devastating,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. \u201cWith such high expectations, there\u2019s so much room for disappointment.\u201d",
      "That was the case for Griffin, who has battled obesity since childhood and hoped to shed 70 pounds using Wegovy. The drug helped reduce her appetite and lowered her risk of diabetes, but she saw little change in weight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional roller coaster,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want it to work like it does for everybody else.\u201d",
      "The medications are typically prescribed along with eating behavior and lifestyle changes.",
      "It\u2019s usually clear within weeks whether someone will respond to the drugs, said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Weight loss typically begins right away and continues as the dosage increases.",
      "For some patients, that just doesn't happen. For others, side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea force them to halt the medications, Dushay said. In such situations, patients who were counting on the new drugs to pare pounds may think they\u2019re out of options.",
      "\u201cI tell them: It's not game over,\u201d Dushay said.",
      "Trying a different version of the new class of drugs may help. Griffin, who didn't respond well to Wegovy, has started using Zepbound, which targets an additional hormone pathway in the body. After three months of using the drug, she has lost 7 pounds.",
      "\u201cI'm hoping it's slow and steady,\u201d she said.",
      "Other people respond well to older drugs, the experts said. Changing diet, exercise, sleep and stress habits can also have profound effects. Figuring out what works typically requires a doctor trained to treat obesity, Saunders noted.",
      "\u201cObesity is such a complex disease that really needs to be treated very comprehensively,\u201d she said. \u201cIf what we\u2019re prescribing doesn\u2019t work, we always have a backup plan.\u201d",

      "Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day.",
      "Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing.",
      "But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war.",
      "Israel blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving the aid, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border. The U.N. says it often cannot reach the border to pick up aid cargos because the Israeli military denies requests for movement and because of ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. As a result, it says, only about half the incoming aid is distributed.",
      "The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead, and Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza. But after the 30-day ultimatum expired, the Biden administration declined to take any action, saying there had been some progress.",
      "Israel, meanwhile, passed legislation severing ties with UNRWA. Israel accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas \u2014 allegations denied by the U.N.",
      "Israeli news outlets have reported that officials are considering plans for the military to take over aid distribution or contract it out to private security companies. Asked about such plans Wednesday, government spokesman David Mercer said \u201cIsrael is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.\u201d",
      "Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister who was seen as a voice of moderation in the far-right government before being fired this month, warned on X that handing over aid distribution to a private firm was a \u201ceuphemism for the beginning of military rule.\u201d",
      "As that debate plays out in Jerusalem, less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from central Gaza, most Palestinians in the territory are focused on staying alive in a war with no end in sight.",
      "\u201cI find it difficult to talk about the suffering we are experiencing. I am ashamed to talk about it,\u201d said Yasmin\u2019s husband, Hani. \u201cWhat can I tell you? I\u2019m a person who has 21 family members and is unable to provide them with a bag of flour.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.",
      "But four years later, voters in a growing list of its cities have banned the substance.",
      "Four cities, spanning Portland suburbs and rural and coastal towns, added new voter-approved prohibitions for the federally illegal compound in the Nov. 5 election. A dozen other communities that approved two-year moratoriums in 2022, when a majority of Oregon counties and over 100 cities voted to temporarily or permanently ban psilocybin, voted in this election to make the restrictions permanent.",
      "In the wake of the fentanyl crisis, the rejection of drug liberalization measures in Oregon and states across the country this election has some experts questioning whether voters are rethinking their appetite for such policies.",
      "In Massachusetts, for example, voters rejected a measure that would have allowed residents over 21 to grow and use plant-based psychedelic drugs in certain circumstances. All three states that had measures to legalize recreational marijuana voted against it.",
      "Oregon voters, in particular, appear to have soured on drug reform. A law passed by voters four years ago that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including heroin and methamphetamine, was rolled back by the state legislature earlier this year after heated debate over whether it played a role in a spike in public drug use and deaths.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the fact that the drug policy reform pendulum appears to be swinging back towards prohibition is part of a broader trend toward a preference for \u2018law and order\u2019 among American voters,\" said Josh Hardman, founder of Psychedelics Alpha, a consulting firm and newsletter on psychedelic research, business and policy. \u201cOregon, specifically, has been touted as an example of liberal drug policies gone wrong.\"",
      "Despite the local bans, psilocybin remains accessible in over 30 licensed centers spanning the state\u2019s most populous cities, like Portland, and a handful of small towns. Some rural counties also have voted to stay in the program.",
      "However, access to therapeutic psilocybin is further complicated by high costs: One session can be up to $2,000 out of pocket. That is largely because center owners and facilitators have to pass on licensure expenses to consumers in order to stay afloat.",
      "MJ Wilt, who just opened a licensed center in the Portland suburb of Gresham, spent tens of thousands of dollars of her own savings to get licensed and establish her center. It has been hard, she said, because her own experience with psilocybin changed her life for the better and she wants to bring that experience to others.",
      "\u201cThe cost for the program has been astronomical and is not accessible to people across the socioeconomic spectrum,\u201d Wilt said. \u201cIt's certainly not the cash cow that people think or thought it was going to be.\u201d",
      "In 2020, roughly 56% of Oregon voters approved Measure 109, which allowed for the manufacture and controlled, therapeutic use of psilocybin at licensed facilities for those over 21. But the measure allowed counties and cities to vote to opt out, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the state.",
      "Adding to the complexity, some cities have voted to allow psilocybin despite being in counties that banned it, as cities control the land incorporated within their borders while counties control unincorporated land.",
      "The regulatory patchwork resembles that of cannabis law. In half of the 24 states that have legalized recreational cannabis, including Oregon, localities may opt out of most types of cannabis businesses, according to Kate Bryan, a policy specialist on criminal and civil justice at the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Colorado in 2022 became the only other state to legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use. It will begin accepting license applications for \u201chealing centers\u201d at the end of December, a spokesperson for the state's natural medicine division said in an email. The law allows localities to adopt certain regulations regarding how the centers operate, but it does not allow them to ban such centers entirely.",
      "Multiple cities across the country also have voted to decriminalize psilocybin, meaning a person cannot be arrested or prosecuted for possessing limited amounts of plant-based hallucinogens.",
      "Psilocybin, found in several species of mushrooms, can cause hours of vivid hallucinations. Indigenous people have used it in healing rituals, and scientists are exploring whether it can help treat depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Researchers and military veterans are among those who have advocated for the study of the substance for therapeutic use.",
      "Kat Thompson, the founder and CEO of Fractal Soul, a licensed psilocybin center in the Portland suburb of Beaverton, said her center has served 400 people in its first year and that the \u201cvast majority\u201d have had positive outcomes. Many come seeking help for depression, anxiety, trauma and addiction after years of trying talk therapy and medication, she said, while others come to process grief or explore their spirituality.",
      "But she said a lack of public awareness about the state's psilocybin program has led many to confuse it with Measure 110, the separate ballot measure also passed in 2020 that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs. The botched implementation of the law \u2014 also a first of its kind in the nation \u2014 and rising overdose deaths amid the fentanyl crisis fueled pushback that prompted state lawmakers to backtrack on it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe actually got lots of calls from people who had booked sessions with us who heard about the roll back of 110 and thought that that meant that we were closing,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to explain and educate the public that Measure 110 was really just about decriminalization for personal use. It has nothing to do with the professional therapeutic model.\u201d",
      "Some people also confuse the model of the psilocybin center with cannabis dispensaries. At dispensaries, people buy cannabis and leave to consume it elsewhere. People who want to use psilocybin, meanwhile, must consume it at a licensed service center under the supervision of a licensed facilitator who administers it to them and remains with them for the duration of the trip, Thompson said.",
      "\u201cThis is essentially a mental health clinic where someone is here all day with us,\u201d she said. \"By and large, it is extremely safe.\u201d",
      "Of the over 16,000 doses that have been administered since the first licensed center opened in June 2023, staff at such centers have called 911 or taken a patient to a hospital five times, an Oregon Health Authority spokesperson said in an email, confirming reporting from The Oregonian/OregonLive. There are roughly 350 licensed facilitators and a dozen psilocybin manufacturers in the state, according to the agency's most recent figures.",
      "Joe Buck, the mayor of Lake Oswego, a Portland suburb that just passed a psilocybin ban, said he wasn't surprised by the outcome, even though a majority of the city's residents supported Measure 109 in 2020.",
      "\u201cOregon really has not done a great job managing its drug policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can understand how some people may be wary of the promises that are now being made around psilocybin.\u201d",
      "But further research on psilocybin, he said, could change voters' perspective in the future.",
      "\u201cIt really is up to state leaders, leaders in the federal government, to work these drugs through a good system that builds community trust.\""

      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- With their push to end smoking in Atlantic City's casinos going nowhere fast in either the courts or the state Legislature, casino workers and supporters of smoke-free gambling halls demonstrated Thursday outside a hotel where New Jersey's governor was due to speak.",
      "The workers have been pushing for four years to end an exemption in New Jersey's clean air law that allows smoking inside the nine casinos. They say they or their co-workers are becoming ill with cancer, heart disease and other conditions related to exposure to second-hand smoke.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said he will sign a bill to end casino smoking once it reaches his desk. But he has invested little political capital in pushing for it to happen.",
      "His office referred a reporter to a statement he made in a call-in show in September on News 12 New Jersey in which the governor questioned why workers are blaming him for the impasse.",
      "\u201cI have an enormous amount of sympathy with them; they\u2019re somehow blaming this on me,\u201d Murphy said on the show. \u201cI just want to repeat what I have been saying for about five years: If a bill comes to my desk that bans smoking in casinos in Atlantic City, I will sign it. Period. I am not equivocating, and I have not equivocated about that. The way to solve this is through legislation.\"",
      "A bill to end casino smoking has been stalled in the state Legislature for years without the state's Democratic leadership allowing it to progress to full votes in the Senate and Assembly.",
      "And a lawsuit brought by the worker s in April is working its way slowly through the legal system; a judge refused to grant an order in August that would have ended smoking in the gambling halls.",
      "The stalemate added to the frustration of casino workers who say they want the same workplace protections that virtually every other worker in New Jersey receives.",
      "\u201cIt's horrible when you have three, four, five people blowing smoke in your face,\u201d said Sandy Smolen, a dealer at the Borgata casino for the past five years and a 40-year veteran of the industry. \u201cYou can't get away from it. You go home with a cough you didn't have that morning.\u201d",
      "Elaine Rose, a frequent casino patron, voiced similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cAs a player, I've walked into a casino, played a couple hours, and walked out with a bad case of bronchitis,\u201d she said.",
      "Whether to ban smoking is one of the most controversial issues not only in Atlantic City casinos, but in other states where workers have expressed concern about secondhand smoke. They are waging similar campaigns in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Kansas and Virginia.",
      "The Atlantic City casino industry opposes a ban, fearing the loss of significant revenue and jobs if smokers stop coming to Atlantic City and take their business elsewhere.",
      "But opponents say casinos in several parts of the country have successfully gone smoke-free without losing business.",
      "A competing bill that would keep the current 25% limit of the casino floor on which smoking can occur, but impose other limits is also bottled up in the Legislature.",
      "That measure would allow smoking in unenclosed areas of the casino floor that contain slot machines and are designated as smoking areas that are more than 15 feet (4.6 meters) away from table games staffed by live dealers. It also would allow the casinos to offer smoking in enclosed, separately ventilated smoking rooms with the proviso that no worker can be assigned to work in such a room against their will.",
      "Ricky Foster, a supervisor-dealer at the Borgata for 21 years, said the frustration among workers is palpable.",
      "\u201cWe're tired of doing Go Fund Me accounts for people's cancer and heart conditions, and they never smoked a day in their life,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Two Australian teenagers and a British woman have died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos",
      "BANGKOK -- Two Australian teenagers and a British woman died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. An American man and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander also has been sickened. The U.S. State Department issued a warning to travelers to be \u201calert to the potential risk of methanol poisoning.\u201d But what is methanol, and how do you avoid it?",
      "There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol and isopropyl. Ethanol is what is found in consumer spirits and is the only one intended for consumption. Isopropanol is the main ingredient in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Methanol, commonly called wood alcohol because it is the byproduct of wood distillation, is frequently used as fuel and in products such as antifreeze and solvents.",
      "According to the Methanol Institute, the global trade association for the industry, drinking just 25 to 90 ml (0.7 to 3.0 ounces) of methanol can be fatal without proper medical treatment, but can be successfully treated if caught early.",
      "Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness and decreased consciousness including coma, seizure, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and multiple other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention immediately if methanol poisoning is suspected.",
      "\u201cIndividuals vary in their response to methanol,\u201d said toxicologist Alastair Hay from Britain\u2019s University of Leeds. \u201cSome will be able to tolerate more than others because we all have variability in the capacity of our enzymes to detox. But small quantities ... might be fatal for individuals; others may survive slightly more.\u201d",
      "Methanol is sometimes added deliberately by unscrupulous bars to mixed drinks to give them more \u201ckick\u201d and to save money on using higher-priced ethanol-based spirits such as vodka or rum. This practice is not specific to Laos or Southeast Asia, but occurs wherever taxes on legitimate alcohol or the cost of legitimate alcohol is perceived as being too high, according to the Methanol Institute.",
      "Methanol is also a normal product of the distillation process that produces ethanol, and in home-brew distilleries without strict controls \u2014 often found in poorer countries \u2014 it can end up in the mix.",
      "The answer is easy: don't drink it.",
      "But it's colorless, odorless and tasteless, so that can be something of a challenge.",
      "In guidance issued after the Laos poisonings, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office recommends only purchasing alcoholic beverages from licensed liquor stores, buying drinks only from licensed bars and hotels, always checking if bottle seals are intact, and checking labels for poor print quality or incorrect spellings.",
      "The Methanol Institute notes that beverages such as canned beer, cider, wine, pre-mix, and duty-free products tend to be safer and less easy to adulterate.",
      "It also urges people to be wary of homemade brews, and free drinks or drinks priced far below normal.",

      "It's not all about heat. Mohan noted this year's Paris Olympics had to delay some triathlon events because heavy rains \u2014 which have increased as a warming atmosphere holds more water \u2014 contributed to high bacteria levels in the Seine River.",
      "Some top soccer clubs have gotten together in a climate action alliance aimed at reducing emissions and inspiring fans to act on climate change. One of those is La Liga club Real Betis.

      "FIFA President Gianni Infantino attended COP29 and posted on Instagram about extending a partnership with Pacific Island nations to foster \u201cclimate-resilient football development\u201d and raise awareness about climate change. That came just months after FIFA signed a sponsorship deal with Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco.",

      "One of the most prominent figures from Canada\u2019s trucker protests against COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 has been found guilty on five counts including mischief and disobeying a court order",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- One of the most prominent figures from Canada's trucker protests against COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 has been found guilty on five counts including mischief and disobeying a court order.",
      "A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison.",
      "Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government.",
      "Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest.",
      "The prosecution alleged King was a protest leader who was instrumental to the disruption in Ottawa. The prosecution alleged King coordinated the repeated bouts of honking, ordering the protesters to lay on the horn every 30 minutes for 10 minutes at a time, and told people to \u201chold the line\u201d when he was aware that police and the city had asked the truckers to leave.",
      "The prosecution's case relied mainly on King\u2019s own videos, which he posted to social media throughout the protest to document the demonstration and communicate with those taking part.",
      "King\u2019s lawyers argued that he was peacefully protesting and was not one of the demonstration's leaders.",
      "King was found not guilty on three counts of intimidation and one count of obstructing police himself.",
      "The truckers' convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant the honking of horns and music from parties.",
      "Trudeau's government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada.",
      "The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.",
      "The Freedom Convoy shook Canada\u2019s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was blocked. It carries more than 25% of trade between the countries, who are each other's largest trading partners."

      "A California infant has died and at least 10 other people have been sickened in an outbreak of listeria food poisoning tied to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products that include chicken feet, duck neck, beef shank and pork hock, federal health officials reported Friday.",
      "Yu Shang Food, Inc., of Spartanburg, South Carolina, has recalled more than 72,000 pounds of meat and poultry products tied to the outbreak, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Some products were initially recalled on Nov. 9.",
      "The foods were shipped to retail locations nationwide and available online, and illnesses have been reported in four states. The problem was discovered in October after routine tests detected listeria in the foods and the production environment.",
      "Of the 11 people sickened, nine were hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said. A California woman who was pregnant with twins was sickened and both infants died, the CDC said, but listeria was only found in a sample from one of the infants, so that child and the mother were included in the count but the other infant wasn't.",
      "Interviews with people who were sickened and laboratory findings pointed to the Yu Shang Food products.",
      "Although the foods have been recalled, some may still be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers. The products should be discarded or returned to the place of purchase. Refrigerators, containers and other surfaces that may have touched the foods should be cleaned and sanitized.",
      "People get sick with listeria poisoning when they eat foods contaminated with the bacteria. Symptoms can be mild and include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. More serious illness can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Listeria poisoning is tricky, because symptoms can start quickly, within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. But they also can take weeks or up to three months to show up. Those most vulnerable to getting sick include the very young, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.",
      "A different listeria outbreak tied to recalled Boar\u2019s Head deli meats has ended, CDC officials said this week. That outbreak killed 10 people this summer and sickened dozens of others.",

      "Detroit-based Wolverine Packing Co. recalled the meat this week after Minnesota state agriculture officials reported multiple illnesses and found that a sample of the product tested positive for E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening infections. The ground beef was sent to restaurants nationwide.",

      "To date, no illnesses have been reported outside of Minnesota, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. People fell ill between Nov. 2 and Nov. 14. The investigation is ongoing.",
      "E. coli is a type of bacteria found in the environment, including water, food and in the intestines of people and animals. There are many kinds of harmless E. coli, but a few types can make people seriously ill.",
      "Symptoms typically occur quickly, within a few days of eating contaminated food. They can include fever, vomiting, diarrhea \u2014 including bloody diarrhea \u2014 and signs of dehydration. The infection can cause a type of serious kidney injury, especially in kids younger than 5. People older than 65, who are pregnant or post-partum or who have weakened immune systems are also at risk.

    "summary": "Fights are cropping up nationwide over fluoride in drinking water",
    "story": [
      "Fights are cropping up nationwide over fluoride in drinking water",
      "NEW YORK -- For about 50 years, adding cavity-preventing fluoride to drinking water was a popular public health measure in Yorktown, a leafy town north of New York City.",
      "But in September, the town\u2019s supervisor used his emergency powers to stop the practice.",
      "The reason? A recent federal judge\u2019s decision that ordered U.S. regulators to consider the risk that fluoride in water could cause lower IQ in kids.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to look at and just say \u2018Ah, screw it. We\u2019ll keep going on,\u2019\u201d said the town supervisor, Ed Lachterman.",
      "Yorktown isn\u2019t alone. The decision to add fluoride to drinking water rests with state and local officials, and fights are cropping up nationwide.",
      "Communities in Florida, Texas, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and elsewhere have debated the idea in recent months \u2014 the total number is in the dozens, with several deciding to stop adding it to drinking water, according to Fluoride Action Network, an advocacy organization against water fluoridation. In Arkansas, legislators this week filed a bill to repeal the state\u2019s fluoridation program.",
      "The debates have been ignited or fueled by three developments:",
      "\u2014In August, a federal agency reported \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure \u2014 more than twice the recommended limit \u2014 and lower IQ in kids.",
      "\u2014In September, the federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to the intellectual development of children.",
      "\u2014This month, just days before the election, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared that Donald Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day as president. Trump later picked Kennedy to run the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In Durango, Colorado, there was an unsuccessful attempt to stop fluoridating the water during Trump\u2019s first term in office. A new push came this year, as Trump saw a surge of political support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of the ebb and flow of politics on the national level that ultimately affects us down here,\u201d said city spokesman Tom Sluis.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and the addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data.",
      "There is a recommended fluoridation level, but many communities exceed that, sometimes because fluoride occurs naturally at higher levels in certain water sources.",
      "Opposition is nothing new, though for decades it was considered a fringe opinion. Adherents included conspiracy theorists who claimed fluoridation was a plot to make people submissive to government power.",
      "Health officials could point to studies that showed that cavities were less common in communities with fluoridated water, and that dental health worsened in communities without it.",
      "But fluoride isn't just in water. Through the years it became common in toothpaste, mouthwash and other products. And data began to emerge that there could be too much of a good thing: In 2011, officials reported that 2 out of 5 U.S. adolescents had at least mild tooth streaking or spottiness because of too much fluoride.",
      "In 2015, the CDC recommended that communities revisit how much they were putting in the water. Beginning in 1962, the government recommended a range of 0.7 milligrams per liter for warmer climates where people drink more water to 1.2 milligrams in cooler areas. The new standard became 0.7 everywhere.",
      "Over time, more studies pointed to a different problem: a link between higher levels of fluoride and brain development. The August report by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program \u2014 summarizing studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico \u2014 concluded that drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter was associated with lower IQs in kids.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that fluoride prevents cavities,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the CDC when the agency changed the recommended fluoride levels. \u201cThere\u2019s also no question we\u2019re getting more fluoride than we were 50 years ago, through toothpaste and other things.\u201d",
      "Frieden said \u201ca legitimate question\u201d has been raised about whether fluoride affects brain development, and studies making that link \u201cneed to be looked at carefully.\u201d",
      "Many people in health care strongly embrace water fluoridation. The American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirmed their endorsement of current CDC recommendations in the wake of the federal report and the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "Colorado\u2019s health department, which weighed in during a Nov. 5 Durango city council meeting, said in a statement that it \u201cseeks to align its public health recommendations with the latest scientific research. The facts of this court ruling are not sufficient\u201d to revise current fluoridation levels.",
      "Durango officials are waiting to see what the EPA does in reaction to the recent court decision, said Sluis, the city spokesman.",
      "\u201cWe follow the science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be in the best interest of the city to stop fluoridation based on one judge\u2019s interpretation.\u201d",
      "In Yorktown, Lachterman concluded the judge\u2019s decision was enough to halt fluoridation. He recalled a community discussion several years ago in which most people in the room clearly favored fluoridation, but recently it seems public comment has reversed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a total 180,\u201d he said.",
      "But not all public pressure these days is against the idea.",
      "In September, Buffalo, New York, announced it would resume water fluoridation after not having it for nearly a decade. News reports had described an increase in tooth decay and families sued, seeking damages for dental costs.",
      "The Buffalo Sewer Authority\u2019s general manager, Oluwole McFoy declined to discuss the decision with The Associated Press, citing the litigation.",
      "For its part, the EPA \u201cis in the process of reviewing the district court\u2019s decision,\u201d spokesman Jeff Landis said this week.",
      "In Monroe, Wisconsin, fluoridation \u201chas become a very hot issue,\u201d said its mayor, Donna Douglas.",
      "The small city, near Madison, started fluoridating its drinking water in the early 1960s. But in the late summer, some residents began calling and emailing Douglas, saying she needed to do something about what they saw as a public health danger. The first call \u201cwas more like a threat,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Douglas said she did not take a position on whether to stop, but decided to raise it to the city council for discussion. The discussions were unusually emotional.",
      "Few people tend to speak during public comment sessions at council meetings, said Douglas. But more than two dozen people spoke at a city council meeting last month, most of them in favor of fluoridation. At a subsequent meeting, about a dozen more people \u2014 all opposed to fluoridation \u2014 came out to speak.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had any debates at all\u201d like this, Douglas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would be such a heated discussion.\u201d",

      "In a letter first reported by ProPublica and dated Nov. 8, state public health commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said whoever shared the information violated state law and a confidential agreement signed by committee members. An agency investigation wasn't able to identify who disclosed the details.",
      "ProPublica reported in September that internal reports showed the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review Committee determined the deaths of two women were preventable, but found that doctors were hesitant to perform a procedure that could have saved their lives because of the state's strict abortion policies.",
      "The cases drew national attention and became a central theme in Vice President Kamala Harris ' presidential campaign. Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision more than two years ago that overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "The Georgia committee works to identify what caused women to die during pregnancy or soon after childbirth, seeking to prevent other deaths or health crises.",
      "The decision to disband the committee seems \u201cvery abrupt,\u201d said Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, one of the groups that sued Georgia over the state's abortion ban beyond six weeks of pregnancy. A judge initially struck down the ban, but Georgia's Supreme Court halted the ruling in October, restoring the law.",
      "\"To have any time where we don\u2019t have this committee in place difficult to fathom, realizing that we may lose access to really important data and information that could help us make better decisions and organize better around what we need for the state,\" Simpson said.",

      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp doesn't appoint or release members of the committee because it's overseen by the Department of Public Health, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said. Kemp signed into law in 2019 a ban on abortions once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.",

    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",

      "Mexico has been taking a bashing for allegedly serving as a conduit for Chinese parts and products into North America",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico has been taking a bashing lately for allegedly serving as a conduit for Chinese parts and products into North America, and officials here are afraid a re-elected Donald Trump or politically struggling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could try to leave their country out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.",
      "Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party is so afraid of losing the trade deal that President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday the government has gone on a campaign to get companies to replace Chinese parts with locally made ones.",
      "\u201cWe have a plan with the aim of substituting these imports that come from China, and producing the majority of them in Mexico, either with Mexican companies or primarily North American companies,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "While Sheinbaum claimed Mexico had been working on that effort since t he 2021 global supply chain crisis \u2014 when factories around the world were stalled by a lack of parts and particularly computer chips from Asia \u2014 it appears to be an uphill battle. Even the United States has faced big challenges in moving chip production back home despite billions in subsidies and incentives.",
      "Mexico gained tens of thousands of jobs when U.S. and foreign automakers moved their plants to Mexico under the free trade pact to take advantage of much lower wages. But the idea that Chinese parts \u2014 or even whole cars \u2014 could be piggybacking on that arrangement to further hollow out the U.S. auto industry has enraged some people north of the border.",
      "So Mexico is scrambling with private companies to get them to move parts production here.",
      "\u201cNext year, God willing, we are going to start making microchips in Mexico,\u201d Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday. \u201cOf course they're not yet the most advanced chips, but we are going to start producing them here.\u201d",
      "Mexico's nationalistic ruling party, which is normally very resistant to being seen as bending to U.S. demands, is scrambling in other ways, too.",
      "The ruling party is in the process of eliminating a half-dozen independent regulatory and oversight agencies that were established by former presidents. That includes the anti-monopoly, transparency and energy regulatory bodies. Together with reforms that will make all judges stand for election in Mexico, that has sparked concern in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "Countries are required under the agreement to have some independent agencies, in part to protect foreign investors. For example, they could prevent a government from approving a monopoly for a state-owned company that could force competitors out of the market.",
      "So ruling-party legislators are actually re-writing the proposed laws to exactly mimic the minimum accepted requirements under the trade accord.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done is to create a reform so that its almost exactly equal to what exists in the United States, so we can clear that up,\u201d Ebrard said.",
      "It's all part of a very legalistic defense of the trade accord, signed in 2018 and approved in 2019. Mexico hopes the rules of the agreement would prevent the U.S. or Canada from simply walking away when the trade pact comes up for review in 2026. Experts agree, saying that totally abandoning the accord is unlikely.",
      "Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base notes that if a country is dissatisfied with the trade agreement during the periodic reviews, like in 2026, there is a clause in the pact that says they can ask for a review each year to work out a solution, and keep doing that for a decade while the agreement remains in force.",
      "\u201cThat is, they wouldn't be able to get out until 2036,\u201d Siller said. \u201cI think they will play hardball with Mexico in the 2026 review.\u201d",
      "Like any marriage, when the pact no longer works for one party, it may still drag on for years but it\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.",
      "C.J. Mahoney. who served as deputy U.S. trade representative in Trump's first administration, said in a talk for the Texas-based Baker Institute in September that the United States probably wouldn't end the trade agreement. But with growingly vocal critics of the pact it could hold up renewing it for years.",
      "\u201cThe costs of not renewing immediately are actually quite relatively low,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cI think the inclination to just kick the can down the road will be pretty strong.\u201d",
      "Because many companies won't make big investments in production facilities without certainty, that could be a serious if not fatal blow to the pact.",
      "How much does Mexico actually buy from China? Mexican officials say they have fewer imports of Chinese parts and products than the United States does. But given the enormous size difference between the two countries' economies, it is a true but weak argument.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Mexico that were made elsewhere, in an attempt to stop China from avoiding import taxes by routing goods through Mexico. It includes a 25% tariff on steel not melted or poured in Mexico and a 10% tariff on aluminum.",
      "Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, has called for stopping Mexican steel imports, saying \u201cthe alarming rise in Chinese steel and aluminum coming into the country through Mexico ... is unsustainable and a threat to American jobs, as well as our economy and national security.\"",
      "In the end, Mexico may be forced to crack down on Chinese imports, but it won't be easy.",
      "\u201cReducing the dependence on Chinese imports is not going to be achieved in the short or medium term,\" said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ramos, a professor of public administration at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana."

      "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- The first woman to command Canada's military called out a U.S. senator on Saturday for questioning the role of women in combat.",
      "Gen. Jennie Carignan responded to comments made by Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was asked on Friday whether President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, should retract comments that he believes men and women should not serve together in combat units.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s delusional for anybody to not agree that women in combat creates certain unique situations that have to be dealt with. I think the jury\u2019s still out on how to do that,\" Risch said during a panel session at the Halifax International Security Forum on Friday.",
      "Carignan, Canada's chief of defense staff and the first woman to command the armed forces of any Group of 20 or Group of Seven country, took issue with those remarks during a panel session on Saturday.",
      "\"If you\u2019ll allow me, I would first like maybe to respond to Senator Risch\u2019s statement yesterday about women in combat because I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to leave this forum with this idea that women are a distraction to defense and national security,\" Carignan said.",
      "\u201cAfter 39 years of career as a combat arms officer and risking my life in many operations across the world, I can\u2019t believe that in 2024, we still have to justify the contribution of women to their defense and to their service, in their country. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to leave this forum with this idea that this is that it is some kind of social experiment.\u201d",
      "Carignan said women have participating in combat for hundreds of years but have never been recognized for fighting for their country. She noted the women military personnel in the room.",
      "\u201cAll the women sitting here in uniform, stepping in, and deciding to get into harm\u2019s way and fight for their country, need to be recognized for doing so,\" she said. \u201cSo again, this is the distraction, not the women themselves.\"",
      "Carignan received a standing ovation at the forum, which attracts defense and security officials from Western democracies.",
      "Hegseth has reignited a debate that many thought had been long settled: Should women be allowed to serve their country by fighting on the front lines?",
      "The former Fox News commentator made it clear, in his own book and in interviews, that he believes men and women should not serve together in combat units. If Hegseth is confirmed by the Senate, he could try to end the Pentagon\u2019s nearly decade-old practice of making all combat jobs open to women.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s remarks have generated a barrage of praise and condemnation.",
      "Carignan was promoted to the rank of general during the change-of-command ceremony this past summer, after being chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government to become Canada\u2019s first female defense chief.",
      "Carignan is no stranger to firsts. She was also the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria.",
      "For the last three years, she has been the chief of professional conduct and culture, a job created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021.",
      "Her appointment this year comes as Canada continues to face criticism from NATO allies for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. The Canadian government recently said that it would reach its NATO commitment by 2032.",
      "Risch said Friday Trump would laugh at Canada\u2019s current military spending plans and said the country must do more."

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- This past week has seen the most significant escalation in hostilities that Ukraine has witnessed since Russia's full-scale invasion and marks a new chapter in the nearly three-year war \u2014 one tinged with uncertainty and fear.",
      "It began with U.S. President Joe Biden reversing a longstanding policy by granting Kyiv permission to deploy American longer-range missiles inside Russian territory and ended with Moscow striking Ukraine with a new experimental ballistic weapon that has alarmed the international community and heightened fears of further escalation.",
      "Here is a look at the events in Ukraine in the span of a week that has fundamentally altered the stakes of the war:",
      "Washington eased limits on what Ukraine can strike with its American-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, after months of ruling out such a move over fears of escalating the conflict and bringing about a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.",
      "The change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said North Korean troops were inside Russia and being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops from Russia\u2019s Kursk region. But the scope of the new firing guidelines wasn\u2019t clear.",
      "The Kremlin warned that Biden\u2019s decision would escalate international tensions even higher.",
      "\u201cIt is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "Ukraine fired several ATACMS, striking an ammunition warehouse in Russia\u2019s Bryansk region, the first time Kyiv had used the weapons inside enemy territory, according to widespread reports. Ukrainian officials have not officially confirmed the strikes which occurred on the 1,000th day since the invasion.",
      "Also Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons, opening the door to a potential nuclear response by Moscow to even a conventional attack by any nation supported by a nuclear power. That could include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S.",
      "In the second major shift in U.S. policy, the Biden administration announced it will give Ukraine antipersonnel mines to help slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances. Biden had previously put off signing off on this because of international objections to the use of such mines due to the risks they pose to civilians. Russia deploys them freely.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the shift in Washington\u2019s policy was needed to counter changing Russian tactics.",

      "The U.S. and some other Western embassies in Kyiv temporarily closed in response to the threat of a potentially major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital.",
      "The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine in response to Kyiv\u2019s use of American and British missiles, Putin said.",
      "In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at 10 times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik \u2014 Russian for hazelnut tree \u2014 based on Russia\u2019s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, which can carry nuclear warheads.",
      "Putin also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. Moscow gave Washington a 30-minute warning of the attack, which struck a weapons factory in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.",
      "NATO and Ukraine scheduled emergency talks slated for Tuesday, the alliance said. The meeting will be held at the request of Ukraine and will convene at the level of ambassadors.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s parliament also canceled a session as security was tightened in the city. Lawmakers said there was a credible threat of an attack on government buildings.",

      "Japan held a memorial ceremony near the Sado Island Gold Mines, listed this summer as a UNESCO World Heritage site after the country moved past years of disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the dark side of their history",
      "SADO, Japan -- Japan held a memorial ceremony on Sunday near the Sado Island Gold Mines, listed this summer as a UNESCO World Heritage site after the country moved past years of historical disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the mines' dark history. However, it has not offered an apology.",
      "At these mines, hundreds of Koreans were forced to labor under abusive and brutal conditions during World War II, historians say. Japanese officials at Sunday\u2019s ceremony time paid tribute for the first to \u201call workers\u201d including Korean laborers who died at the mines, without acknowledging they were forced laborers \u2014 part of what critics call a persistent policy of whitewashing Japan's history of sexual and labor exploitation before and during the war.",
      "The ceremony, supposed to further mend wounds, renewed tensions between the two sides. South Korea boycotted Sunday's memorial service citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo over the event.",
      "\u201cAs a resident, I must say (their absence) is very disappointing after all the preparations we made,\u201d said Sado Mayor Ryugo Watanabe. \u201cI wish we could have held the memorial with South Korean attendees.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press explains the Sado mines, their history and the controversy.",
      "The 16th-century mines on the island of Sado, about the size of the Pacific island of Guam, off the western coast of Niigata prefecture, operated for nearly 400 years, beginning in 1601, and were once the world\u2019s largest gold producer. They closed in 1989. During the Edo period, from 1603 to 1868, the mines supplied gold currency to the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate.",
      "Today, the site has been developed into a tourist facility and hiking site where visitors can learn about the changes in mining technology and production methods while looking at the remains of mine shafts and ore dressing facilities.",
      "Critics say the Japanese government only highlights the glory of the mines and covers up its use of Korean victims of forced labor and their ordeals. The mines were registered as a cultural heritage site in July after Japan agreed to include an exhibit on the conditions of Korean forced laborers and to hold a memorial service annually after repeated protests from the South Korean government.",
      "A few signs have since been erected, indicating former sites of South Korean laborers\u2019 dormitories. A city-operated museum in the area also added a section about Korean laborers, but a private museum attached to the main UNESCO site doesn't mention them at all.",
      "At the UNESCO World Heritage Committee July meeting, the Japanese delegate said Tokyo had installed new exhibition material to explain the \u201csevere conditions of (the Korean laborers\u2019) work and to remember their hardship.\u201d",
      "Japan also acknowledged that Koreans were made to do more dangerous tasks in the mine shaft, which caused some to die. Those who survived also developed lung diseases and other health problems. Many of them were given meager food rations and nearly no days off and were caught by police if they escaped, historians say. But the Japanese government has refused to admit they were \u201cforced labor.\u201d",
      "South Korea had earlier opposed the listing of the site for UNESCO World Heritage on the grounds that the Korean forced laborers used at the mines were missing from the exhibition. South Korea eventually supported the listing after consultations with Japan and Tokyo\u2019s pledge to improve the historical background of the exhibit and to hold a memorial that also includes Koreans.",
      "Historians say Japan used hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific. About 1,500 Koreans were forced to work at the Sado mines, according to Yasuto Takeuchi, an expert on Japan\u2019s wartime history, citing wartime Japanese documents.",
      "The South Korean government has said it expects Japan to keep its pledge to be truthful to history and to show both sides of the Sado mines.",
      "\u201cThe controversy surrounding the Sado mines exhibit underscores a deeper problem\u201d of Japan\u2019s failure to face up to its wartime responsibility and its growing \u201cdenialism\u201d of its wartime atrocities, Takeuchi said.",
      "All workers who died at the Sado mines were honored. That includes hundreds of Korean laborers who worked there during Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.",
      "At Sunday\u2019s ceremony, four Japanese representatives, including central and local government officials and the head of the organizing group, thanked all mine workers for their sacrifice and mourned for those who died. None offered any apology to Korean forced laborers for the harsh treatment at the mines.",
      "Attendants observed a moment of silence for the victims who died at the mines due to accidents and other causes.",
      "The ceremony dredged up long-standing frustrations in South Korea.",
      "About 100 people, including officials from Japan\u2019s local and central government, as well as South Korean Foreign Ministry officials and the relatives of Korean wartime laborers, were supposed to attend. Because of South Korea's last-minute boycott, more than 20 seats remained vacant.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said in a statement Saturday it was impossible to settle the disagreements between both governments before the planned event on Sunday, without specifying what those disagreements were.",
      "There has been speculation that the South Korean boycott might have been due to the presence of parliamentary vice minister Akiko Ikuina at Sunday's ceremony. In August 2022, Ikuina reportedly visited Tokyo\u2019s controversial Yasukuni Shrine, weeks after she was elected as a lawmaker. Japan\u2019s neighbors view Yasukuni, which commemorates 2.5 million war dead including war criminals, as a symbol of Japan\u2019s past militarism. Her visit could have been seen as a sign of a lack of remorse.",
      "Some South Koreans criticized the Seoul government for throwing its support behind an event without securing a clear Japanese commitment to highlight the plight of Korean laborers. There were also complaints over South Korea agreeing to pay for the travel expenses of Korean victims\u2019 family members who were invited to attend the ceremony.",
      "Critics say Japan\u2019s government has long been reluctant to discuss wartime atrocities. That includes what historians describe as the sexual abuse and enslavement of women across Asia, many of them Koreans who were deceived into providing sex to Japanese soldiers at frontline brothels and euphemistically called \u201ccomfort women,\u201d and the Koreans who were mobilized and forced to work in Japan, especially in the final years of World War II.",
      "Korean compensation demands for Japanese atrocities during its brutal colonial rule have strained relations between the two Asian neighbors, most recently after a 2018 South Korean Supreme Court ruling ordered Japanese companies to pay damages over their wartime forced labor.",
      "Japan\u2019s government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under the 1965 normalization treaty. Ties between Tokyo and Seoul have improved recently after Washington said their disputes over historical issues hampered crucial security cooperation as China\u2019s threat grows in the region.",
      "South Korea\u2019s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol announced in March 2023 that his country would use a local corporate fund to compensate forced labor victims without demanding Japanese contributions. Japan\u2019s then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida later expressed sympathy for their suffering during a Seoul visit. Security, business and other ties between the sides have since rapidly resumed.",
      "Japan\u2019s whitewashing of wartime atrocities has risen since the 2010s, particularly under the past government of revisionist leader Shinzo Abe. For instance, Japan says the terms \u201csex slavery\u201d and \u201cforced labor\u201d are inaccurate and insists on the use of highly euphemistic terms such as \u201ccomfort women\u201d and \u201ccivilian workers\u201d instead.",
      "Takeuchi, the historian, said listing Japan\u2019s modern industrial historical sites as a UNESCO World Heritage is a government push to increase tourism. The government, he said, wants \u201cto commercialize sites like the Sado mines by beautifying and justifying their history for Japan\u2019s convenience.\u201d",

      "But Borrell later said that he did not \u201csee the Israeli government interested clearly in reaching an agreement for a cease-fire\" and that it seemed Israel was seeking new conditions. He pointed to Israel\u2019s refusal to accept France as a member of the international committee that would oversee the cease-fire's implementation.",
      "The emerging agreement would pave the way for the withdrawal of Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops from southern Lebanon below the Litani River in accordance with the U.N.

      "BERLIN -- American photographer and activist Nan Goldin has used a speech at the opening of her exhibition in Germany to condemn Israel's war in Gaza.",
      "Goldin, 71, said Friday she wanted to use her retrospective show at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin \u201cas a platform to amplify my position of moral outrage\" at what she described as \"genocide in Gaza and Lebanon.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy grandparents escaped pogroms in Russia. I was brought up knowing about the Nazi Holocaust. What I see in Gaza reminds me of the pogroms that my grandparents escaped,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Goldin, who is of Jewish origin, was born in Washington D.C. and is a leading artist and activist whose life and work was documented in the award-winning 2022 film \u201cAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed.\"",
      "She spoke of the displacement and destruction in Gaza, and told a cheering audience that criticism of Israel should not be conflated with antisemitism.",
      "Goldin also criticized Germany and alleged that Islamophobia was being ignored in the country. \u201cGermany is home of the largest Palestinian diaspora in Europe. Yet protests are met with police dogs and deportation and stigmatization,\u201d she said.",
      "Goldin walked off the stage to loud chants of \u201cfree, free Palestine,\" which drowned out a subsequent speech by the director of the gallery, Klaus Biesenbach.",
      "Hermann Parzinger, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, to which the Neue Nationalgalerie belongs, sharply condemned Goldin\u2019s talk and the protesters' disruption of Biesenbach's speech.",
      "\u201cThis does not correspond to our understanding of freedom of expression,\u201d he said.",
      "Biesenbach noted that he disagreed with Goldin but affirmed her right to freely express herself.",
      "In a statement released by Biesenbach after the show's opening, cited by German news agency dpa, he said the gallery distanced itself from the protesters' stance and \"clarifies that it stands for freedom of expression and respectful dialogue and interaction with each other.\u201d",
      "Neue Nationalgalerie\u2019s lifetime retrospective of Goldin, titled \u201cThis Will Not End Well,\u201d showcases a comprehensive overview of Goldin\u2019s work, including slideshows and films backed up by music.",

The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced.",

      "The activists have documented an increase in illegal deforestation within the Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park, located near an economic land concession, it said.",
      "The arrests come during a broader crackdown on environmental activists in recent months. In July, 10 members of a Cambodian environmental group, Mother Nature Cambodia, who campaigned against destructive infrastructure projects and alleged corruption were each sentenced to six years in prison on charges of conspiring against the state.",
      "Stung Treng provincial spokesman Men Khung confirmed Sunday by telephone that the six were arrested after they ignored instructions from authorities to leave the forestry area where no access is allowed. He said authorities were strictly guarding the site against illegal logging and land grabbing.",
      "Men Khung said several dozen armed personnel have been sent to the site to chase away illegal loggers and land grabbers and to ensure that no outsiders enter. He said that the six were not environmental activists but attempted to sow anarchy and provoke the authorities.",
      "He said that no charges had been filed against the six as of Sunday.",
      "According to Licadho, the government granted an economic land concession in the area in 2022, even though it contravened a 2012 moratorium on new concessions, which have been linked to mass evictions, rapid deforestation and extraction of resources.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s government has long been accused of using its judiciary to persecute critics and political opponents. Prime Minister Hun Manet succeeded his father, Hun Sen, in August last year after he ruled the country for nearly four decades, but there have been few signs of political liberalization."

      "Pope Francis will travel to the Mediterranean island of Corsica on Dec. 15",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis will travel to the Mediterranean island of Corsica on Dec. 15, making yet another visit to France that avoids the capital and all the pomp and protocol that accompanies a proper state visit.",
      "The one-day visit to the French island region, confirmed Saturday by the Vatican, is to close out a diocesan conference on popular piety in Ajaccio, the capital.",
      "While Francis will meet with President Emmanuel Macron at the airport before returning to Rome, the trip is in some way a snub of the French leader who had invited Francis to travel to Paris the previous weekend to preside over the grand reopening of Notre Dame.",
      "Francis made clear in September that he wouldn\u2019t participate in the ceremony, telling reporters flat-out \u201cI won\u2019t go to Paris,\u201d after a French publication reported that he would attend the Dec. 8 reopening of the cathedral after the devastating 2019 fire.",
      "Francis subsequently announced a busy Vatican agenda for that weekend, presiding over a consistory to create new cardinals Dec. 7 and participating in his annual commemoration of the Dec. 8 feast day dedicated to the Virgin Mary.",
      "The Dec. 15 event in Corsica seems far more suited to Francis\u2019 priorities than a grand cathedral reopening, emphasizing the \u201cchurch of the peripheries.\u201d He will close out a Corsican church conference on \u201cpopular piety in the Mediterranean.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a similar theme that brought Francis to the southern French port of Marseille in 2023, when he made an overnight visit to participate in an annual summit of Mediterranean bishops. His previous trip to France was at the start of his pontificate, when he made a one-day visit to Strasbourg on Nov. 25, 2014, to address the European Parliament and Council of Europe.",
      "Corsica is home to more than 340,000 people and has been part of France since 1768. But the island has also seen pro-independence violence and has an influential nationalist movement, and last year Macron proposed granting it limited autonomy.",
      "Francis has stressed that he wants to prioritize smaller Catholic communities on the peripheries rather than the big centers of Christianity. As a result, his foreign trips have tended to avoid major European capitals in favor of far-flung churches in poorer parts of the world.",

      "The Broad Front oversaw the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and the sale of marijuana in the small South American nation of 3.4 million people.",
      "Orsi's Broad Front took 44% of the vote while Delgado's National Party won 27% in the first round of voting Oct. 27. But other conservative parties that make up the government coalition \u2014 in particular, the Colorado Party \u2014 notched 20% of the vote collectively, enough to give Delgado an edge over his challenger.",
      "Congress ended up evenly split in the October vote. Most polls have shown a virtual tie between Delgado and Orsi, with nearly 10% of Uruguayan voters undecided even at this late stage. Many said they believed turnout would be low if voting weren't compulsory in the country.",
      "\u201cNeither candidate convinced me and I feel that there are many in my same situation,\" said Vanesa Gelezoglo, 31, in the capital, Montevideo, adding she would make up her mind at \u201cthe last minute.\u201d",
      "Analysts say the candidates' lackluster campaigns and broad consensus on key issues have generated extraordinary indecision and apathy in an election dominated by discussions about social spending and concerns over income inequality but largely free of the anti-establishment rage that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe question of whether Frente Amplio (the Broad Front) raises taxes is not an existential question, unlike what we saw in the U.S. with Trump and Kamala framing each other as threats to democracy,\" said Nicol\u00e1s Sald\u00edas, a Latin America and Caribbean senior analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cThat doesn't exist in Uruguay.\u201d",
      "Both candidates are also appealing to voter angst over a surge in violent crime that has shaken a nation long regarded as one of the region\u2019s safest, with Delgado promising tough-on-crime policies and Orsi advocating a more community-oriented approach.",
      "Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, campaigned on a vow to continue the legacy of current President Lacalle Pou \u2014 in some ways making the election into a referendum on his leadership. He campaigned under the slogan \u201cre-elect a good government.\"",
      "While a string of corruption scandals rattled Lacalle Pou's government last year, the president \u2014 who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term \u2014 now enjoys high approval ratings and a strong economy expected to grow 3.2% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Inflation has also eased in recent months, boosting his coalition.",
      "Delgado served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and promises to pursue his predecessor's pro-business policies. He would continue pushing for a trade deal with China that has raised hackles in Mercosur, an alliance of South American countries promoting regional commerce.",
      "\"We have to give the government coalition a chance to consolidate its proposals,\u201d said Ramiro P\u00e9rez, a street vendor voting for Delgado on Sunday.",
      "Orsi, 57, a former history teacher and two-time mayor from a working-class background, is widely seen as the political heir to iconic former President Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who raised Uruguay's international profile as one of the region's most socially liberal and environmentally sustainable nations during his 2010-2015 term.",
      "\u201cHe's my candidate, not only for my sake but also for my children's,\u201d Yeny Varone, a nurse, said of Orsi. \u201cIn the future they'll have better working conditions, health and salaries.\u201d",
      "Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, was among the first to cast his ballot after polls opened.",
      "\u201cUruguay is a small country, but it has earned recognition for being stable, for having a citizenry that respects institutional formalities,\u201d he told reporters from his local polling station. \u201cThis is no small feat.\u201d",
      "While promising to forge a \u201cnew left\u201d in Uruguay, Orsi plans no dramatic changes. He proposes tax incentives to lure investment and social security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay's unions.",
      "The contentious plebiscite on whether to boost pension payouts failed to pass in October, with Uruguayans rejecting generous pensions in favor of fiscal constraint.",
      "Both candidates pledged full cooperation with each other if elected.",
      "\u201cI want (Orsi) to know that my idea is to form a government of national unity,\u201d Delgado told reporters after casting his vote in the capital's upscale Pocitos neighborhood. He said that if he won, he and Orsi would chat on Monday over some yerba mate, the traditional herbal drink beloved by Uruguayans.",
      "Orsi similarly pledged a smooth and respectful transition of power, describing Sunday's democratic exercise as \u201can incredible experience\" as he voted in Canelones, the sprawling town of beaches and cattle ranches just north of Montevideo where he served as mayor for a decade.",
      "\u201cThe essence of politics is agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never end up completely satisfied.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:10:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Nigeria faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation after the government ended costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa&rsquo;s most populous country",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation after the government ended costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa\u2019s most populous country",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- When Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu ended the costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa's most populous country, Ahmed Halilu knew his e-hailing cab business in the capital, Abuja, was about to run into huge losses.",
      "Transportation costs skyrocketed as the price of petrol more than tripled in the months that followed last year's decision, resulting in the country\u2019s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. That meant a massive drop in the number of Halilu's passengers and ultimately in his earnings.",
      "In what they said would eventually lower transportation costs by almost 50%, Nigerian authorities in August introduced a compressed natural gas (CNG) initiative to tap its huge gas reserves \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest \u2014 and roll out CNG buses while switching petrol-powered vehicles to use it.",
      "More than 100,000 vehicles have been adapted to run on CNG or with the hybrid option of CNG and petrol, and at least $200 million has been invested by the government under the initiative, according to its director, Michael Oluwagbemi.",
      "The government aims to convert 1 million of Nigeria's over 11 million vehicles in the next three years, but analysts say the process has been slow, pointing to poor implementation and limited infrastructure.",
      "Although Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s top oil producers, it depends on imported refined petroleum products because its refineries are struggling, with production at its lowest in decades amid massive oil theft.",
      "Together with other reforms introduced by Tinubu after coming to power in May last year, the removal of subsidies was supposed to save the government money and shore up dwindling foreign investments.",
      "However, it has affected the price of just about everything, and soaring transportation costs force people to abandon their vehicles and walk to work.",
      "Switching over to gas is hard. In addition to the lack of an adequate network of CNG conversion and filling stations \u2014 available in 13 of Nigeria's 36 states \u2014 the success of the government's initiative also has been limited by low public awareness.",
      "That has left room for misinformation and hesitancy among drivers.",
      "\u201cPeople are not keen about it because of a lack of orientation,\" Halilu said. He converted his vehicle and now saves $240 monthly on petrol costs in his e-hailing business.",
      "Some drivers have expressed fear that their cars could explode with the CNG conversion \u2014 claims that regulatory agencies have said are untrue unless the equipment is installed inappropriately. In southern Edo state, authorities found that a CNG-powered vehicle that exploded had been worked on by an unaccredited vendor.",
      "Even in Abuja and the economic hub of Lagos, filling stations are scarce and the few available conversion workshops are often lined with commercial vehicles waiting for days to switch to CNG at subsidized rates.",
      "Meanwhile, the cost for private vehicles to switch is 20 times Nigeria\u2019s minimum monthly wage of $42.",
      "A colleague had to travel about 200 kilometers (124 miles) to Abuja to refill his cylinder, said Abdul Manasseh, an e-hailing taxi driver in Abuja.",
      "Another challenge that has slowed the initiative is Nigeria\u2019s limited gas pipeline, which makes supplying stations difficult. As a result, most parts of the northern and eastern states have not been reached.",
      "The challenges echo those for the shift to electric vehicles in Nigeria, where the adoption by private operators has been slow. The power supply remains fitful for most of the country\u2019s 210 million citizens, mainly as a result of underinvestment and vandalism.",
      "The government understands there is still \u201ca lot of uncertainty\u201d around the CNG initiative and is working to correct the misconceptions and provide the needed infrastructure, said Tosin Coker, the initiative's head of commercial matters.",
      "\u201cCNG is a cleaner fuel, it is a cheaper fuel and it is a safer fuel compared to the petrol that we are used to,\" Coker said. \u201cSo you will have more money in your pocket and it's cleaner for the environment.\u201d",

    "summary": "Japan has held a memorial ceremony near the Sado Island Gold Mines despite a last-minute boycott of the event by South Korea that highlighted tensions between the neighbors over the brutal wartime use of Korean laborers",
    "story": [
      "Japan has held a memorial ceremony near the Sado Island Gold Mines despite a last-minute boycott of the event by South Korea that highlighted tensions between the neighbors over the brutal wartime use of Korean laborers",
      "SADO, Japan -- Japanese officials on Sunday paid tribute to workers at the country's Sado Island Gold Mines but offered no apology over Japan\u2019s brutal wartime use of Korean forced laborers, highlighting lingering tensions between the neighbors over the issue.",
      "South Korea a day earlier announced that it was boycotting the memorial, saying it had been impossible to settle unspecified disagreements between both governments in time for the event. The Korean absence is a major setback in the rapidly improving ties between the two countries, which since last year have set aside their historical disputes to prioritize U.S.-led security cooperation.",
      "The Sado mines were listed in July as a UNESCO World Heritage Site after Japan moved past years of disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the mines\u2019 dark history, promising to hold an annual memorial service for all victims, including hundreds of Koreans who were mobilized to work in the mines.",
      "The first ceremony of what Japan has promised will be an annual event held at a facility near the mines took place with more than 20 seats for South Korean attendees empty.",
      "\u201cAs a local resident, I must say (their absence) is very disappointing after all the preparations we made,\u201d said Sado Mayor Ryugo Watanabe. \u201cI wish we could have held the memorial with South Korean attendees.\u201d",
      "Families of Korean victims of mine accidents and South Korean officials are expected to hold their own ceremony near the mine on Monday as an expression of their \u201cfirm resolve not to make a compromise with Japan on history issues,\u201d South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It said South korea will continue to strive to achieve the improvement of bilateral ties in a way that serves national interests of both countries.",
      "At Sunday's ceremony, four Japanese representatives, including central and local government officials and the head of the organizing group, thanked all mine workers for their sacrifice and mourned for those who died. None offered any apology to Korean forced laborers for the harsh treatment at the mines.",
      "Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister, representing Japan's government, praised the craftsmanship of the laborers and their contribution to the Sado mines.",
      "She noted that \u201cmany people from the Korean Peninsula were at the mines under Japan's wartime labor policies\" and that they engaged in difficult work under dangerous and severe conditions away from home and their loved ones, and some died in accidents or from illnesses. But she did not acknowledge their forced labor or Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula.",
      "There has been speculation that the South Korean boycott might have been because of Ikuina's past visit to Tokyo\u2019s controversial Yasukuni Shrine \u2014 in August 2022, weeks after she was elected as a lawmaker. Japan\u2019s neighbors view Yasukuni, which commemorates 2.5 million war dead including war criminals, as a symbol of Japan\u2019s past militarism.",
      "Ikuina belonged to a Japanese ruling party faction of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who led the whitewashing of Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities in the 2010s during his leadership.",
      "For instance, Japan says the terms \u201csex slavery\u201d and \u201cforced labor\u201d are inaccurate and insists on the use of highly euphemistic terms such as \u201ccomfort women\u201d and \u201ccivilian workers\u201d instead.",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said Saturday that Ikuina\u2019s Yasukuni visit was an issue of contention between the countries\u2019 diplomats.",
      "The 16th-century mines on the island of Sado, off Japan\u2019s north-central coast, operated for nearly 400 years before closing in 1989 and were once the world\u2019s largest gold producer.",
      "Historians say about 1,500 Koreans were mobilized to Sado as part of Japan\u2019s use of hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific.",
      "Japan\u2019s government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under a 1965 normalization treaty.",
      "South Korea had long opposed the listing of the site as World Heritage on the grounds that the Korean forced laborers, despite their key role in the wartime mine production, were missing from the exhibition. Seoul's backing for Sado came as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol prioritized improving relations with Japan.",
      "Some South Koreans had criticized Yoon\u2019s government for supporting the event without securing a clear Japanese commitment to highlight the plight of Korean laborers. There were also complaints over South Korea agreeing to pay for the travel expenses of Korean victims\u2019 family members to Sado.",

      "The president of Cyprus says Moody\u2019s two-notch credit ratings upgrade to A3 from Baa2 will open the threshold to quality foreign investment that will generate new jobs",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Moody\u2019s two-notch upgrade of Cyprus' credit rating to A3 from Baa2 opens the threshold to quality foreign investment that will generate new jobs, the president said Saturday.",
      "President Nikos Christodoulides said in a statement that the rating agency\u2019s action reflects his government\u2019s efforts at cementing Cyprus\u2019 reputation as a credible investment destination through disciplined fiscal policy, banking sector stability and financial reform.",
      "Finance Minister Makis Keravnos said the upgrade marks the first time that Moody\u2019s has elevated Cyprus back into the upper medium grade investment category since 2011, when a brewing financial crisis brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy that required a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund two years later.",
      "Moody\u2019s said its rationale for the ratings upgrade and stable outlook was grounded in Cyprus\u2019 \u201cprudent fiscal policy\u201d that combined spending cuts with strong public revenue growth, resulting in fiscal surpluses over the last two years.",
      "The agency said smaller fiscal surpluses are expected to continue until 2028, while a drop in public debt \u201chas been one of the most substantial globally,\u201d dropping from 113.6% of gross domestic product in 2020 to 73% in 2023.",
      "According to Moody\u2019s, debt is forecast to continue dropping to 50% in 2027, while the economy will grow by an average of 3.2% between 2024 and 2028, thanks to continued growth in sectors including information and communication technology, finance and insurance.",
      "Companies are opting to set up their headquarters in Cyprus, particularly from Ukraine, Israel and the Middle East. Foreign investment in energy, education, construction, health care and tourism will also buoy economic growth over the medium term.",
      "Moody\u2019s said downside risks include cancellation of large investment project, a burgeoning public sector wage bill and spending pressures in health care."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the House of Representatives speaker if she herself is killed, in a brazen public threat that she warned was not a joke.",
      "Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin referred the \u201cactive threat\u201d against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to an elite presidential guards force \u201cfor immediate proper action.\u201d It was not immediately clear what actions would be taken against the vice president.",
      "The Presidential Security Command boosted Marcos' security and said it considered the vice president's threat, which was \u201cmade so brazenly in public,\u201d a national security issue.",
      "The presidential security force said it was \u201ccoordinating with law enforcement agencies to detect, deter, and defend against any and all threats to the president and the first family.\u201d",
      "Duterte, a lawyer, later tried to walk back her remarks and said they were not an actual threat but only an expression of concern over an unspecified threat to her own life.",
      "\u201cIf I expressed the concern, they will say that\u2019s a threat to the life of the president?\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhy would I kill him if not for revenge from the grave? There is no reason for me to kill him. What's the benefit for me?\u201d Duterte told journalists.",
      "Under the Philippine penal code, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or his family and is punishable by a jail term and fine.",
      "The Philippine Constitution says that if a president dies, sustains a permanent disability, is removed from office or resigns, the vice president takes over and serves the rest of the term.",
      "Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in the May 2022 elections and both won with landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity.",
      "The two leaders and their camps, however, rapidly had a bitter falling-out over key differences, including in their approaches to China\u2019s aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body.",
      "Like her equally outspoken father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president\u2019s ally and cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its close supporters.",
      "Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a women\u2019s prison.",
      "In a pre-dawn online news conference, an angry Sara Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as a president and of being a liar, along with his wife and the House speaker in expletives-laden remarks.",
      "When asked about concerns over her security, the 46-year-old suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my security because I\u2019ve talked with somebody. I said 'if I\u2019m killed, you\u2019ll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez.

      "The former president denied authorizing extrajudicial killings under his crackdown but has given conflicting statements.

      "In a sprawling secondhand clothing market in Ghana\u2019s capital, early morning shoppers jostle as they search through piles of garments, eager to pluck a bargain or a designer find from the stalls selling used apparel from the West",
      "ACCRA, Ghana -- In a sprawling secondhand clothing market in Ghana\u2019s capital, early morning shoppers jostle as they search through piles of garments, eager to pluck a bargain or a designer find from the stalls selling used and low-quality apparel imported from the West.",
      "At the other end of the street, an upcycled fashion and thrifting festival unfolds with glamour and glitz. Models parade along a makeshift runway in outfits that designers created out of discarded materials from the Kantamanto market, ranging from floral blouses and denim jeans to leather bags, caps and socks.",
      "The festival is called Obroni Wawu October, using a phrase that in the local Akan language means \u201cdead white man\u2019s clothes.\u201d Organizers see the event as a small way to disrupt a destructive cycle that has made Western overconsumption into an environmental problem in Africa, where some of the worn-out clothes end up in waterways and garbage dumps.",
      "\u201cInstead of allowing (textile waste) to choke our gutters or beaches or landfills, I decided to use it to create something ... for us to use again,\u201d said Richard Asante Palmer, one of the designers at the annual festival organized by the Or Foundation, a nonprofit that works at the intersection of environmental justice and fashion development.",
      "Ghana is one of Africa's leading importers of used clothing. It also ships some of what it gets from the United Kingdom, Canada, China and elsewhere to other West African nations, the United States and the U.K., according to the Ghana Used Clothing Dealers Association.",
      "Some of the imported clothes arrive in such poor shape, however, that vendors dispose of them to make room for the next shipments. On average, 40% of the millions of garments exported weekly to Ghana end up as waste, according to Neesha-Ann Longdon, the business manager for the Or Foundation\u2019s executive director.",
      "The clothing dealers association, in a report published earlier this year on the socioeconomic and environmental impact of the nation\u2019s secondhand clothing trade said only 5% of the items that reach Ghana in bulk are immediately thrown out because they cannot be sold or reused.",
      "In many African countries, citizens typically buy preowned clothes \u2014 as well as used cars, phones and other necessities \u2014 because they cost less than new ones. Secondhand shopping also gives them a chance to score designer goods that most people in the region can only dream of.",
      "But neither Ghana's fast-growing population of 34 million people nor its overtaxed infrastructure is equipped to absorb the amount of cast-off attire entering the country. Mounds of textile waste litter beaches across the capital, Accra, and the lagoon which serves as the main outlet through which the city\u2019s major drainage channels empty into the Gulf of Guinea.",
      "\u201cFast fashion has taken over as the dominant mode of production, which is characterized here as higher volumes of lower-quality goods,\u201d Longdon said.",
      "Jonathan Abbey, a fisherman in the area, said his nets often capture textile waste from the sea. Unsold used clothes \u201caren\u2019t even burned but are thrown into the Korle Lagoon, which then goes into the sea,\u201d Abbey said.",
      "The ease of online shopping has sped up this waste cycle, according to Andrew Brooks, a King\u2019s College London researcher and the author of \u201cClothing Poverty: The Hidden World of Fast Fashion and Second-hand Clothes.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.K., unwanted purchases often end up as charity donations, but clothes are sometimes stolen from street donation bins and exported to places where the consumer demand is perceived to be higher, Brooks said. Authorities rarely investigate such theft because the clothes are \"seen as low-value items,\u201d he said.",
      "Donors, meanwhile, think their castoffs are \u201cgoing to be recycled rather than reused, or given away rather than sold, or sold in the U.K. rather than exported overseas,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "The volume of secondhand clothing sent to Africa has led to complaints of the continent being used as a dumping ground. In 2018, Rwanda raised tariffs on such imports in defiance of U.S. pressure, citing concerns the West's refuse undermined efforts to strengthen the domestic textile industry. Last year, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said he would ban imports of clothing \u201cfrom dead people.\u201d",
      "Trade restrictions might not go far in either reducing textile pollution or encouraging clothing production in Africa, where profits are low and incentives for designers are few, experts say.",

      "When Kenyan police arrived in Haiti as part of a U.N.-backed mission earlier this year to quell gang violence, hopes were high",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- When Kenyan police arrived in Haiti as part of a U.N.-backed mission earlier this year to tackle gang violence, hopes were high.",
      "Coordinated gang attacks on prisons, police stations and the main international airport had crippled the country\u2019s capital and forced the prime minister to resign, plunging Haiti into an unprecedented crisis.",
      "But the crisis has only deepened since the international policing contingent arrived. The main international airport closed for the second time this year after gangs opened fire on commercial flights in mid-November, striking a flight attendant. Gunmen also are attacking once-peaceful communities to try and seize control of the entire capital, taking advantage of political infighting that led to the abrupt dismissal of the prime minister earlier this month.",
      "Now, a new prime minister is tasked with turning around a nation that sees no escape from its troubles as Haitians wonder: How did the country reach this point?",
      "Bloody coups, brutal dictatorships and gangs created by Haiti's political and economic elite have long defined the country's history, but experts say the current crisis is the worst they\u2019ve seen.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very bleak about the future,\u201d said Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia. \u201cThe whole situation is really collapsing.\u201d",
      "The government is anemic, the U.N.-backed mission that supports Haiti's understaffed police department lacks funding and personnel, and gangs now control 85% of the capital. Then, on Wednesday, another blow.",
      "Doctors Without Borders announced it was suspending critical care in Port-au-Prince as it accused police of targeting its staff and patients, including threats of rape and death. It\u2019s the first time the aid group has stopped working with new patients since it began operating in Haiti more than 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cEvery day that we cannot resume activities is a tragedy, as we are one of the few providers of a wide range of medical services that have remained open during this extremely difficult year,\u201d said Christophe Garnier, mission director in Haiti.",
      "Lionel Lazarre, deputy spokesman for Haiti\u2019s National Police, did not return messages for comment. Neither did officials with Kenya\u2019s mission when asked about the surge in gang violence.",
      "In a recent statement, the Kenyan-led mission said it was \u201ccognizant of the road ahead that is fraught with challenges.\" But it noted that ongoing joint patrols and operations have secured certain communities and forced gangs to change the way they operate.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Giroux, Canada\u2019s ambassador to Haiti, told The Associated Press on Saturday that his country and others have been trying to bolster the Kenyan-led mission. \u201cThey\u2019ve done miracles, I think, considering all the challenges that we\u2019ve been facing,\" he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we have to keep in mind is that it\u2019s still very much in deployment mode,\u201d Giroux said. \u201cThere are not even 400 on the ground right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Haiti\u2019s new prime minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9, did not return messages for comment. In a statement Thursday, his administration said authorities were strengthening security along the capital's main roads and had formed a special security council.",
      "\u201cThe prime minister renews his commitment to find lasting solutions to current problems,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement was issued just days after gangs launched a pre-dawn attack Tuesday around an upper-class community in Haiti\u2019s capital, forcing residents armed with machetes and guns to fight side-by-side with police to repel gunmen.",
      "At least 28 gang members were killed, but not before some reached an area near an upscale hotel long considered safe.",
      "\u201cIt tells you that there is no functioning authority in Haiti,\" Fatton said.",
      "A main concern in the ongoing crisis is the temporary closure of the main international airport in Port-au-Prince.",
      "It means critical aid is not reaching those who need it the most in a country where nearly 6,000 people are starving and nearly half of the more than 11 million inhabitants are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse. Gang violence also has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the isolation of Port-au-Prince from the rest of Haiti and the world,\u201d said Laurent Uwumuremyi, Mercy Corps\u2019 country director for Haiti.",
      "The aid group helps people including more than 15,000 living in makeshift shelters, but persistent gang violence has prevented workers from reaching a growing number of them in the capital and beyond.",
      "Basic goods also are dwindling as the suspension of flights has delayed imports of critical supplies.",
      "\u201cBefore, there were some neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince that we considered safe that the gangs had never reached, but now they are threatening to take over the control of the entire capital,\u201d Uwumuremyi said.",
      "At least 150 people were reported killed in the capital and 20,000 forced to flee their homes in the second week of November alone. Overall, more than 4,500 people were reported killed in Haiti so far this year, the U.N. said.",
      "Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, a former elite police officer who became a gang leader known as Barbecue, warned that a gang coalition known as Viv Ansanm will keep attacking as they demand the resignation of a transitional presidential council tasked with leading the country along with the new prime minister. The council also is supposed to organize general elections for the first time in nearly a decade so voters can choose a president, a position left empty since President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was killed at his private residence in July 2021.",
      "The U.S. and other countries pushed for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti at a U.N. Security Council meeting this week. Only about 400 officers from Kenya have arrived, along with a handful of police and soldiers from other countries \u2014 way short of the 2,500 personnel slated for the mission.",
      "\u201cThis is not just another wave of insecurity; it is a dramatic escalation that shows no signs of abating,\u201d Miroslav Jen\u010da, U.N. assistant secretary general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, said Wednesday at the meeting.",
      "But Russia and China oppose a U.N. peacekeeping mission, leaving many to wonder what other options are left for Haiti.",
      "Giroux, the Canadian ambassador, said his country supports a peacekeeping operation \u201cwhen the time is right.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody is looking at a peacekeeping mission as a silver bullet,\u201d he said, adding that even if that were to happen, it wouldn\u2019t be able to deploy for another six to 12 months. \u201cWe need to be realistic.\u201d",
      "Giroux said he is hopeful that some 600 Kenyans will arrive in Haiti in upcoming weeks, but added that \"none of this matters if the political elite doesn\u2019t get its act together.\u201d",
      "The nine-member transitional presidential council has been marred by accusations of corruption and infighting and was criticized for firing the previous prime minister.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m at a loss for any short-term solution for Haiti, let alone any long-term solutions,\u201d Fatton said. \u201cThe gangs have seen that they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of the Kenyan mission.\u201d",
      "He said one option may be for the government to negotiate with the gangs.",
      "\u201cAt the moment, it is perceived as utterly unacceptable,\" he said. \"But if the situation deteriorates even more, what else are you left with?\u201d"

      "Thirteen candidates are vying for the presidency in the European Union and NATO member country, and the vote is expected to go to a second round on Dec. 8. Polls opened at 7.00 a.m. local time (0500GMT) and will close at 9.00 p.m. (1900GMT). Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday.",
      "By 8 p.m. local time (1800GMT), 9.2 million people \u2014 about 51% of eligible voters \u2014 had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau.",

      "Romania will also hold parliamentary elections on Dec. 1 that will determine the country's next government and prime minister.",
      "Simion, 38, is a vocal supporter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and has long been a controversial figure. He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from entering neighboring Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI would like that in the next five to ten years, for Romanians to be really proud to be Romanians, to promote Romanian culture, Romanian products,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday in the capital, Bucharest. \u201cAs a Romanian president, I will promote Romanian interests. In most cases, Romanian interests coincide with partner interests.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are at a point where Romania can easily divert or slip toward a populist regime because (voter) dissatisfaction is pretty large among a lot of people from all social strata,\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd the temptation for any regime, any leader \u2014 will be to go on a populist road.\u201d",
      "He added that Romania's large budget deficit, high inflation, and an economic slowdown could push more mainstream candidates to shift toward populist stances amid widespread dissatisfaction.",
      "Ciolacu told the AP that if he is elected, one of his biggest goals is \u201cto convince Romanians that it is worth staying at home or returning\u201d to Romania, which has a massive diaspora spread throughout EU countries.",
      "\u201cRomania has a huge chance to become a developed economy in the next 10 years, where honest work is fairly rewarded and people have the security of a better life,\" he said. \"But for this, we need balance and responsibility ...

      "Tens of thousands of Spaniards are marching in downtown Barcelona to protest the skyrocketing cost of renting an apartment in the popular tourist destination",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in downtown Barcelona on Saturday to protest the skyrocketing cost of renting an apartment in the popular tourist destination.",
      "Protesters cut off traffic on main avenues in the city center, holding up homemade signs in Spanish reading \u201cFewer apartments for investing and more homes for living\" and \u201cThe people without homes uphold their rights.\u201d",
      "The lack of affordable housing has become one of the leading concerns for the southern European Union country, mirroring the housing crunch across many parts of the world, including the United States.",
      "Organizers said that over 170,000 had turned out, while Barcelona\u2019s police said they estimated some 22,000 marched.",
      "Either way, the throngs of people clogging the streets recalled the massive separatist rallies at the height of the previous decade\u2019s Catalan independence movement. Now, social concerns led by housing have displaced political crusades.",
      "That is because the average rent for Spain has doubled in last 10 years. The price per square meter has risen from 7.2 euros ($7.5) in 2014 to 13 euros this year, according to the popular online real estate website Idealista. The growth is even more acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid. Incomes meanwhile have failed to keep up, especially for younger people in a country with chronically high unemployment.",
      "Protester Samuel Saintot said he is \u201cfrustrated and scared\u201d after being told by the owners of the apartment he has rented for the past 15 years in Barcelona\u2019s city center that he must vacate the premises. He suspects that the owners want him out so they can renovate it and boost the price.",
      "\u201cEven looking in a 20- or 30-kilometer radius outside town, I can\u2019t even find anything within the price range I can afford,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I consider myself a very fortunate person, because I earn a decent salary. And even in my case, I may be forced to leave town.\u201d",
      "A report by the Bank of Spain indicates that nearly 40% of Spaniards who rent dedicate an average of 40% of their income to paying rents and utilities, compared to the European Union average of 27% of renters who do so.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a housing emergency. It means people having many difficulties both in accessing and staying in their homes,\u201d said Ignasi Mart\u00ed, professor for Esade business school and head of its Dignified Housing Observatory.",
      "The rise in rents is causing significant pain in Spain, where traditionally people seek to own their homes.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term renters including tourists. Many migrants to Spain are also disproportionately hit by the high rents because they often do not have enough savings.",
      "Spain is near the bottom end of OECD countries with under 2% of all housing available being public housing for rent. The OECD average is 7%. Spain is far behind France, with 14%, Britain with 16%, and the Netherlands with 34%.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to make prices fall to what they were a few years back. It makes me cry,\u201d said protester Laia Pizju\u00e1n. \u201cIt's so upsetting. I know so many people who are in a bad situation. I have relatives living together in crowded apartments because they can\u2019t afford to live on their own.\u201d",
      "Carme Arcarazo, spokesperson for Barcelona\u2019s Tenants Union which helped organize the protest, said that renters should consider a \u201crent strike\u201d and cease paying their monthly rents in a mass protest movement.",
      "\u201cI think we the tenants have understood that this depends on us. That we can\u2019t keep asking and making demands to the authorities and waiting for an answer. We must take the reins of the situation,\u201d Arcarazo told the AP. \u201cSo, if they (the owners) won\u2019t lower the rent, then we will force them to do it.\"",
      "The Barcelona protest came a month after tens of thousands rallied against high rents in Madrid.",
      "The rising discontent over housing is putting pressure on Spain\u2019s governing Socialist party, which leads a coalition on the national level and is in charge of Catalonia\u2019s regional government and Barcelona\u2019s city hall.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez presided over what the government termed a \u201chousing summit\u201d including government officials and real estate developers last month. But the Barcelona\u2019s Tenants Union boycotted the event, saying it was like calling a summit for curing cancer and inviting tobacco companies to participate.",
      "The leading government measure has been a rent cap mechanism that the central government has offered to regional authorities based on a price index established by the housing ministry. Rent controls can be applied to areas deemed to be \u201chighly stressed\u201d by high rental prices. Catalonia was the first region to apply those caps, which are in place in downtown Barcelona.",
      "Many locals blame the million of tourists who visit Barcelona, and the rest of Spain, each year for the high prices. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate the city\u2019s 10,000 so called \u201ctourist apartments,\u201d or dwellings with permits for short-term rents, by 2028."

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he'll nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary, one of several personnel decisions that he unveiled as he closed out the workweek.",
      "Trump also said he would nominate Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget, the same position he held during Trump's first presidency. Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump's second term that the GOP nominee tried to distance himself from during the campaign.",
      "The announcements showed how Trump was trying to balance competing perspectives as he pursues an aggressive and sometimes contradictory economic agenda that includes cutting taxes, reducing government spending, putting tariffs on foreign imports and lowering prices for American consumers.",
      "Although Bessent is closely aligned with Wall Street and could earn bipartisan support, Vought is known as a Republican hardliner on budget and cultural issues.",
      "Trump said Bessent would \u201chelp me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States,\" while Vought \u201cknows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government.\u201d",
      "After announcing his choices for key financial posts, Trump kept up the pace of what has been a breakneck transition process.",
      "Trump picked Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, a rare Republican who is considered a stalwart union ally, as his labor secretary. He also said he would nominate Scott Turner, a former football player who worked in Trump's first administration, to serve as his housing secretary.",
      "More choices were named for health and national security positions. In less than three weeks since the election, Trump has announced decisions for almost his entire Cabinet.",
      "Bessent, 62, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation\u2019s first openly gay treasury secretary.",
      "He told Bloomberg in August that attacking the U.S. national debt should be a priority, which includes slashing government programs and other spending.",
      "\u201cThis election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,\u201d he said then.",
      "As of Nov. 8, the national debt stands at $35.94 trillion, with both the Trump and Biden administrations having added to it. Trump\u2019s policies added $8.4 trillion to the national debt, while the Biden administration increased the national debt by $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog.",
      "Even as he pushes to lower the national debt by stopping spending, Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from different economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years. Nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore\u2019s presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. Bessent had an influential role in Soros\u2019 London operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on \u201cBlack Wednesday,\u201d when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.",
      "Bessent previously told Bloomberg that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\u201d and he said tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives,\" such as encouraging allies to spend more on defense or deterring military aggression.",
      "In addition, Bessent has floated ideas for how Trump could put pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Last month, Bessent suggested Trump could name a replacement chair early, and let that person function as a \u201cshadow\u201d chair, with the goal of essentially sidelining Powell.",
      "But after the election, Bessent reportedly backed away from that plan. Powell, for his part, has said he wouldn\u2019t step down if Trump asked him to do so, and added that Trump, as president, wouldn't have the authority to fire him.",
      "Trump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term as president for raising the Fed\u2019s key rate in 2017 and 2018. During the 2024 campaign, he said that as president he should have a \u201csay\u201d in the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions. Presidents traditionally avoid commenting on the Fed\u2019s policies.",
      "Vought, 48, was the head of the Office of Management and Budget from mid-2020 to the end of Trump\u2019s first term in 2021, having previously served as the acting director and deputy director. He's paired a deep knowledge of government finances with his own Christian faith.",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as renewing \"a consensus of America as a nation under God.\u201d",
      "The Center for Renewing America released its own 2023 budget proposal entitled \u201cA Commitment to End Woke and Weaponized Government.\u201d The proposal envisioned $11.3 trillion worth of spending reductions over 10 years and about $2 trillion in income tax cuts in order to bring the budget into surplus by 2032.",
      "\u201cThe immediate threat facing the nation is the fact that the people no longer govern the country; instead, the government itself is increasingly weaponized against the people it is meant to serve,\u201d Vought wrote in the introduction.",
      "Vought\u2019s proposed budget plan would cut spending on food aid through the Agriculture Department. There would be $3.3 trillion in spending reductions in the Health and Human Services Department in large part through how Medicaid and Medicare funds are distributed. It also contains about $642 billion in cuts to Affordable Care Act. The budgets for the Housing and Urban Development and Education departments would also be cut.",
      "Vought\u2019s budget ideas were independent of Trump, who has not entirely spelled out the details of his economic plans.",
      "Trump's choice for labor secretary, Chavez-DeRemer, 56, narrowly lost her reelection bid earlier this month. She received strong backing from union members in her district.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer is one of a few House Republicans to endorse the \u201cProtecting the Right to Organize\u201d or PRO Act that would allow more workers to conduct organizing campaigns and would add penalties for companies that violate workers\u2019 rights. The act would also weaken \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that allow employees in more than half the states to avoid participating in or paying dues to unions that represent workers at their places of employment.",
      "Trump said in a statement that she would help \u201censure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success.\u201d",
      "In addition, Trump added to his health team on Friday evening.

      "Trump previously said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime spreader of conspiracy theories about vaccines, as health secretary.",

Wong worked on issues involving Asia during Trump\u2019s first term, and Gorka is a conservative commentator who spent less than a year in Trump\u2019s first White House."

      "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has big plans for the economy \u2014 and a big debt problem that will be a hurdle to delivering on them.",
      "Trump has bold ideas on tax cuts, tariffs and other programs, but high interest rates and the price of repaying the federal government\u2019s existing debt could limit what he\u2019s able to do.",
      "Not only is the federal debt at roughly $36 trillion, but the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up the government's borrowing costs such that debt service next year will easily exceed spending on national security.",
      "The higher cost of servicing the debt gives Trump less room to maneuver with the federal budget as he seeks income tax cuts. It's also a political challenge because higher interest rates have made it costlier for many Americans to buy a home or new automobile. And the issue of high costs helped Trump reclaim the presidency in November's election.",
      "\u201cIt's clear the current amount of debt is putting upward pressure on interest rates, including mortgage rates for instance,\" said Shai Akabas, executive director of the economic policy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThe cost of housing and groceries is going to be increasingly felt by households in a way that are going to adversely affect our economic prospects in the future.\u201d",
      "Akabas stressed that the debt service is already starting to crowd out government spending on basic needs such as infrastructure and education. About 1 in 5 dollars spent by the government are now repaying investors for borrowed money, instead of enabling investments in future economic growth.",
      "It's an issue on Trump's radar. In his statement on choosing billionaire investor Scott Bessent to be his treasury secretary, the Republican president-elect said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt.\u201d",
      "The debt service costs along with the higher total debt complicate Trump's efforts to renew his 2017 tax cuts, much of which are set to expire after next year. The higher debt from those tax cuts could push interest rates higher, making debt service even costlier and minimizing any benefits the tax cuts could produce for growth.",
      "\u201cClearly, it's irresponsible to run back the same tax cuts after the deficit has tripled,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a former Republican congressional aide. \u201cEven congressional Republicans behind the scenes are looking for ways to scale down the president\u2019s ambitions.\u201d",
      "Democrats and many economists say Trump's income tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which deprives the government of revenues needed for programs for the middle class and poor.",
      "\"The president-elect\u2019s tax policy ideas will increase the deficit because they will decrease taxes for those with the highest ability to pay, such as the corporations whose tax rate he\u2019s proposed reducing even further to 15%,\u201d said Jessica Fulton, vice president of policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that deals with issues facing communities of color.",
      "Trump's team insists he can make the math work.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including lowering prices. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump transition spokeswoman.",
      "When Trump was last in the White House in 2020, the federal government was spending $345 billion annually to service the national debt. It was possible to run up the national debt with tax cuts and pandemic aid because the average interest rate was low, such that repayment costs were manageable even as debt levels climbed.",
      "Congressional Budget Office projections indicate that debt service costs next year could exceed $1 trillion. That's more than projected spending on defense. The total is also greater than nondefense spending on infrastructure, food aid and other programs under the direction of Congress.",
      "What fueled the increased cost of servicing the debt has been higher interest rates. In April 2020, when the government was borrowing trillions of dollars to address the pandemic, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell as low as 0.6%. They're now 4.4%, having increasing since September as investors expect Trump to add several trillions of dollars onto projected deficits with his income tax cuts.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden can point to strong economic growth and successfully avoiding a recession as the Federal Reserve sought to bring down inflation. Still, deficits ran at unusually high levels during his term. That's due in part to his own initiatives to boost manufacturing and address climate change, and to the legacy of Trump's previous tax cuts.",
      "People in Trump's orbit, as well as Republican lawmakers, are already scouting out ways to reduce government spending in order to minimize the debt and bring down interest rates. They have attacked Biden for the deficits and inflation, setting the stage for whether they can persuade Trump to take action.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy businessmen leading Trump's efforts to cut government costs, have proposed that the incoming administration should simply refuse to spend some of the money approved by Congress. It's an idea that Trump has also backed, but one that would likely provoke challenges in court as it would undermine congressional authority.",
      "Russell Vought, the White House budget director during Trump's first term and Trump's choice to lead it again, put out an alternative proposed budget for 2023 with more than $11 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in order to potentially generate a surplus.",
      "Michael Faulkender, a finance professor who served in Trump's Treasury Department, told a congressional committee in March that all the energy and environmental components of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 should be repealed to reduce deficits.",
      "Trump has also talked up tariffs on imports to generate revenues and reduce deficits, while some Republican lawmakers such as House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, have discussed adding work requirements to trim Medicaid expenses.",
      "The White House was last pressured by high rates to address debt service costs roughly three decades ago during the start of Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency. Higher yields on the 10-year Treasury notes led Clinton and Congress to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, ultimately producing a budget surplus starting in 1998.",
      "Clinton political adviser James Carville joked at the time about how bond investors pushing up borrowing rates for the U.S. government could humble the commander in chief.",
      "\u201cI used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter,\" Carville said. \"But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\u201d"

      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Less is known about Trump's pick for the Atlanta-based CDC, which develops vaccines and monitors for infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "Weldon is a staunch, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican. Legislation he introduced more than 20 years ago outlawed human cloning. He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",
      "Weldon's nomination is likely to placate some anti-abortion advocates, who have been concerned about Trump's nomination of Kennedy, a longtime Democrat and proponent of abortion rights, as the nation's top health official.",
      "Weldon retired from his congressional seat in 2008, after 14 years in public office. Earlier this year, he lost in a GOP primary for a seat in the Florida Legislature.",
      "If he's confirmed, he'll be in charge of more than 13,000 employees and nearly 13,000 other contract workers.",
      "Nesheiwat, meanwhile, will oversee 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members if the Republican-controlled Senate approves her nomination as the surgeon general. She is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York. She appears regularly on Fox News and has expressed frequent support for Trump, sharing photos of them together on her social media pages.",
      "Surgeons general also have the power to issue advisories, warning of public health threats in the U.S. Those advisories can influence how the government, public and medical community respond to health crises in the country.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:10:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nigeria faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation after the government ended costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa&rsquo;s most populous country",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation after the government ended costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa\u2019s most populous country",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- When Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu ended the costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa's most populous country, Ahmed Halilu knew his e-hailing cab business in the capital, Abuja, was about to run into huge losses.",
      "Transportation costs skyrocketed as the price of petrol more than tripled in the months that followed last year's decision, resulting in the country\u2019s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. That meant a massive drop in the number of Halilu's passengers and ultimately in his earnings.",
      "In what they said would eventually lower transportation costs by almost 50%, Nigerian authorities in August introduced a compressed natural gas (CNG) initiative to tap its huge gas reserves \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest \u2014 and roll out CNG buses while switching petrol-powered vehicles to use it.",
      "More than 100,000 vehicles have been adapted to run on CNG or with the hybrid option of CNG and petrol, and at least $200 million has been invested by the government under the initiative, according to its director, Michael Oluwagbemi.",
      "The government aims to convert 1 million of Nigeria's over 11 million vehicles in the next three years, but analysts say the process has been slow, pointing to poor implementation and limited infrastructure.",
      "Although Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s top oil producers, it depends on imported refined petroleum products because its refineries are struggling, with production at its lowest in decades amid massive oil theft.",
      "Together with other reforms introduced by Tinubu after coming to power in May last year, the removal of subsidies was supposed to save the government money and shore up dwindling foreign investments.",
      "However, it has affected the price of just about everything, and soaring transportation costs force people to abandon their vehicles and walk to work.",
      "Switching over to gas is hard. In addition to the lack of an adequate network of CNG conversion and filling stations \u2014 available in 13 of Nigeria's 36 states \u2014 the success of the government's initiative also has been limited by low public awareness.",
      "That has left room for misinformation and hesitancy among drivers.",
      "\u201cPeople are not keen about it because of a lack of orientation,\" Halilu said. He converted his vehicle and now saves $240 monthly on petrol costs in his e-hailing business.",
      "Some drivers have expressed fear that their cars could explode with the CNG conversion \u2014 claims that regulatory agencies have said are untrue unless the equipment is installed inappropriately. In southern Edo state, authorities found that a CNG-powered vehicle that exploded had been worked on by an unaccredited vendor.",
      "Even in Abuja and the economic hub of Lagos, filling stations are scarce and the few available conversion workshops are often lined with commercial vehicles waiting for days to switch to CNG at subsidized rates.",
      "Meanwhile, the cost for private vehicles to switch is 20 times Nigeria\u2019s minimum monthly wage of $42.",
      "A colleague had to travel about 200 kilometers (124 miles) to Abuja to refill his cylinder, said Abdul Manasseh, an e-hailing taxi driver in Abuja.",
      "Another challenge that has slowed the initiative is Nigeria\u2019s limited gas pipeline, which makes supplying stations difficult. As a result, most parts of the northern and eastern states have not been reached.",
      "The challenges echo those for the shift to electric vehicles in Nigeria, where the adoption by private operators has been slow. The power supply remains fitful for most of the country\u2019s 210 million citizens, mainly as a result of underinvestment and vandalism.",
      "The government understands there is still \u201ca lot of uncertainty\u201d around the CNG initiative and is working to correct the misconceptions and provide the needed infrastructure, said Tosin Coker, the initiative's head of commercial matters.",
      "\u201cCNG is a cleaner fuel, it is a cheaper fuel and it is a safer fuel compared to the petrol that we are used to,\" Coker said. \u201cSo you will have more money in your pocket and it's cleaner for the environment.\u201d",

      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",

      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has chosen money manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction and deregulation, to serve as his next treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent is a past supporter of Democrats who has become an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. He\u2019s an advocate of cutting spending while extending the tax cuts approved by Congress in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Here are four things to know about the South Carolina billionaire who, if confirmed by the Senate, will manage the nation's finances:",
      "Before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore\u2019s presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "Bessent had an influential role in Soros\u2019 London investment operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on \u201cBlack Wednesday,\u201d when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office, though estimates from various economic analysis of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "Bessent calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that the tax extension would add to the federal deficit.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a negotiation with the Republican Congress,\" Bessent told CNBC on Nov. 6. \u201cI\u2019ve already been in conversations with a lot of the Republicans who will chair those committees,\" he said. \"The Republican Congress, there's a big appetite for pay-fors. It will be a negotiation.\u201d",
      "He has in media interviews spoken about the need to tackle the nation's debt. \u201cI do think this debt and deficit is going to be the big issue of the day. I think Americans are worried about it.\" He argues that consumer prices can be brought down \"by starting with a deficit reduction program.\u201d",
      "Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "Bessent told Bloomberg in August that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\" and tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. \"I think that tariffs in a way can be regarded as an economic sanction without a sanction. If you don't like Chinese economic policy, flooding the market with over production, you could put a sanction on them, or a tariff. Its also an answer to currency manipulation.\u201d",
      "And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\u201d",
      "He told CNBC that \u201cI would recommend that tariffs be layered in gradually.\"",
      "If confirmed to the role, he would also be the first openly LGBTQ Senate-confirmed cabinet member in a Republican administration.",
      "In 2020, Trump named Richard Grenell, who is openly gay, acting director of national intelligence. However, the role was not subject to Senate confirmation.",
      "In 2015, Bessent told the Yale Alumni Magazine: \u201cIf you had told me in 1984, when we graduated, and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I\u2019d be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d",

Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his second administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions in her district but lost reelection in November.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer will have to be confirmed by the Senate, which will be under Republican control when Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, and can formally send nominations to Capitol Hill.",
      "Here are things to know about the labor secretary-designate, the agency she would lead if she wins Senate approval and how she could matter to Trump's encore presidency.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer is a one-term congresswoman, having lost reelection in her competitive Oregon district earlier this month. But in her short stint on Capitol Hill she has established a clear record on workers' rights and organized labor issues that belie the Republican Party's usual alliances with business interests.",
      "She was an enthusiastic back of the PRO Act, legislation that would make it easier to unionize on a federal level. The bill, one of Democratic President Joe Biden's top legislative priorities, passed the House during Biden's first two years in office, when Democrats controlled the chamber. But it never had a chance of attracting enough Republican senators to reach the 60 votes required to avoid a filibuster in the Senate.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer also co-sponsored another piece of legislation that would protect public-sector workers from having their Social Security benefits docked because of government pension benefits. That proposal also has lingered for a lack of GOP support.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer may give labor plenty to like, but union leaders are not necessarily cheering yet. Many of them still do not trust Trump.",
      "The president-elect certainly has styled himself as a friend of the working class. His bond with blue-collar, non-college educated Americans is a core part of his political identity and helped him chip away at Democrats' historical electoral advantage in households with unionized workers.",
      "But he was also the president who chose business-friendly appointees to the National Labor Relations Board during his 2017-21 term and generally has backed policies that would make it harder for workers to unionize. He criticized union bosses on the campaign trail, and at one point suggested members of the United Auto Workers should not pay their dues. His administration did expand overtime eligibility rules, but not nearly as much as Democrats wanted, and a Trump-appointed judge has since struck down the Biden administration's more generous overtime rules.",
      "And though Trump distanced himself from the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 during the campaign, he has since his victory warmed to some of the people involved in that conservative blueprint that, broadly speaking, would tilt power in the workplace even more toward employers and corporations. Among other ideas, the plan also would curb enforcement of workplace safety regulations.",
      "After Trump's announcement Friday, National Education Association President Becky Pringle lauded Chavez-DeRemer's House record but sounded a note of caution.",
      "\u201cEducators and working families across the nation will be watching ... as she moves through the confirmation process,\u201d Pringle said in a statement, \u201cand hope to hear a pledge from her to continue to stand up for workers and students as her record suggests, not blind loyalty to the Project 2025 agenda.\u201d",
      "AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler praised Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s \u201cpro-labor record in Congress,\u201d but said \u201cit remains to be seen what she will be permitted to do as Secretary of Labor in an administration with a dramatically anti-worker agenda.\u201d",
      "Labor is another executive department that often operates away from the spotlight. But Trump's emphasis on the working class could intensify attention on the department, especially in an administration replete with tremendously wealthy leaders, including the president-elect.",
      "Trump took implicit aim at the department's historically uncontroversial role of maintaining labor statistics, arguing that Biden's administration manipulated calculations of unemployment and the workforce.",
      "If she is confirmed, Chavez-DeRemer could find herself standing between the nonpartisan bureaucrats at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a president with strong opinions about government stats and what they say about the state of the economy \u2014 and the White House's stewardship. Her handling of overtime rules also would be scrutinized, and she could find herself pulled into whatever becomes of Trump's promise to launch the largest deportation force in U.S. history, potentially pitting Trump's administration against economic sectors and companies that depend heavily on immigrant labor.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Oregon. She joins Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, as the second Latino pick for Trump's second Cabinet. Trump's first labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, also was Latino."

      "Negotiators will soon decide whether to accept a proposed $300 billion funding package for poor nations to curb and adapt to climate change \u2014 a plan hammered out early Sunday by the head of fractured United Nations climate talks",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- United Nations climate talks adopted a deal to inject at least $300 billion annually in humanity\u2019s fight against climate change, aimed at helping developing nations cope with the ravages of global warming in tense negotiations.",
      "The $300 billion will go to developing countries who need the cash to wean themselves off the coal, oil and gas that causes the globe to overheat, adapt to future warming and pay for the damage caused by climate change\u2019s extreme weather. It\u2019s not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, but it\u2019s three times a deal of $100 billion a year from 2009 that is expiring. Some delegations said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future.",
      "But it was not quite the agreement by consensus that these meetings usually operate with and some developing nations were livid about being ignored.",
      "COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev gaveled the deal into acceptance before any nation had a chance to speak. When they did they blasted him for being unfair to them, the deal for not being enough and the world's rich nations for being too stingy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a paltry sum,\u201d India negotiator Chandni Raina said, repeatedly saying how India objected to rousing cheers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say we cannot accept it.\u201d",
      "She told The Associated Press that she has lost faith in the United Nations system.",
      "A long line of nations agreed with India and piled on, with Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, CEO of the National Council on Climate Change, calling the deal an insult and a joke.",
      "\"I\u2019m disappointed. It\u2019s definitely below the benchmark that we have been fighting for for so long,\u201d said Juan Carlos Monterrey, of the Panama delegation. He noted that a few changes, including the inclusion of the words \u201cat least\u201d before the number $300 billion and an opportunity for revision by 2030, helped push them to the finish line.",
      "\"Our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over,\u201d he said.",
      "The final package pushed through \u201cdoes not speak or reflect or inspire confidence,\u201d India's Raina said.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely object to the unfair means followed for adoption,\u201d Raina said. \u201cWe are extremely hurt by this action by the president and the secretariat.\u201d",
      "Speaking for nearly 50 of the poorest nations of the world, Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi was more mild, expressing what he called reservations with the deal. And the Alliance of Small Island States' Cedric Schuster said he had more hope \u201cthat the process would protect the interests of the most vulnerable\" but nevertheless expressed tempered support for the deal.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X that he hoped for a \u201cmore ambitious outcome.\u201d But he said the agreement \u201cprovides a base on which to build.\u201d",
      "There were somewhat satisfied parties, with European Union's Wopke Hoekstra calling it a new era of climate funding, working hard to help the most vulnerable. But activists in the plenary hall could be heard coughing over Hoekstra's speech in an attempt to disrupt it.",
      "Eamon Ryan, Ireland\u2019s environment minister, called the agreement \u201ca huge relief.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was not certain. This was tough,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a time of division, of war, of (a) multilateral system having real difficulties, the fact that we could get it through in these difficult circumstances is really important.\u201d",
      "U.N. Climate Change's Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the deal an \u201cinsurance policy for humanity,\u201d adding that like insurance, \u201cit only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.\u201d",
      "The deal is seen as a step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It\u2019s part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.",
      "The Paris agreement set the system of regular ratcheting up climate fighting ambition as away to keep warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and carbon emissions keep rising.",
      "Countries also anticipate that this deal will send signals that help drive funding from other sources, like multilateral development banks and private sources. That was always part of the discussion at these talks \u2014 rich countries didn\u2019t think it was realistic to only rely on public funding sources \u2014 but poor countries worried that if the money came in loans instead of grants, it would send them sliding further backward into debt that they already struggle with.",
      "\u201cThe $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,\u201d said World Resources Institute President Ani Dasgupta. \u201cThis deal gets us off the starting block. Now the race is on to raise much more climate finance from a range of public and private sources, putting the whole financial system to work behind developing countries\u2019 transitions.\u201d",
      "And even though it's far from the needed $1.3 trillion, it's more than the $250 billion that was on the table in an earlier draft of the text, which outraged many countries and led to a period of frustration and stalling over the final hours of the summit.",
      "The several different texts adopted early Sunday morning included a vague but not specific reference to last year's Global Stocktake approved in Dubai. Last year there was a battle about first-of-its-kind language on getting rid of the oil, coal and natural gas, but instead it called for a transition away from fossil fuels. The latest talks only referred to the Dubai deal, but did not explicitly repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "Countries also agreed on the adoption of Article 6, creating markets to trade carbon pollution rights, an idea that was set up as part of the Paris Agreement to help nations work together to reduce climate-causing pollution. Part of that was a system of carbon credits, allowing nations to put planet-warming gasses in the air if they offset emissions elsewhere. Backers said a U.N.-backed market could generate up to an additional $250 billion a year in climate financial aid.",
      "Despite its approval, carbon markets remain a contentious plan because many experts say the new rules adopted don\u2019t prevent misuse, don\u2019t work and give big polluters an excuse to continue spewing emissions.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done essentially is undermine the mandate to try to reach 1.5,\u201d said Tamara Gilbertson, climate justice program coordinator with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Greenpeace\u2019s An Lambrechts, called it a \u201cclimate scam\u201d with many loopholes.",
      "With this deal wrapped up as crews dismantle the temporary venue, many have eyes on next year\u2019s climate talks in Belem, Brazil.",

      "Mexico has been taking a bashing for allegedly serving as a conduit for Chinese parts and products into North America",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico has been taking a bashing lately for allegedly serving as a conduit for Chinese parts and products into North America, and officials here are afraid a re-elected Donald Trump or politically struggling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could try to leave their country out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.",
      "Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party is so afraid of losing the trade deal that President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday the government has gone on a campaign to get companies to replace Chinese parts with locally made ones.",
      "\u201cWe have a plan with the aim of substituting these imports that come from China, and producing the majority of them in Mexico, either with Mexican companies or primarily North American companies,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "While Sheinbaum claimed Mexico had been working on that effort since t he 2021 global supply chain crisis \u2014 when factories around the world were stalled by a lack of parts and particularly computer chips from Asia \u2014 it appears to be an uphill battle. Even the United States has faced big challenges in moving chip production back home despite billions in subsidies and incentives.",
      "Mexico gained tens of thousands of jobs when U.S. and foreign automakers moved their plants to Mexico under the free trade pact to take advantage of much lower wages. But the idea that Chinese parts \u2014 or even whole cars \u2014 could be piggybacking on that arrangement to further hollow out the U.S. auto industry has enraged some people north of the border.",
      "So Mexico is scrambling with private companies to get them to move parts production here.",
      "\u201cNext year, God willing, we are going to start making microchips in Mexico,\u201d Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday. \u201cOf course they're not yet the most advanced chips, but we are going to start producing them here.\u201d",
      "Mexico's nationalistic ruling party, which is normally very resistant to being seen as bending to U.S. demands, is scrambling in other ways, too.",
      "The ruling party is in the process of eliminating a half-dozen independent regulatory and oversight agencies that were established by former presidents. That includes the anti-monopoly, transparency and energy regulatory bodies. Together with reforms that will make all judges stand for election in Mexico, that has sparked concern in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "Countries are required under the agreement to have some independent agencies, in part to protect foreign investors. For example, they could prevent a government from approving a monopoly for a state-owned company that could force competitors out of the market.",
      "So ruling-party legislators are actually re-writing the proposed laws to exactly mimic the minimum accepted requirements under the trade accord.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done is to create a reform so that its almost exactly equal to what exists in the United States, so we can clear that up,\u201d Ebrard said.",
      "It's all part of a very legalistic defense of the trade accord, signed in 2018 and approved in 2019. Mexico hopes the rules of the agreement would prevent the U.S. or Canada from simply walking away when the trade pact comes up for review in 2026. Experts agree, saying that totally abandoning the accord is unlikely.",
      "Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base notes that if a country is dissatisfied with the trade agreement during the periodic reviews, like in 2026, there is a clause in the pact that says they can ask for a review each year to work out a solution, and keep doing that for a decade while the agreement remains in force.",
      "\u201cThat is, they wouldn't be able to get out until 2036,\u201d Siller said. \u201cI think they will play hardball with Mexico in the 2026 review.\u201d",
      "Like any marriage, when the pact no longer works for one party, it may still drag on for years but it\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.",
      "C.J. Mahoney. who served as deputy U.S. trade representative in Trump's first administration, said in a talk for the Texas-based Baker Institute in September that the United States probably wouldn't end the trade agreement. But with growingly vocal critics of the pact it could hold up renewing it for years.",
      "\u201cThe costs of not renewing immediately are actually quite relatively low,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cI think the inclination to just kick the can down the road will be pretty strong.\u201d",
      "Because many companies won't make big investments in production facilities without certainty, that could be a serious if not fatal blow to the pact.",
      "How much does Mexico actually buy from China? Mexican officials say they have fewer imports of Chinese parts and products than the United States does. But given the enormous size difference between the two countries' economies, it is a true but weak argument.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Mexico that were made elsewhere, in an attempt to stop China from avoiding import taxes by routing goods through Mexico. It includes a 25% tariff on steel not melted or poured in Mexico and a 10% tariff on aluminum.",
      "Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, has called for stopping Mexican steel imports, saying \u201cthe alarming rise in Chinese steel and aluminum coming into the country through Mexico ... is unsustainable and a threat to American jobs, as well as our economy and national security.\"",
      "In the end, Mexico may be forced to crack down on Chinese imports, but it won't be easy.",
      "\u201cReducing the dependence on Chinese imports is not going to be achieved in the short or medium term,\" said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ramos, a professor of public administration at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana."

      "NEW YORK -- With a combined $270 million in worldwide ticket sales, \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d breathed fresh life into a box office that has struggled lately, leading to one of the busiest moviegoing weekends of the year.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish big-budget musical \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, debuted with $114 million domestically and $164.2 million globally for Universal Pictures, according to studio estimates Sunday. That made it the third-biggest opening weekend of the year, behind only \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d It\u2019s also a record for a Broadway musical adaptation.",
      "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d a sequel to his 2000 best picture-winning original, launched with $55.5 million in ticket sales. With a price tag of around $250 million to produce it, \u201cGladiator II\u201d was a big bet by Paramount Pictures to return to the Coliseum with a largely new cast, led by Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal. While it opened with a touch less than the $60 million predicted in domestic ticket sales, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has performed well overseas. It added $50.5 million internationally.",
      "The collision of the two movies led to some echoes of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d effect of last year, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d launched simultaneously. The nickname this time, \u201cGlicked,\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as catchy and the cultural imprint was also notably less. Few people sought out a double feature this time. The domestic grosses in 2023 \u2013 $162 million for \u201cBarbie\u201d and $82 million for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013 were also higher.",
      "For Universal, which distributed \u201cOppenheimer\" last year, the weekend was more a triumph of \u201cWicked\" than it was of \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw an opportunity to dominate a weekend and get a very large running start into the Thanksgiving holiday,\" said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \"We're very confident that it will play ridiculously well through the Christmas corridor and into the new year.\u201d",
      "But the counter-programming effect was still potent for \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which likewise split broadly along gender lines. And it was again the female-leaning release \u2013 \u201cWicked,\u201d like \u201cBarbie\u201d before it \u2013 that easily won the weekend. About 72% of ticket buyers for \u201cWicked\u201d were female, while 61% of those seeing \u201cGladiator II\u201d were male.",
      "\u201cStanding on their own, each of these movies may have done pretty much what they did, but it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cRaising awareness can indeed lead to an increase in box office. Let\u2019s put it this way: They didn\u2019t hurt each other at all.\u201d",
      "While \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d benefitted enormously from meme-spread word-of-mouth, both \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d leaned on all-out marketing blitzes.",
      "The \u201cGladiator II\u201d campaign featured everything from a much-debated Airbnb cross-promotion with the actual Colosseum in Rome to simultaneously running a one-minute trailer on more than 4,000 TV networks, radio station and digital platforms.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d onslaught went even further, with pink and green themed \u201cWickedly Delicious\u201d Starbucks drinks, Stanley mugs and Mattel dolls (some of which led to an awkward recall ). Its stars made appearances at the Met Gala and the Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe had roughly 400 global brand partners on \u2018Wicked,\u2019 so the campaign was inescapable, said Orr. \u201cAnd our cast, led by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, worked so hard on this. They were everywhere. They did everything we asked them to do.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend, box office was down about 11% from last year and some 25% from pre-pandemic times. That meant this week's two headline films led a much-needed resurgence for theaters. With \u201cMoana 2\u201d releasing Wednesday, Hollywood might be looking at historic sales over the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\u201cThis weekend\u2019s two strong openers are invigorating a box office that fell apart after a good summer,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "Though \u201cWicked\u201d will face some direct competition from \u201cMoana 2,\u201d it would seem better set up for a long and lucrative run in theaters than \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Though some have dinged \u201cWicked\u201d for running long, at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film has had mostly stellar reviews. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore. The reception for \u201cWicked\u201d has been strong enough that Oscar prognosticators expect it to be a contender for best picture at the Academy Awards, among other categories.",
      "Producers, perhaps sensing a hit, also took the step of splitting \u201cWicked\u201d in two. Part two, already filmed, is due out next November. Each \u201cWicked\u201d installation cost around $150 million to make.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d has also enjoyed good reviews, particularly for Washington's charismatic performance. Audience scores, though, were weaker, with ticket buyers giving it a \u201cB\u201d on CinemaScore. The film will make up for some of that, however, with robust international sales. It launched in many overseas markets a week ago, and has already accrued $165.5 million internationally.",
      "Coming in a distant third place for the weekend was \u201cRed One,\u201d the Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans holiday movie turned action film. In its second week of release, the Amazon MGM Studios release grossed $13.3 million to bring its two-week global haul to $117 million. At a cost of $250 million to make, \u201cRed One\u201d is the season's biggest flop, though it could recoup some value for Amazon if it's more popular once it begins streaming.",

      "Finance Minister Makis Keravnos said the upgrade marks the first time that Moody\u2019s has elevated Cyprus back into the upper medium grade investment category since 2011, when a brewing financial crisis brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy that required a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund two years later.",
      "Moody\u2019s said its rationale for the ratings upgrade and stable outlook was grounded in Cyprus\u2019 \u201cprudent fiscal policy\u201d that combined spending cuts with strong public revenue growth, resulting in fiscal surpluses over the last two years.",
      "The agency said smaller fiscal surpluses are expected to continue until 2028, while a drop in public debt \u201chas been one of the most substantial globally,\u201d dropping from 113.6% of gross domestic product in 2020 to 73% in 2023.",
      "According to Moody\u2019s, debt is forecast to continue dropping to 50% in 2027, while the economy will grow by an average of 3.2% between 2024 and 2028, thanks to continued growth in sectors including information and communication technology, finance and insurance.",
      "Companies are opting to set up their headquarters in Cyprus, particularly from Ukraine, Israel and the Middle East. Foreign investment in energy, education, construction, health care and tourism will also buoy economic growth over the medium term.",
      "Moody\u2019s said downside risks include cancellation of large investment project, a burgeoning public sector wage bill and spending pressures in health care."

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 01:22:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The last meatpackers in New York's Meatpacking District have agreed to end their leases early and make way for development on their city-owned lot",
    "story": [
      "The last meatpackers in New York's Meatpacking District have agreed to end their leases early and make way for development on their city-owned lot",
      "NEW YORK -- When John Jobbagy\u2019s grandfather immigrated from Budapest in 1900, he joined a throng of European butchers chopping up and shipping off meat in a loud, smelly corner of Manhattan that New Yorkers called the Meatpacking District.",
      "Today only a handful of meatpackers remain, and they're preparing to say goodbye to a very different neighborhood, known more for its high-end boutiques and expensive restaurants than the industry that gave it its name.",
      "Jobbagy and the other tenants in the district\u2019s last meat market have accepted a deal from the city to move out so the building can be redeveloped, the culmination of a decades-long transformation.",
      "\u201cThe neighborhood I grew up in is just all memories,\u201d said Jobbagy, 68. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone for over 20 years.\u201d",
      "In its heyday, it was a gritty hub of over 200 slaughterhouses and packing plants at the intersection of shipping and train lines, where meat and poultry were unloaded, cut and moved quickly to markets. Now the docks are recreation areas and an abandoned freight line is the High Line park. The Whitney Museum of American Art moved from Madison Avenue next to Jobbagy's meat company in 2015.",
      "Some of the new retailers maintain reminders of the neighborhood\u2019s meat-packing past. At the exposed brick entrance to an outlet of fashion brand Rag & Bone, which sells $300 leather belts, is a carefully restored sign from a previous occupant, \u201cDave\u2019s Quality Veal,\u201d in red and white hand-painted lettering.",
      "Another sign for a wholesale meat supplier appears on a long building awning outside Samsung\u2019s U.S. flagship phone store.",
      "But the neighborhood no longer sounds, smells or feels like the place where Jobbagy began working for his father in the late 1960s. He worked through high school and college summers before going into business for himself.",
      "Back then, meatpackers kept bottles of whiskey in their lockers to stay warm inside the refrigerated plants. Outside, \u201cit reeked,\u201d he said, especially on hot days near the poultry houses where chicken juices spilled into the streets.",
      "People only visited the neighborhood if they had business, usually transacting in handshake deals, he said.",
      "Slowly but surely, meatpacking plants began closing or moving out of Manhattan as advances in refrigeration and packaging enabled the meat industry to consolidate around packing plants in the Midwest, many of which can butcher and package more than 5,000 steers in a day and ship directly to supermarkets.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, a new nightlife scene emerged as bars and nightclubs moved in, many catering to the LGBTQ+ community. Sex clubs and slaughterhouses coexisted. And as the decades wore on, the drag queens and club kids began giving way to fashion designers and restaurateurs.",
      "By 2000, \u201cSex and The City\u201d character Samantha had left her Upper East Side apartment for a new home in the Meatpacking District. By the show's final 2003 season, she was outraged to see a Pottery Barn slated to open near a local leather bar.",
      "Another turning point came with the 2009 opening of the High Line, on a defunct rail track originally built in the 1930s. The popular greenway is now flanked by hotels, galleries and luxury apartment buildings.",
      "Jobbagy said his father died five years before the opening and would be baffled at what it looks like now.",
      "\u201cIf I told him that the elevated railroad was going to be turned into a public park, he never would have believed it,\u201d he said.",
      "But the area has changed constantly, noted Andrew Berman, executive director of local architectural preservation group Village Preservation.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t always a meatpacking district. It was a sort of wholesale produce district before that, and it was a shipping district before that,\" Berman said. In the early 1800s, Fort Gansevoort stood there. \"So it\u2019s had many lives and it\u2019s going to continue to have new lives.\u201d",
      "Though an exact eviction date for the last meat market has not been set, some of the other companies will relocate elsewhere.",
      "Not Jobbagy, who has held on by supplying high-end restaurants and the few retail stores that still want fresh hanging meat. He\u2019ll retire, along with his brother and his employees, most of them Latino immigrants who trained with him and saved up to buy second homes in Honduras, Mexico or the Dominican Republic. Some want to move to other industries, in other states.",
      "He expects to be the last meatpacker standing when the cleaver finally falls on Gansevoort Market.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be here when this building closes, when everybody, you know, moves on to something else,\" Jobbagy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I was part of it and I didn\u2019t leave before.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- Russia's third largest bank, Gazprombank and its six foreign subsidiaries were hit with U.S. sanctions on Thursday \u2014 in a move intended to curtail Russia's ability to evade the thousands of sanctions imposed on the nation since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s largest remaining non-sanctioned bank would further diminish Russia's military effort and \u201cwill make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.\u201d",
      "In addition, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials were hit with sanctions.",
      "The move comes after President Joe Biden this weekend authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war.",
      "In addition, on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that it will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. \u201cremains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia\u2019s war machine.\u201d",

      "Earlier rounds of sanctions spared Russian gas because Europe\u2019s economy was so dependent on it but Europe is now far less reliant on Russian gas, which is down to about 18% of imports. Russia cut off of most supplies in 2022, plunging the continent into an energy crisis.",
      "European governments and utilities have now lined up alternative supplies, much of it liquefied gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Ukraine says it will halt flows of Russian gas through a pipeline across Ukraine to Europe - about 4% of Europe\u2019s gas imports - at the end of the year. Gazprom recently cut off shipments through that pipeline to Austria\u2019s OMV in a commercial dispute; OMV has said it has plenty of reserves and can find alternative supply elsewhere. The EU has set a nonbinding goal of ending all Russian gas imports by 2027.",

      "Sneaking a little ahead of line to get on that plane faster",
      "NEW YORK -- Sneaking a little ahead of line to get on that plane faster? American Airlines might stop you.",
      "In an apparent effort to reduce the headaches caused by airport line cutting, American has rolled out boarding technology that alerts gate agents with an audible sound if a passenger tries to scan a ticket ahead of their assigned group. This new software won't accept a boarding pass before the group it's assigned to is called, so customers who get to the gate prematurely will be asked to go back and wait their turn.",
      "As of Wednesday, the airline announced, the technology is now being used in more than 100 U.S. airports that American flies out of. The official expansion arrives after successful tests in three of these locations \u2014 Albuquerque International Sunport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Tucson International Airport.",
      "The initial response from customers and American employees \"has exceeded our expectations,\" Julie Rath, American\u2019s senior vice president of airport operations, reservations and service recovery, said in a statement. She added that the airline is \u201cthrilled\" to have the technology up and running ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "American got lots of attention when it unveiled its gate-control testing last month. Analysts say that isn't surprising.",
      "It's no secret that line cutting in airports hits a nerve. Whether intentional or not, just about every air traveler has witnessed it, noted Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. It can add to frustrations in what can already be a tense environment, with particular anxiety around passengers wanting to sit together or rushing for some overhead bin space.",
      "Harteveldt doesn't see American's recent move as \u201cshaming\u201d customers who cut the line. \u201cWhat it is intended to do is bring order out of chaos,\u201d he said. \"And I hope it will defuse any potential flare ups of anger (from) people who simply think they're entitled to board out of turn .... It\u2019s just not fair.\"",
      "Harteveldt added that he thinks this change will enhance the experiences of both customers and gate agents. Others say more time will tell.",
      "Seth Miller, editor and founder of air travel experience analysis site PaxEx.aero, said he can see the benefits of more orderly and universal gate-control enforcement, particularly for airlines. But he said he isn't \u201c100% convinced this is perfect for passengers\" just yet.",
      "Families, for example, might be booked on several different reservations across more than one group, he said. Airlines typically have workarounds for that, and American noted Wednesday that customers traveling with a companion in an earlier group can simply have a gate agent \u201coverride the alert\u201d to continue boarding. Still, Miller said, \u201cyou have to go through the extra hoops.\u201d",
      "And a difficult customer still might choose to hold up the line and argue when they're not allowed to board, he added.",
      "Another question is whether customers who encounter a beep will walk away feeling embarrassed. But Harteveldt said he was happy to learn that American's alert is \u201cnot a bellowing sound that can be heard throughout the terminal,\u201d or accompanied by your name read over a loudspeaker, noting that this is important to avoid feelings of shame.",
      "Expanding this technology just a week before peak Thanksgiving travel could be \u201cboth good and bad,\u201d Harteveldt adds. On one hand, the tech could help significantly improve the boarding process during such a busy time, he said, but airport employees might also have appreciated more time to prepare.",
      "Both Miller and Harteveldt said they wouldn't be surprised if other carriers soon follow American's lead. Headaches over airport line cutting are far from new. While maybe not to the extent of American's new tech, Miller noted he's seen gate agents from other airlines ask people to leave a line and wait for their group. Harteveldt added that he's been to some airports in Asia and Europe with \u201csliding doors\u201d that ensure passengers are in the right group before boarding a plane.",
      "The more than 100 airports that American is now using its gate-control technology in are all spoke, or non-hub, locations \u2014 including Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The airline says it expects to further expand to its hubs and other airports in the coming months.",

      "Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take the any of the proposals,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cThe federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.\u201d",
      "One alternative would have the government act to \u201cprotect critical infrastructure\u201d including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. \u201cBut there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,\u201d the announcement said.",
      "A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with \u201cfederal and non-federal storage\u201d to boost system sustainability and flexibility \u201cthrough a new approach to distributing\u201d water during shortages.",
      "The third, dubbed \u201ccooperative conservation,\u201d cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid \u201cshared contributions to sustain system integrity.\"",
      "And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and \u201cafford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno action\u201d option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said.",
      "In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do.",
      "\u201cWe still have a pretty wide gap between us,\u201d Tom Buschatzke, Arizona\u2019s main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights.",
      "Buschatzke said he saw \u201csome really positive elements\u201d in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. \u201cI think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives \u201cunderscore how serious a situation we\u2019re facing on the Colorado River.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,\u201d he said. \"Otherwise, we\u2019ll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.\u201d",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas.",
      "Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said \u201csnapshots\u201d offered in the announcement \u201cunderscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement \u201cshows an expectation of continuity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,\u201d she said.",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "The Adani group had also been awarded a deal to construct power transmission lines in Kenya, East Africa's business hub.",

      "The Sixers issued a statement on the condition of the 2023 NBA MVP at halftime of Friday's NBA Cup game against the Brooklyn Nets, saying the decision to sideline Embiid was made along with the team's medical staff. Embiid was ruled out prior to Friday's game against the Nets due to what the team described as left knee injury maintenance. The Sixers host the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday.",
      "\u201cJoel Embiid is managing swelling in his left knee,\u201d the team's statement said. \u201cIn consultation with the team\u2019s medical staff, Embiid missed tonight\u2019s game and will also miss Sunday\u2019s game. He is receiving treatments and further updates on his status will be provided early next week.\u201d",
      "Embiid was originally listed as questionable in injury reports coming into the game and declared a game-time decision during coach Nick Nurse\u2019s pregame media session. But, Embiid never participated in warmups and was declared out 30 minutes before tip-off.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of something that we knew that we were going to be dealing with going into the season,\u201d Nurse after the team's 113-98 win over the Nets. \u201cThey do what they can do to remove that swelling, but it just didn\u2019t feel good enough to go.",
      "\u201cWe were pretty well aware not too much longer after (the pregame press conference) that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to go tonight and they looked at it again during the game or halftime or whatever and decided they need to treat it this weekend and go from there.\u201d",
      "Embiid was not in the locker room when reporters entered after the game Friday night.",
      "Embiid played Wednesday night in Memphis, scoring a season-high 35 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in a 117-111 loss that dropped the Sixers to 2-12. At times against the Grizzlies, Embiid appeared to be limping and hobbled with a knee injury, but remained in the game as Philadelphia battled back into contention in the fourth quarter.",
      "Embiid joined Paul George on the sidelines Friday night. George suffered a left knee bone bruise in Wednesday\u2019s game and will be out until next week, at the earliest. The third part of the Sixers\u2019 projected \u201cBig Three\u201d \u2014 guard Tyrese Maxey \u2014 returned against Memphis after missing two weeks with a hamstring injury. Embiid, Maxey and George have played together in just one game this season.",
      "Embiid missed Philadelphia\u2019s first 10 games due to knee management and a three-game suspension and has been sidelined for 11 of 15 games this season.",
      "The 30-year-old Embiid was limited to 39 games last season, mostly because of knee surgery after tearing the meniscus in his left knee on Jan. 30 against Golden State.",
      "Embiid, who helped the U.S. win gold in the Paris Olympics, signed a $193 million contract ahead of training camp and skipped the entire preseason.",

      "For a few early moments, he looked a little nervous. It was fleeting.",
      "Flagg scored 16 points in the second half, finishing with a game-high 24 as No. 12 Duke pulled away for a 69-55 win over No. 17 Arizona. The preseason All-American shot 10 of 22 from the field, grabbed six rebounds and had three assists, two blocks and a steal.",
      "\u201cIn the first half, I was a little soft on my finishes,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cIt was a high-level college basketball game, really physical. They're a physical team. But I found my footing and started playing off two feet a little better.\u201d",
      "Flagg \u2014 the nation's No. 1 overall recruit who wowed NBA stars in a workout against the U.S. Olympic Team this summer \u2014 is no stranger to high expectations. The 6-foot-9 forward has been very good in his first five career games, averaging 17.8 points.",
      "But a hostile crowd of this magnitude was something different. It'll be the first of many.",

      "Fellow freshman Kon Knueppel also had good moments late in the game, hitting two crucial 3-pointers. Knueppel finished with 13.",

      "\u201cHe's tall and athletic and can finish over a lot of bodies,\u201d Arizona's KJ Lewis said. \u201cI don't know. He's just super athletic. We did a good job containing him in the first half, but then we went away from the game plan, didn't communicate and he found openings.\u201d",

      "Recently retired Andy Murray will team up with Novak Djokovic, working with him as a coach through the Australian Open in January",
      "The recently retired Andy Murray is going to team up with longtime rival Novak Djokovic as his coach, they both announced Saturday, with plans to prepare for \u2014 and work together through \u2014 the Australian Open in January.",
      "It was a stunning bit of news as tennis moves toward its offseason, a pairing of two of the most successful and popular players in the sport, both of whom are sometimes referred to as members of a so-called Big Four that also included Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.",
      "Djokovic is a 24-time Grand Slam champion who has spent more weeks at No. 1 than any other player in tennis history. Murray won three major trophies and two Olympic singles gold medals and finished 2016 atop the ATP rankings. He ended his playing career after the Paris Summer Games in August.",
      "Both men are 37 and were born a week apart in May 1987. They started facing each other as juniors and wound up meeting 36 times as professionals, with Djokovic holding a 25-11 advantage.",
      "\u201cWe played each other since we were boys \u2014 25 years of being rivals, of pushing each other beyond our limits. We had some of the most epic battles in our sport. They called us game-changers, risk-takers, history-makers,\u201d Djokovic posted on social media over photos and videos from some of their matches. \u201cI thought our story may be over. Turns out, it has one final chapter. It\u2019s time for one of my toughest opponents to step into my corner. Welcome on board, Coach \u2014 Andy Murray.\u201d",
      "Djokovic's 2024 season is over, and it was not up to his usual, high standards. He didn't win a Grand Slam trophy; his only title, though, was meaningful to him: a gold medal for Serbia in singles at the Summer Games.",
      "Djokovic has been without a full-time coach since splitting in March from Goran Ivanisevic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be joining Novak\u2019s team in the offseason, helping him to prepare for the Australian Open,\" Murray said in a statement released by his management team. \"I\u2019m really excited for it and looking forward to spending time on the same side of the net as Novak for a change, helping him to achieve his goals.\u201d",

      "Djokovic beat Murray four times in the Australian Open final alone \u2014 in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016.",
      "Two of the most important victories of Murray's career came with Djokovic on the other side of the net. One was in the 2012 U.S. Open final, when Murray claimed his first Grand Slam title. The other was in the 2013 Wimbledon final, when Murray became the first British man in 77 years to win the singles championship at the All England Club.",

      "Now he used the street circuit to become only the sixth driver in F1 history to win at least four titles. Verstappen needed only to finish ahead of Norris to win the title. He started fifth but was already up to second by the 10th lap and Norris never challenged.",
      "He ended the race up 63 points over Norris with two events remaining this season \u2014 a position Verstappen said he never expected to be in even though he's the son of a former F1 driver. His father, Jos, was even once teammates with Michael Schumacher, one of the best in F1 history.",
      "Despite being surrounded by greatness, Verstappen insisted he never expected his own career to be so successful.",
      "\u201cWhen you're growing up racing some legendary drivers, it's very impressive that I can even be on the podium, whenever it is,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe win a championship? It's already hard enough to win one, and then of course, then you also need a bit of luck to be in the right team situation to maybe win more. Luckily, we did that.\u201d",

      "The race was won, meanwhile, by George Russell who was followed by Lewis Hamilton in the first 1-2 sweep for the Mercedes drivers since 2022. Hamilton came from 10th on the grid \u2014 two weeks after a demoralizing race in Brazil \u2014 to capture his podium finish.",

      "This was the second year of the race after its debut was a bit of a disaster with locals livid for months over ongoing construction, as well as traffic detours and delays, the inability to access many local businesses and outrageous price gouging by the tourism industry as well as LVGP ticketing. Then, a loose valve cover nearly destroyed Sainz's Ferrari minutes into the first practice.",
      "It caused an hours-long delay for repairs, fans were kicked out of the circuit, and F1 ran practice until 4 a.m. \u2014 when it legally had to reopen the streets to the public.",
      "This year has been far less hectic, in part because all of the infrastructure headaches were dealt with a year ago, but also that last year's race was spectacular. Despite all its speed bumps, the actual running of the race was one of the best of the F1 season.",

The announcement of the American team did not come during the weekend to avoid taking attention away from the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which is the showpiece event of the Liberty Media portfolio.",

      "Drew Bannister is out as coach of the St. Louis Blues after less than a full calendar year on the job. Jim Montgomery is back behind the bench of an NHL team five days after he was fired by the Boston Bruins.",
      "The Blues fired Bannister on Sunday and hired Montgomery as his replacement, a stunning move a quarter of the way through the NHL season that puts a seasoned coach in charge of shepherding St. Louis through a retooling period and into the potential re-opening of the organization's Stanley Cup-contending window.",
      "President and general manager Doug Armstrong said he did not anticipate making a change until Montgomery became a free agent.",
      "\u201cThis was more of an opportunity to get someone of Jim\u2019s caliber than anything else,\u201d Armstrong said on a video call with reporters. \u201cWhen I talked to Drew today I told him this was more of a decision based on the availability of someone I think is a top NHL coach, someone that we have experience with, someone I really do believe can coach this team and also coach the team when it reaches its ultimate level of competitiveness.\"",
      "Armstrong showed no hesitation in cutting ties with Bannister, who had the interim tag removed from his title and became the full-time coach in May. Bannister was promoted from Springfield of the American Hockey League to replace 2019 Cup-winning coach Craig Berube last December, and the Blues missed the playoffs despite winning 30 of their final 54 games.",
      "The Blues lost 13 of their first 22 games this season. Only two teams have scored fewer than their 2.36 goals a game, and they rank in the bottom third of the league on the power play and penalty kill while ravaged by injuries.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy situation for him to walk into,\u201d Armstrong said, adding he felt Bannister was learning on the fly as a first-time NHL head coach. \u201cHe was making mistakes. We were all making mistakes. ... I was more than willing to go through the peaks and valleys with Drew until Monty became available.\u201d",
      "Montgomery, 55, is tasked with getting the most out of the talent available, something he has accomplished elsewhere. Every team he has coached for a full season has qualified for the playoffs, and his .659 points percentage ranks among the best in NHL history.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got a wealth of experience, and he\u2019s at really the prime of his coaching career,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cHe\u2019s the full package, or at least we hope he\u2019s the full package.\u201d",
      "The Bruins opted to move on from Montgomery after their rough start, going 8-9-3, with the final defeat being a 5-1 home loss to Columbus. Boston won 120 of 184 regular-season games with Montgomery running the show, including setting the league records for victories and points in 2021-22 when he was the obvious choice for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year.",
      "His second act as a head coach in the NHL came after Montgomery's first ended abruptly. Hired by the Dallas Stars in 2018, he led them to the second round and then was fired in December 2019 for unprofessional conduct.",
      "Montgomery called his dismissal appropriate, entered rehab and began putting his life back together.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s obviously gone through things at the rink and away from the rink that defined who he is today,\u201d Armstrong said.",
      "Montgomery got his re-entry into hockey from the Blues, with Armstrong hiring Montgomery as an assistant on Berube's staff in September 2020. That was the first sign of the longtime executive's affinity for Montgomery, and the latest comes with job security. St. Louis signed him to a five-year contract.",
      "Montgomery is the latest coach to be fired and re-hired midseason, a more common occurrence in the NHL than most professional sports leagues. Being out of a job for mere days is reminiscent of Bruce Boudreau's experience in 2011, when he was fired by Washington on a Monday morning and replaced Randy Carlyle in Anaheim later that week.",
      "This is the 23rd coaching change among the league's 32 teams since January 2023, with the Blues among those making multiple moves in that time.",
      "\u201cA coach that I believe is a difference-maker became available, and we reacted to it,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe have a top-level NHL coach, and now it\u2019s time for all of us to do our jobs and support him.\u201d",

    "title": "When Harbaugh brothers meet for 3rd time Monday, Archie Manning can relate to Jack Harbaugh",
    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 15:22:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Archie Manning can empathize with what Jack Harbaugh will be going through again on Monday night",
    "story": [
      "Archie Manning can empathize with what Jack Harbaugh will be going through again on Monday night",
      "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Archie Manning can empathize with what Jack Harbaugh will be going through again on Monday night.",
      "For the first time in 11 years, the 85-year-old patriarch of the Harbaugh family has to be a neutral observer with Jim\u2019s Los Angeles Chargers hosting John\u2019s Baltimore Ravens in the third matchup between the coaching brothers.",
      "Manning, more than anyone, knows the attention and conflicting emotions of these games. He had to go through it three times when his sons, quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, faced off. Peyton won all three meetings over Eli and the New York Giants, first with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 and \u201910, and then with the Denver Broncos in 2013.",
      "At least Manning and his wife, Olivia, had something to root for during those games \u2014 the offenses of both teams their sons were leading. Jack and Jackie Harbaugh can\u2019t get that since the head coaches are responsible for all the players.",
      "\"The first thing is you\u2019re proud because it is pretty unique. The second thing is, you don\u2019t like it,\" Archie Manning said during a phone call. \"You\u2019re proud that both are in the National Football League, but you just assume it wouldn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t fun. I guess we were lucky it happened only three times. Heck, they could have been in the same division and done it 20 times.\"",
      "Jack Harbaugh didn\u2019t do interviews this week. He said that, leading up to Super Bowl 47, he appreciated hearing from Manning before it happened the first time in 2011 when Jim\u2019s San Francisco 49ers visited John\u2019s Baltimore squad.",
      "The Ravens won that game 16-6. John received even more bragging rights the following season after the Ravens\u2019 34-31 victory in New Orleans on Feb. 3, 2013, on football\u2019s ultimate stage.",
      "Before the first \u201cHarbaugh Bowl,\u201d Archie Manning offered Jack Harbaugh some advice \u2014 \u201cIt will be over soon enough.\u201d",
      "Jack and Jackie Harbaugh attended the first two meetings, but will not be at Monday\u2019s game. Instead, they will be at their daughter Joanie\u2019s house in Bradenton, Florida, for Thanksgiving and to celebrate their 63rd wedding anniversary.",
      "Chargers defensive analyst Rick Minter went up against Jack Harbaugh before getting to coach with both sons. John Harbaugh was on Minter\u2019s staff at the University of Cincinnati and has been on Jim Harbaugh\u2019s staffs at Michigan and the Chargers when his son, Jesse, was hired as defensive coordinator.",
      "\u201cBoth sons are so tuned into their father with great respect. He\u2019s passed (the game) down in so many ways to them, but they still look to him for advice,\u201d Minter said. \u201cJack still does it where he watches game films (of the Ravens and Chargers) and writes up reports.",
      "\u201cJack is a crowd-pleasing speaker. He\u2019s excitable and emotional, and he brings it out and gets his message across. I don\u2019t know if Jack and John are either one. They are more modern, less authoritative and more connective, collaborative and well-spoken and all those types of things.\u201d",
      "The Harbaughs, though, aren\u2019t the only connections in this matchup. Five assistant coaches on Jim Harbaugh\u2019s staff \u2014 including offensive coordinator Greg Roman and Jesse Minter \u2014 also coached for John Harbaugh in Baltimore.",
      "Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz spent 26 seasons in the Ravens front office before coming to Los Angeles when Jim Harbaugh returned to the NFL earlier this year.",
      "Roman, who has been an assistant for Jim Harbaugh for seven years at Stanford, San Francisco, and the Chargers, along with five seasons with John Harbaugh in Baltimore, said the feeling going into Monday night has been the same as any other game on the schedule.",
      "Roman was asked again this past week to point out the differences between the two brothers, but he pointed out the similarities.",
      "\u201cI learned a lot from both of them. Every brother and sister, everybody\u2019s different, you know. So it\u2019s an interesting juxtaposition if you will,\u201d he said. \u201cBut very similar in a lot of ways and just a little different nuances with each. But they\u2019re very strong leaders.\u201d",
      "Six players, including running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, are also former Ravens. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy was with the Chargers during the 2022 season, while backup quarterback Josh Johnson (San Diego) and outside linebacker David Ojabo (Michigan) played for Jim Harbaugh in college.",
      "The Chargers (7-3) have a four-game winning streak.",
      "The Ravens (7-4) entered the weekend trailing the Steelers by a game in the AFC North and also can\u2019t afford to fall behind in the wild-card race.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different but fun because it is two similar type ballclubs hashing it out,\u201d said Chargers safety and former Raven Tony Jefferson. \u201cIt is two physical teams on both sides of the ball and dynamic players at quarterback. It lines up to be a good matchup, and that\u2019s what you strive for in games, especially prime time.\u201d",

      "DJ Lagway threw two touchdown passes, Montrell Johnson ran for 127 yards and a score, and Florida upset No. 9 Mississippi 24-17 on Saturday to knock the Rebels out of College Football Playoff contention",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Coach Billy Napier and his team did something no one at Florida had done in nearly two decades. It could be the turning point for a once-proud program that clearly slipped in recent years.",
      "DJ Lagway threw two touchdown passes, Montrell Johnson ran for 127 yards and a score, and the Gators upset No. 9 Mississippi 24-17 on Saturday to knock the Rebels out of College Football Playoff contention.",
      "Florida (6-5, 4-4 Southeastern Conference), which topped LSU last Saturday in the Swamp, beat ranked teams in consecutive weeks for the first time since 2008.",
      "\u201cWe're just getting started,\u201d said Napier, who is expected back for a fourth season in 2025. \u201cThis is part of the big-picture journey. Belief is the most powerful thing in the world.\"",
      "Ole Miss (8-3, 4-3), which was a 10-point favorite, lost for the first time in four games and will drop out of the 12-team playoff picture. The Rebels ranked ninth in the latest CFP and needed only to avoid a letdown against Florida and lowly Mississippi State to clinch a spot in the playoff field.",
      "\u201cObviously a lot was at stake, and we didn\u2019t come through,\" coach Lane Kiffin said. \"A lot of missed opportunities.\u201d",
      "The Rebels failed to score in three trips inside the red zone and dropped countless passes in perfect weather, miscues Kiffin called \u201cvery unusual.\u201d",
      "Still, Ole Miss had chances late. But Jaxson Dart threw interceptions to end the team's last two drives. Bryce Thornton, beaten for a touchdown in the first half, picked off both. The second one came with 17 seconds remaining and set up a raucous celebration by defenders in the end zone.",
      "Dart completed 24 of 41 passes for 323 yards, with two TDs and the two picks. He was sacked four times and also scrambled 14 times for a team-high 71 yards.",
      "\u201cYou look at the way we played, we had a chip on our shoulder for sure,\" defensive tackle Cam Jackson said.",
      "The Rebels probably would have had a comfortable lead had it not been for repeated failures inside the 20-yard line. Defensive tackle J.J. Pegues, a 325-pound wrecking ball out of the backfield, was stopped on two fourth-down runs inside the 20-yard line, and Caden Davis missed a 34-yard field goal in the second quarter.",
      "Ole Miss' drops were egregious, including at least three that probably would have been touchdowns. Jordan Watkins (twice), Wells (twice), Dae\u2019Quan Wright and star receiver Tre Harris were among the droppers.",
      "Florida was much more efficient. Lagway completed 10 of 17 passes for 180 yards, with an interception. He made three throws with defenders draped all over him.",
      "\u201cThose were the plays of the game,\u201d Napier said.",
      "Johnson had a few of those, too. His 9-yard scoring run from the wildcat formation was huge and came after missed most of the last four games.",
      "\u201cI focused on grinding and trying to work my way back,\" Johnson said. \"Last week I got a couple carries and this week I shot to the moon.\u201d",
      "Days after Kiffin raved about the health of his team, the Rebels had three starters go down with injuries.",
      "Harris, returning after missing the last three games with a strained groin, re-injured it the second quarter and did not return.",
      "Safety Yam Banks also was carted off the field after injuring his left knee, and center Reece McIntyre left the game. Right tackle Micah Pettus also was injured on a play but was able to return.",
      "Injured quarterback Graham Mertz got the loudest ovation during Florida\u2019s senior day. Mertz\u2019s college career ended when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during a 23-17 overtime loss at then-No. 8 Tennessee last month.",
      "The graduating class also includes Johnson, defensive tackle Desmond Watson and cornerback Jason Marshall, who also is out for the season.",
      "Mississippi: The Rebels needed better offensive balance. Playing without running back Henry Parrish Jr. (knee) for the second consecutive game, Ole Miss threw the ball 41 times. Dart also scrambled 14 more. It worked at times against Florida\u2019s depleted secondary but wasn't a recipe for success.",
      "Florida: The Gators now have a chance to close the regular season with three consecutive wins, more proof that Napier has the team on the right track.",
      "Mississippi: The Rebels host Mississippi State in a rivalry known as the Egg Bowl on Friday.",

But come qualifying, the seven-time Formula 1 champion made two mistakes in the final group and wound up a distant 10th as Russell will lead the field to green in Saturday night's race.",
      "\u201cThe car was feeling great today, and it has been a good weekend up to the final segment of qualifying,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI had two bad laps in Q3 and that left us P10. I didn\u2019t get the job done. It\u2019s really disappointing as we definitely had the pace for pole position. It will be difficult starting from where we are in P10, but I will try and get up to the podium.\u201d",
      "Russell snagged the top starting spot at the buzzer after Ferrari drivers Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc seemed to sweep the front row. Russell's late lap then pushed Sainz to second, Pierre Gasly slid into third, and Leclerc wound up fourth.",
      "\u201cThat was a tight quali, a bit closer to pole than what I was expecting, I thought I had pole and then George came very, very quick at the end,\u201d Sainz said. \u201cWe need to stay confident that tomorrow we could be fighting closer to the front even more than today so that tomorrow we might have a chance at going for the win and that will be the target.\u201d",
      "Championship leader Max Verstappen of Red Bull qualified fifth. Verstappen needs only to score three points more than challenger Lando Norris on Saturday night to win his fourth consecutive world championship, and the McLaren driver qualified sixth.",
      "Verstappen had struggled for much of the weekend as Red Bull used an incorrect setup on the rear wings of its two cars but claimed the issues had been corrected in time for qualifying.",
      "\"The day started off quite tough but we did our best and maximized everything that we could,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cWe did execute everything really well in qualifying and worked well as a team. I am ultimately happy with how it went \u2014 I left everything out there and we ended up in P5. Everything looks a lot better than yesterday and hopefully with the things that we changed on the car, we are a bit more competitive tomorrow in the race.\u201d",
      "Norris was displeased to be behind his title rival for the start.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling all weekend \u2014 we\u2019ve not had the pace of some of our competitors, and things didn\u2019t come together in qualifying,\u201d Norris said. \"It was just too difficult to do a perfect lap. It\u2019ll be difficult tomorrow, but it\u2019s a long race, so we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d",
      "The fix on the Red Bull wing didn't help Verstappen teammate Sergio Perez, who was knocked out of the first group of qualifying for the sixth time this season and will start 16th on Saturday night in Red Bull's uphill fight to remain in the race for the constructor championship. The two-time reigning constructor winners are third in the standings with three races remaining.",
      "\u201cUnbelievable, it doesn't get any better,\u201d Perez said on his radio. \u201cI can't find any grip.\u201d",
      "He later said Las Vegas has been a struggle for Red Bull.",
      "\u201cThe whole weekend I've been struggling quite a lot with the grip. It is really hard to put a lap together,\u201d he said. \u201cI did expect a very difficult qualifying and it turned out to be quite a tough one.\u201d",
      "Franco Colapinto, one of the drivers sometimes mentioned as a possible replacement at Red Bull for Perez, had his own miserable qualifying session when he crashed hard into the wall as the second qualifying group came to a close. The contact completely destroyed his Williams less than 24 hours before the start of the race and it was unclear if the Argentine could even compete.",
      "Williams said Calapinto's impact was over 50Gs, which required both a Friday night medical check but a Saturday follow, as well. The team said Calapinto will have to be medically cleared to race.",
      "The crash delayed the start of the the third session and was also another mistake for the 21-year-old Colapinto. He also crashed during the last race at Brazil when, running 16th, he crashed coming onto the main straight as the field was under safety car conditions due to rain.",
      "Although unhurt, the incident cost Williams millions of dollars in damage and the Las Vegas crash only added to the growing total. Colapinto was a midseason replacement for Logan Sargeant, who was fired for underperforming, and will be replaced at Williams next year by Sainz.",
      "He'd overperformed in two of his six races with the team by finishing in the points, but the former F2 driver is now hurting his chances to land an F1 seat in 2025.",
      "Williams took a second hit when Alex Albon also failed to advance out of the first qualifying group.",

      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

      "Using drones and Google Earth imagery, archaeologists have discovered a 4,000-year-old network of earthen canals in what\u2019s now Belize",
      "WASHINGTON -- Long before the ancient Maya built temples, their predecessors were already altering the landscape of Central America\u2019s Yucatan peninsula.",
      "Using drones and Google Earth imagery, archaeologists have discovered a 4,000-year-old network of earthen canals in what\u2019s now Belize. The findings were published Friday in Science Advances.",
      "\u201cThe aerial imagery was crucial to identify this really distinctive pattern of zigzag linear canals\u201d running for several miles through wetlands, said study co-author Eleanor Harrison-Buck of the University of New Hampshire.",
      "The team then conducted digs in Belize's Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. The ancient fish canals, paired with holding ponds, were used to channel and catch freshwater species such as catfish.",
      "\u201cBarbed spearpoints\u201d found nearby may have been tied to sticks and used to spear fish, said study co-author Marieka Brouwer Burg of the University of Vermont.",
      "The canal networks were built as early as 4,000 years ago by semi-nomadic people in the Yucatan coastal plain. According to the study, the canals were used for around 1,000 years or longer, including during the \u201cformative\u201d period when the Maya began to settle in permanent farming villages and a distinctive culture started to emerge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see such large-scale modifications of the landscape so early \u2014 it shows people were already building things,\u201d said University of Pittsburgh archaeologist Claire Ebert, who was not involved in the study.",
      "At the height of Maya civilization, people in this region built temples, roads, pyramids and other monuments. They also developed complex systems of writing, mathematics and astronomy. Scientists know far more about this era because there are many more significant archaeological sites, said Ebert.",
      "But this new study reveals a link between the earlier people on the landscape and the later emergence of Maya culture. These ancient channels for catching fish may have played a role in helping later Maya pyramids rise above the Yucatan rainforest.",
      "\u201cThis shows continuity,\" said University of Pennsylvania archaeologist Jeremy Sabloff, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "On a practical level, the fish-trapping canals helped the early people in the region to diversify their diets and feed a growing population, building a foundation for later cultural heights.",

      "LONDON -- Looking for a new social media platform because X, Threads and Mastodon just aren't cutting it? You could try Bluesky.",
      "People seeking to avoid chaos, noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the U.S. elections are noticing a different mood on the Bluesky social platform, where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls.",
      "The site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after Election Day, and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk\u2019s X and similar platforms.",
      "If you're tempted to check out the new space, here's a guide on how Bluesky works:",
      "Maybe you're not ready to commit to adding yet another social media account. No problem \u2014 you can still look around on Bluesky without signing up because all posts and profiles are public.",
      "You might get a sense of deja vu because the platform's look and feel are very similar to X. That should be no surprise because Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was an early Bluesky champion. (Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.)",
      "If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social.",
      "You can personalize your handle to make it more memorable, by using your own website's domain or buying a custom one through Bluesky. But it might not be something most newbie users need or want to do right away.",
      "Bluesky boasts that it gives users \u201calgorithmic choice\u201d to tailor the content they're shown instead of leaving it up to the whims of a centralized system.",
      "\u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,\u201d it says.",
      "What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button.",
      "There's also the usual \u201cDiscover\u201d feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow.",
      "To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don\u2019t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online.",
      "Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians. You can follow the whole pack or scroll down the list to choose individual accounts.",
      "What about people you followed on X? There's a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who've migrated to Bluesky. But check before clicking the follow button to make sure it's not a different user using the same display name or handle.",
      "Ready to join the conversation? You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there's a limit of 300 characters \u2014 20 more than on X. You can also upload photos and videos, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are, of course, available too.",
      "You can still @ people by typing in their username, like posts by tapping a heart icon or use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a menu to hashtags, so when you click on one you'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on that topic.",
      "Bluesky's decentralization ethos extends to the content control options it offers.",
      "For starters, users can choose in their settings menu whether to see replies, reposts or quote posts in their feed. Specific words or tags can be muted temporarily, or forever, while accounts can be muted or blocked individually, or in bulk by adding them a moderation list. You can even fine tune the level of adult content that shows up in your feed.",
      "Bluesky has a team of content moderators to police the site for material that's illegal or breaks the rules. But it's also taking a different approach by open sourcing its content moderation system in an attempt to resolve problems with traditional moderation services which it says \u201clack transparency and user control.\u201d",
      "So, individuals or groups can set up their own content filters, or labelers, that go beyond what Bluesky offers. These labelers can be used to categorize content or users, which can then be blocked or hidden. But they could also be used for informational or creative purposes, like curating or verifying content.",
      "There are labelers to identify images generated by artificial intelligence or to fact check news posts. You can find lists of labelers online. After I subscribed to a U.S. politics labeler, some posts in my feeds were flagged \u201c!Donald Trump\u201d or \u201c!Democrat politician\u201d and hidden unless I click Show.",

      "\u201cWe remain committed to the responsible use of our technologies, which are exclusively provided to government agencies for the prevention of serious crimes and terrorism,\u201d spokesperson Gil Lainer said in an email to The Associated Press. \"NSO operates under strict regulatory frameworks and ethical standards, and we will continue to cooperate with authorities to ensure our products are used lawfully and effectively.\u201d",

      "Other activists alleged that Thai government agencies were behind the use of Pegasus, but officials have not commented directly on it.

      "\u201cHowever it won\u2019t deter the fight against the unlawful use of spyware and the fight for justice for the victims of spyware in Thailand and around the world,\" the rights group said in a statement.",

      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but the large majority of daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",

      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, recently pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "How of this will actually pan out \u2014 and whether or not Trump will successfully act quickly on these promises \u2014 has yet to be seen.",
      "\u201cThis is not necessarily a short-term story, it\u2019s likely a much longer-term story,\" Citi macro strategist David Glass told The Associated Press last week. \"And there is the question of how quickly can U.S. crypto policy make a serious impact on (wider adoption).\u201d",

      "Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, thinks the industry is craving \u201cjust some sort of clarity.\u201d Much of the approach to regulating crypto in the past has been \u201cenforcement based,\u201d he notes, which has been helpful in weeding out some bad actors \u2014 but legislation might fill in other key gaps.",
      "Despite crypto\u2019s recent excitement around Trump, McCarthy said that 2024 has already been a \u201chugely consequential year for regulation in the U.S.\u201d \u2014 pointing to January\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, which mark a new way to invest in the asset.",
      "Spot ETFs have been the dominant driver of bitcoin for some time now \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. According to Kaiko, bitcoin ETFs recorded $6 billion in trade volume for the week of the election alone.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. In theory, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term. Others note it may be too early to tell.",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. But experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. And lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could mean less guardrails.",
      "\u201cI would say, keep it simple. And don\u2019t take on more risk than you can afford to,\" McCarthy said \u2014 adding that there isn't a \u201cmagic eight ball\u201d to know for certain what comes next.",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\u201d which consumes a lot of energy. Operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "A volcano on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwestern Iceland is spewing lava from a fissure in its seventh eruption since December",
      "GRINDAVIK, Iceland -- A volcano in southwestern Iceland that has roared back to life after eight centuries of silence has erupted for the seventh time since December, sending molten lava flowing towards the Blue Lagoon spa, a major tourist attraction.",
      "The eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. (2314 GMT) Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, according to Iceland\u2019s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity.",
      "Most of the previous eruptions have subsided within days.",
      "\u201cIn the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi Gu\u00f0mundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told national broadcaster RUV.",
      "While the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindav\u00edk, which was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.",
      "Around 50 houses were evacuated after the Civil Protection agency issued the alert, along with guests at the Blue Lagoon By Thursday afternoon lava had spread across parking lot of the geothermal spa, one of Iceland's biggest tourist attractions, consuming a service building.",
      "Lava also reached the pipeline that supplies the peninsula with hot water for heating, the meteorological office said, though the pipes were built to withstand lava flow.",
      "The repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindav\u00edk, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and had a population before the eruptions of 3,800, have damaged infrastructure and property, forcing many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety.",
      "\u201cGrindav\u00edk is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi said.",
      "Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.",

      "The U.S. leads the world in developing artificial intelligence technology, surpassing China in research and other important measures of AI innovation, according to a newly released Stanford University index.",
      "There's no surefire way to rank global AI leadership but Stanford researchers have made an attempt by measuring the \u201cvibrancy\u201d of the AI industry across various dimensions, from how much research and investment is happening to how responsibly the technology is being pursued to prevent harm.",
      "\u201cThe gap is actually widening\u201d between the U.S. and China, said computer scientist Ray Perrault, director of the steering committee that runs Stanford's AI Index. \u201cThe U.S. is investing a lot more, at least at the level of firm creation and firm funding.\u201d",
      "The California-based university's Institute for Human-Centered AI \u2014 which has ties to Silicon Valley's tech industry \u2014 released the report Thursday as government AI officials from the U.S. and several allies met in San Francisco this week to compare notes on AI safety measures.",
      "Here's which countries made the top 10:",
      "The U.S. ranks No. 1 on Stanford's list and has consistently held that position since 2018 when it overtook China. It has far outpaced China in private AI investment, which hit $67.2 billion in the U.S. last year compared to $7.8 billion in China, according to the report. It also leads in publishing responsible AI research. It's no surprise that the home of commercial AI powerhouses such as Google and Meta, along with relative newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, has produced many notable AI models that have influenced how the technology is being developed and applied. The U.S. also gets some points for having a number of AI-related laws on the books, though Congress has yet to pass any broad AI regulations.",
      "China has requested far more patents than any other country regarding generative AI, the U.N. intellectual property agency said earlier this year. Stanford researchers counted that as one measure of China's strong growth in AI innovation but not enough to lead the pack. Still, the report says that \"China\u2019s focus on developing cutting-edge AI technologies and increasing its R&D investments has positioned it as a major AI powerhouse.\u201d China's universities have produced a large number of AI-related research publications and it has commercial leaders developing notable AI models, such as Baidu and its chatbot Ernie.",
      "Coming in at No. 3 is the UK, which also ranked high in research and development, and educational infrastructure due to top computer science universities churning out a skilled AI workforce. It's also home to Google's AI subsidiary DeepMind, whose co-founder recently won a Nobel Prize; and \u201chad more mentions of AI in parliamentary proceedings\u201d than any other country. Last year, the UK hosted the world\u2019s first international AI safety summit.",
      "Close behind the UK was India, thanks to a \u201cstrong AI research community,\u201d improvements in economic investments tied to AI and a robust public discourse about AI on social media, according to the report.",
      "The UAE's deliberate focus on AI appears to have paid off in the Middle Eastern nation's fifth-place score. It was one of the top locations for AI investments. Microsoft earlier this year said it was investing $1.5 billion in UAE-based tech firm G42, which is overseen by the country\u2019s powerful national security adviser. Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers and has built what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 are France at No. 6, followed by South Korea, Germany, Japan and Singapore. France, home to the buzzy AI startup Mistral, ranked high in AI policy and governance. Both it and Germany are part of the European Union's sweeping new AI Act that places safeguards on a range of AI applications based on how risky they are. The EU also follows the U.S. in developing a plan to expand semiconductor production within the bloc.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

      "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly",
      "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade.",
      "The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels.",
      "Here's what it all means:",
      "Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's \u201cwildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. \u201cIt would break a range of Google products \u2014 even beyond search \u2014 that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency\u2019s antitrust division.",
      "Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work.",
      "Justice lawyers called Chrome a \u201cgateway to the internet\u201d that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.",
      "Chrome also is included in the set of apps bundled with Android on phones as part of a mobile device ecosystem that regulators say gives Google a big edge.",
      "Chrome is the world\u2019s most popular mobile web browser, with about 67% adoption globally, according to StatCounter. Apple\u2019s Safari browser has the next highest adoption at 18%.",
      "Although it could be years before we see any practical effects of this case on the market, it could mean users would see more search engine options when selecting a default one to use on their favored devices.",
      "While federal regulators aren't going as far as to demand Google spin off Android, they are leaving the door open.",
      "The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google\u2019s own general search services.",
      "Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market.",
      "Android is the world's most popular smartphone operating system, found on 71% of mobile phones, Statcounter says. It\u2019s free to use, so many devices by Samsung and many other tech companies \u2014 aside from Apple \u2014 have it pre-installed.",
      "The Justice Department outlined a range of behavioral measures to give rival search engines a better chance at competing with Google.",
      "The core remedy is a ban on Google from cutting deals worth billions of dollars to lock in its search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other popular devices. This could potentially impact the bottom line at companies receiving such packages.",
      "Other key recommendations:",
      "1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",

      "4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",
      "Google has the chance to submit its own list of proposed fixes in December, and federal regulators will file a revised version of their proposals in early March. Court hearings on these proposed measures are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision before Labor Day.",
      "The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration takes over from Biden in January and assumes oversight of the Department of Justice, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues.",
      "Although Trump has made comments suggesting a breakup of Google isn't in the U.S. national interest, recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies. And the case was originally filed during Trump's first term, which suggests Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Google is expected to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia was released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach, officials said Friday.",
      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state\u2019s most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\u201cI really didn\u2019t know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\u201d Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird\u2019s release but released by the government on Friday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll miss Gus. It\u2019s been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn\u2019t have missed,\u201d she added.",
      "Biddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They\u2019re social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Gus gained weight in her care, from 21.3 kilograms (47 pounds) when he was found to 24.7 kilograms (54 pounds). He stands 1 meter (39 inches) tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is further south than Western Australia.",
      "The government said with the Southern Hemisphere summer approaching, it had been time-crucial to return Gus to the ocean where he could thermoregulate.",
      "Emperor penguins have been known to cover up to 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) on foraging journeys that last up to a month, the government said."

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:26:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "A sale of Chrome \u201cwill permanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,\u201d Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.",
      "Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct.",
      "The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist.",
      "The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.",
      "Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people\u2019s queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.",
      "Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing \u201ca radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America\u2019s global technology.\u201d In a blog post, Walker warned the \u201coverly broad proposal\u201d would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google\u2019s early leadership in artificial intelligence, \u201cperhaps the most important innovation of our time.\u201d",
      "Wary of Google\u2019s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google\u2019s AI training techniques.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump\u2019s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn\u2019t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. \u201cWhat you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\u201d Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year\u2019s trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta\u2019s ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department\u2019s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google, and the recommendation that Android should be completely walled off from the company's own search engine.",
      "\u201cIt is probably going a little beyond,\u201d Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. \u201cThe remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.\u201d",
      "Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist.",
      "\u201cUndoing Google\u2019s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,\u201d Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "LONDON -- Apple and Google aren't giving consumers a genuine choice of mobile web browsers, a British watchdog said Friday in a report that recommends they face an investigation under new U.K. digital rules taking effect next year.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority took aim at Apple, saying the iPhone maker's tactics hold back innovation by stopping rivals from giving users new features like faster webpage loading. Apple does this by restricting progressive web apps, which don't need to be downloaded from an app store and aren't subject to app store commissions, the report said.",
      "\u201cThis technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,\u201d the watchdog said in a provisional report on its investigation into mobile browsers that it opened after an initial study concluded that Apple and Google effectively have a chokehold on \u201cmobile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "The CMA's report also found that Apple and Google manipulate the choices given to mobile phone users to make their own browsers \u201cthe clearest or easiest option.\u201d",
      "And it said that the a revenue-sharing deal between the two U.S. Big Tech companies \u201csignificantly reduces their financial incentives\u201d to compete in mobile browsers on Apple's iOS operating system for iPhones.",
      "Both companies said they will \u201cengage constructively\u201d with the CMA.",
      "Apple said it disagreed with the findings and said it was concerned that the recommendations would undermine user privacy and security.",
      "Google said the openness of its Android mobile operating system \u201chas helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps\" and that it's \u201ccommitted to open platforms that empower consumers.\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to crack down on the dominance of Big Tech companies. U.S. federal prosecutors this week unveiled their proposals to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser as they target its monopoly in online search.",
      "The CMA's final report is due by March. The watchdog indicated it would recommend using the U.K.'s new digital competition rulebook set to take effect next year, which includes new powers to rein in tech companies, to prioritize further investigation into Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s \u201cactivities in mobile ecosystems.\""

    "story": [
      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

      "However, others besides Gaetz have been hit with scandal.",
      "Kennedy has been a prominent vaccine skeptic and supported abortion access, riling anti-abortion groups allied with Trump. Gabbard has blamed the U.S. and NATO for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. And Hegseth is mired in a sexual misconduct controversy over payments to a woman who alleges he assaulted her at a conference.",
      "With Gaetz out of the running, the spotlight has mostly shifted to Hegseth, who has also ruffled feathers by saying that he doesn't agree that women should serve in combat roles in the military.",
      "Hagerty praised Hegseth and insisted that the Trump transition team has thoroughly vetted all of its candidates -- but that he isn't concerned with who does a formal background check on them before the confirmation process formally begins.",
      "\"Don't let these allegations distract us. What we need is real significant change. The Pentagon has been more focused on pronouns than they have lethality the past four years. We need to get back to business, and I think Pete is just the person to do it,\" Hagerty said.",
      "\"The transition team has been working for months to prepare for this. I'm certain that there was significant vetting that has taken place, it has for every candidate,\" Hagerty added.",
      "FBI background checks have been standard practice for nominees requiring Senate confirmation, but the Trump transition team has yet to sign the necessary agreements to allow such screenings to occur.",
      "However, while some Republican senators have said they'd like to see an FBI background check done on Hegseth, Hagerty said, \"I don't think the American public cares who does the background checks. What the American public cares about is to see the mandate that they voted in delivered upon.\"",
      "Hagerty also said that he supports the use of recess appointments -- allowing Trump to temporarily put Cabinet picks in office while Congress is out of session -- though he did demur when pressed by Karl over whether Trump would do so if the person lacked sufficient Republican support to be confirmed in the Senate.",
      "\"I haven't spoken with President Trump about the specific plans. What he wants to do is see these appointments made quickly. He wants to see us get through the confirmation process. And again, I think everything should be on the table,\" he said.",

      "LONDON -- Ukraine's air force said that at least 73 Russian attack drones entered the country's airspace on Saturday into Sunday morning, after a week in which both sides made battlefield history with new advanced weapons systems.",
      "Ukraine's air force said it downed 50 of the 73 Russian drones that crossed into the country. Another 19 drones were lost in flight, while four more were still flying in Ukrainian airspace as of just after 7 a.m. local time.",

      "The ministry said its own strikes were part of a wider campaign of attacks on \"military airfields, production facilities and storage sites for drones, as well as concentrations of enemy manpower and military equipment.\"",
      "Drone exchanges have been a constant element of Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor, with the size and regularity increasing as the war wears on. Russia also often combines its UAV barrages with missile strikes.",
      "\"This week, the air alert sounded almost every day throughout Ukraine,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram early Sunday.",

      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \u201cChuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\u201d Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV\u2019s \u201cLove Connection,\u201d for which he coined the phrase, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\u201d a two-fingered signature dubbed the \u201c2 and 2.\u201d In 1984, he hosted TV\u2019s \u201cScrabble,\u201d simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\u201cLove Connection,\u201d which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest\u2019s choice, \u201cLove Connection\u201d would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, \u2018I remember wagon trains.\u2019 The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\u201d",

In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV\u2019s \u201cMelrose Place.\u201d",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network\u2019s first attempt at a reality show, \u201cChuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\u201d which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d debuted Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d started life as \u201cShopper\u2019s Bazaar,\u201d incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show\u201d singing \u201cDelta Dawn,\u201d Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\u201cI had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\u201d Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \u201cAfter the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, \u2018Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn\u2019t care what you have to say \u2014 that\u2019s the guy I want to be.\u2019\u201d",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \u201cHollywood Squares.\u201d Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\u201cBoth Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and \u2018Wheel\u2019 did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 achieved in its heyday,\u201d Griffin said in \u201cMerv: Making the Good Life Last,\u201d an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which tourbed in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \u201cNaturally Stoned,\u201d with Woolery singing, \u201cWhen I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I\u2019m naturally stoned.\u201d",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \u201cI\u2019ve Been Wrong\u201d in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \u201cForgive My Heart\u201d and \u201cLove Me, Love Me.\u201d",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette\u2019s 1971 album \u201cWe Sure Can Love Each Other,\u201d Woolery wrote \u201cThe Joys of Being a Woman\u201d with lyrics including \u201cSee our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\u201d",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn\u2019t revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \u201cBlunt Force Truth\u201d and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don\u2019t need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\u201d he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \u201cImpeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\u201d",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump\u2019s chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it\u2019s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \u201cTo further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\u201d Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \u201ca hoax\u201d or said \u201cit\u2019s not real,\u201d just that \u201cwe\u2019ve been lied to.\u201d Woolery also said it was \u201can honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it\u2019s important enough to do that.\u201d",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has set dates for a special election to replace Matt Gaetz. The timeline will leave his seat vacant in the incoming Congress for several weeks.",
    "story": [
      "In bad news for House Republicans, his seat will be left vacant for months.",
      "Following news Friday that former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz does not intend to return to Congress after he withdrew from consideration to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, it appears his seat will be vacant for months -- presenting a challenge for House Republicans who already maintain a slim majority in the incoming Congress.",
      "On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis set the FL-01 special election primary for Jan. 28 and the general election for April 1. That means Gaetz's seat will be unfilled for at least 12 weeks in the 119th Congress.",
      "\"At Gov. Ron DeSantis' direction, this special election is being conducted as quickly as statutorily possible,\" said Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd on Friday. \"We are committed to ensuring this election is held as soon as we are allowed to hold it by state law.\"",
      "Such a vacancy would cut into the narrow majority House Republicans are projected to have in the next Congress, which will only continue to shrink if GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and Michael Waltz are confirmed to be in Trump's Cabinet.",
      "ABC News projects that Republicans have won 219 seats and Democrats 213 in the House. The numbers do not take into account any departures for jobs in the Trump administration or Gaetz's resignation. There are also three outstanding House races that still haven't been called, which will determine the ultimate size of the GOP's majority.",
      "The special election schedule is at the Florida governor's discretion. For instance, the dates set by DeSantis in 2022 to fill the vacancy of the late Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings left the seat open for nine months, despite Democrats' pushing for a speedier process.",
      "At least half a dozen Florida Republicans have already expressed willingness to run for Gaetz's seat. 538 rates Florida's 1st Congressional District, which Gaetz represented for eight years, as \"solid Republican.\"",
      "Gaetz on Friday sat for his first interview with conservative commentator Charlie Kirk since withdrawing as Trump's attorney general pick. During the interview, the conservative firebrand announced then that he would not return to Congress, despite having won reelection in November by 32 points.",
      "\"I'm going to be fighting for President Trump. I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have,\" Gaetz said. \"But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:14:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has big plans for the economy \u2014 and a big debt problem that will be a hurdle to delivering on them.",
      "Trump has bold ideas on tax cuts, tariffs and other programs, but high interest rates and the price of repaying the federal government\u2019s existing debt could limit what he\u2019s able to do.",
      "Not only is the federal debt at roughly $36 trillion, but the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up the government's borrowing costs such that debt service next year will easily exceed spending on national security.",
      "The higher cost of servicing the debt gives Trump less room to maneuver with the federal budget as he seeks income tax cuts. It's also a political challenge because higher interest rates have made it costlier for many Americans to buy a home or new automobile. And the issue of high costs helped Trump reclaim the presidency in November's election.",
      "\u201cIt's clear the current amount of debt is putting upward pressure on interest rates, including mortgage rates for instance,\" said Shai Akabas, executive director of the economic policy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThe cost of housing and groceries is going to be increasingly felt by households in a way that are going to adversely affect our economic prospects in the future.\u201d",
      "Akabas stressed that the debt service is already starting to crowd out government spending on basic needs such as infrastructure and education. About 1 in 5 dollars spent by the government are now repaying investors for borrowed money, instead of enabling investments in future economic growth.",
      "It's an issue on Trump's radar. In his statement on choosing billionaire investor Scott Bessent to be his treasury secretary, the Republican president-elect said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt.\u201d",
      "The debt service costs along with the higher total debt complicate Trump's efforts to renew his 2017 tax cuts, much of which are set to expire after next year. The higher debt from those tax cuts could push interest rates higher, making debt service even costlier and minimizing any benefits the tax cuts could produce for growth.",
      "\u201cClearly, it's irresponsible to run back the same tax cuts after the deficit has tripled,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a former Republican congressional aide. \u201cEven congressional Republicans behind the scenes are looking for ways to scale down the president\u2019s ambitions.\u201d",
      "Democrats and many economists say Trump's income tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which deprives the government of revenues needed for programs for the middle class and poor.",
      "\"The president-elect\u2019s tax policy ideas will increase the deficit because they will decrease taxes for those with the highest ability to pay, such as the corporations whose tax rate he\u2019s proposed reducing even further to 15%,\u201d said Jessica Fulton, vice president of policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that deals with issues facing communities of color.",
      "Trump's team insists he can make the math work.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including lowering prices. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump transition spokeswoman.",
      "When Trump was last in the White House in 2020, the federal government was spending $345 billion annually to service the national debt. It was possible to run up the national debt with tax cuts and pandemic aid because the average interest rate was low, such that repayment costs were manageable even as debt levels climbed.",
      "Congressional Budget Office projections indicate that debt service costs next year could exceed $1 trillion. That's more than projected spending on defense. The total is also greater than nondefense spending on infrastructure, food aid and other programs under the direction of Congress.",
      "What fueled the increased cost of servicing the debt has been higher interest rates. In April 2020, when the government was borrowing trillions of dollars to address the pandemic, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell as low as 0.6%. They're now 4.4%, having increasing since September as investors expect Trump to add several trillions of dollars onto projected deficits with his income tax cuts.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden can point to strong economic growth and successfully avoiding a recession as the Federal Reserve sought to bring down inflation. Still, deficits ran at unusually high levels during his term. That's due in part to his own initiatives to boost manufacturing and address climate change, and to the legacy of Trump's previous tax cuts.",
      "People in Trump's orbit, as well as Republican lawmakers, are already scouting out ways to reduce government spending in order to minimize the debt and bring down interest rates. They have attacked Biden for the deficits and inflation, setting the stage for whether they can persuade Trump to take action.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy businessmen leading Trump's efforts to cut government costs, have proposed that the incoming administration should simply refuse to spend some of the money approved by Congress. It's an idea that Trump has also backed, but one that would likely provoke challenges in court as it would undermine congressional authority.",
      "Russell Vought, the White House budget director during Trump's first term and Trump's choice to lead it again, put out an alternative proposed budget for 2023 with more than $11 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in order to potentially generate a surplus.",
      "Michael Faulkender, a finance professor who served in Trump's Treasury Department, told a congressional committee in March that all the energy and environmental components of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 should be repealed to reduce deficits.",
      "Trump has also talked up tariffs on imports to generate revenues and reduce deficits, while some Republican lawmakers such as House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, have discussed adding work requirements to trim Medicaid expenses.",
      "The White House was last pressured by high rates to address debt service costs roughly three decades ago during the start of Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency. Higher yields on the 10-year Treasury notes led Clinton and Congress to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, ultimately producing a budget surplus starting in 1998.",
      "Clinton political adviser James Carville joked at the time about how bond investors pushing up borrowing rates for the U.S. government could humble the commander in chief.",
      "\u201cI used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter,\" Carville said. \"But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\u201d",

      "The former mayor and businesswoman lost her bid for reelection to the House.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick for labor secretary is one of the few Republican lawmakers to sign on to the Protecting the Right to Organize Act -- otherwise known as the PRO Act -- legislation that would make it easier for workers to unionize, and her nomination is being applauded by some key labor unions.",
      "Trump announced Friday his plans to nominate Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to head the Labor Department, a post that requires Senate confirmation.",
      "\"Lori's strong support from both the Business and Labor communities will ensure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success - Making America Richer, Wealthier, Stronger and more Prosperous than ever before!\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer is the first Republican woman and one of the first two Latinas to serve in Congress from the state of Oregon. The former Happy Valley mayor and businesswoman lost her bid to regain Oregon's 5th District earlier this month.",
      "The freshman congresswoman serves on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which started as the committee on education and labor over 150 years ago. If calls to dismantle the federal Department of Education are successful during the second Trump administration, Chavez-DeRemer could potentially oversee education programs that are redistributed to the labor department.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) has introduced legislation with a multi-year roadmap to eliminate the Department of Education and earmarked the department's responsibilities for the Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, State, and Labor according to the bill text.",
      "Chairwoman Virginia Foxx released the following statement congratulating her colleague on the congressional committee.",
      "\"I look forward to seeing a Department of Labor that embraces free enterprise policies so workers and job creators can flourish. It's time the heavy hand of the federal government got out of the way. Instead of punitive, overzealous, job-killing regulations it's time to unleash America's ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit.\"",
      "The selection of Chavez-DeRemer is also being applauded by some key labor unions.",
      "The National Education Association (NEA), the nation's largest professional employee organization, applauded the nomination.",
      "\"During her time in Congress, Lori Chavez-DeRemer voted against gutting the Department of Education, against school vouchers, and against cuts to education funding. She cosponsored the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, the PRO Act, and other pro-student, pro-public school, pro-worker legislation,\" NEA President Becky Pringle said in a statement.",
      "The PRO Act would expand labor protections regarding workers' rights to form unions in the workplace. Chavez-DeRemer, who signed on to co-sponsor the bill this summer, is one of just three Republicans in the House to do so.",
      "\"This record stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump's anti-worker, anti-union record, and his extreme Project 2025 agenda that would gut workplace protections, make it harder for workers to unionize, and diminish the voice of working people,\" Pringle added.",
      "She added, \"Educators and working families across the nation will be watching Lori Chavez-DeRemer as she moves through the confirmation process and hope to hear a pledge from her to continue to stand up for workers and students as her record suggests, not blind loyalty to the Project 2025 agenda.\"",
      "Sean O'Brien, president of the Teamsters union, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, had reportedly been pushing for Trump to nominate Chavez-DeRemer to the post.",
      "After the nomination was announced, O'Brien posted a congratulatory message on the social media platform, X."

      "He was a populist who championed Democratic Party reforms in the turbulent '60s.",
      "Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator from Oklahoma, presidential hopeful and populist who championed Democratic Party reforms in the turbulent 1960s, died Saturday. He was 94.",
      "Harris\u2019 wife, Margaret Elliston, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. It was not immediately clear where he died, but he had lived in New Mexico since 1976 and was a resident of Corrales at the time of his death.",
      "\u201cFred Harris passed peacefully early this morning of natural causes. He was 94. He was a wonderful and beloved man. His memory is a blessing,\u201d Elliston said in a text message.",
      "Harris served eight years in the Senate, first winning in 1964 to fill a vacancy, and made unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1976.",
      "It fell to Harris, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1969 and 1970, to help heal the party\u2019s wounds from the tumultuous national convention in 1968 when protesters and police clashed in Chicago.",
      "He ushered in rule changes that led to more women and minorities as convention delegates and in leadership positions.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s worked wonderfully,\u201d Harris recalled in 2004, when he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s made the selection much more legitimate and democratic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was not democratic, and many of the delegations were pretty much boss-controlled or -dominated. And in the South, there was terrible discrimination against African Americans,\u201d he said.",
      "Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, quitting after poor showings in early contests, including a fourth-place win in New Hampshire. The more moderate Jimmy Carter went on to win the presidency.",
      "Harris moved to New Mexico that year and became a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. He wrote and edited more than a dozen books, mostly on politics and Congress. In 1999 he broadened his writings with a mystery set in Depression-era Oklahoma.",
      "Throughout his political career, Harris was a leading liberal voice for civil rights and anti-poverty programs to help minorities and the disadvantaged.",
      "\u201cDemocrats everywhere will remember Fred for his unparalleled integrity and as a pioneer for instituting core progressive values of equity and opportunity for prosperity as core tenets of our party,\u201d the Democratic Party of New Mexico said in a statement.",
      "Along with his first wife, LaDonna, a Comanche, he also was active in Native American issues.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always called myself a populist or progressive,\u201d Harris said in a 1998 interview. \u201cI\u2019m against concentrated power. I don\u2019t like the power of money in politics. I think we ought to have programs for the middle class and working class.\u201d",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham praised his work for their shared state and the nation.",
      "\u201cIn addition to being a highly accomplished politician and professor, he was a decent, honorable man who treated everyone with warmth, generosity, and good humor,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSen. Harris was a lesson in leadership that public officials would be wise to emulate now and forever.\u201d",
      "Harris was a member of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the so-called Kerner Commission, appointed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to investigate the urban riots of the late 1960s.",
      "The commission\u2019s groundbreaking report in 1968 declared, \u201cour nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\u201d",
      "Thirty years later, Harris co-wrote a report that concluded the commission\u2019s \u201cprophecy has come to pass.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and minorities are suffering disproportionately,\u201d said the report by Harris and Lynn A. Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation, which continued the work of the commission.",
      "Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said Harris rose to prominence in Congress as a \u201cfiery populist.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat resonates with people ... the notion of the average person against the elite,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cFred Harris had a real ability to articulate those concerns, particularly of the downtrodden.\u201d",
      "In 1968, Harris served as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. He and others pressed Humphrey to use the convention to break with Johnson on the Vietnam War. But Humphrey waited to do so until late in the campaign, and narrowly lost to Republican Richard Nixon.",
      "\u201cThat was the worst year of my life, \u201968. We had Dr. Martin Luther King killed. We had my Senate seatmate Robert Kennedy killed and then we had this terrible convention,\u201d Harris said in 1996.",
      "\u201cI left the convention \u2014 because of the terrible disorders and the way they had been handled and the failure to adopt a new peace platform \u2014 really downhearted.\u201d",
      "After assuming the Democratic Party leadership post, Harris appointed commissions that recommended reforms in the procedures for selecting delegates and presidential nominees. While lauding the greater openness and diversity, he said there had been a side effect: \u201cIt\u2019s much to the good. But the one result of it is that conventions today are ratifying conventions. So it\u2019s hard to make them interesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy own thought is they ought to be shortened to a couple of days. But they are still worth having, I think, as a way to adopt a platform, as a kind of pep rally, as a way to get people together in a kind of coalition-building,\u201d he said.",
      "Harris was born Nov. 13, 1930, in a two-room farmhouse near Walters, in southwestern Oklahoma, about 15 miles from the Texas line. The home had no electricity, indoor toilet or running water.",
      "At age 5 he was working on the farm and received 10 cents a day to drive a horse in circles to supply power for a hay bailer.",
      "He worked part-time as a janitor and printer\u2019s assistant to help for his education at University of Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1952, majoring in political science and history. He received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1954, and then moved to Lawton to practice.",
      "In 1956, he won election to the Oklahoma state Senate and served for eight years. In 1964, he launched his career in national politics in the race to replace Sen. Robert S. Kerr, who died in January 1963.",
      "Harris won the Democratic nomination in a runoff election against J. Howard Edmondson, who left the governorship to fill Kerr\u2019s vacancy until the next election. In the general election, Harris defeated an Oklahoma sports legend \u2014 Charles \u201cBud\u201d Wilkinson, who had coached OU football for 17 years.",
      "Harris won a six-year term in 1966 but left the Senate in 1972 when there were doubts that he, as a left-leaning Democrat, could win reelection.",
      "Harris married his high school sweetheart, LaDonna Vita Crawford, in 1949, and had three children, Kathryn, Byron and Laura. After the couple divorced, Harris married Margaret Elliston in 1983. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available Saturday.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene has been tapped to chair a new congressional subcommittee aimed at eliminating government waste under the newly formed \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" which is set to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy -- and firing government employees could be part of her plan.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announced the creation of the new GOP-controlled \"Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE)\" subcommittee in the next Congress, and Greene, a loyal supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, will chair it.",
      "Greene said in the new position, she will work to \"identify and investigate the waste, corruption, and absolutely useless parts of our federal government.\"",
      "\"Our subcommittee will provide transparency and truth to the American people through hearings,\" she said in a statement. \"The goal of DOGE is to bring accountability and GUT useless government agencies.\"",

      "\"So now a noted student of American government, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, will chair a subcommittee to work with two unvetted billionaires who stand to receive billions more in government contracts and subsidies from the government under Trump,\" Raskin said in a statement.",
      "The Georgia Republican has pledged to carry out Trump's agenda in the role and \"rooted out every penny of waste and abuse\" -- signaling that government employees' jobs could be on the chopping block.",

But for some reason, in government, bad employees\u2014whether they're failing to do the job they were hired to do or working in roles that are no longer needed\u2014never get fired,\" Greene wrote in a post on X on Thursday. \"This is incredibly unfair to the hard-working taxpayers of our country, and it's about to change.\"",
      "Trump himself has made no secret of his plans to cut what he sees as government waste by calling for the dismantling for the Department of Education and selecting Cabinet picks who talk about abolishing entire agencies and firing tens of thousands of federal workers at a time.",
      "Helping in that effort could be the new Department of Government Efficiency -- helmed by Musk and Ramaswamy, both staunch allies of the president-elect. While DOGE will not be a federal agency in the U.S. government, Trump said it will provide advice and guidance \"outside of government\" and partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to \"drive structural government reform.\"",

    "story": [
      "The president-elect has made millions licensing his name and image for profit.",
      "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump hawked apparel and keepsakes promoting his presidential bid in what experts ABC spoke with characterized as an unprecedented effort to commoditize his political platform.",
      "Now, after his triumph at the polls, the president-elect is again seeking to cash in on his personal brand with a fresh line of goods, from a pair of $299 \"Trump Landslide\" boots to a $69.99 special inaugural edition of his God Bless the USA Bible.",
      "As the former president prepares to return to the Oval Office, experts warned that the opaque structure of the companies that produce these items could create fresh conflicts of interest for Trump -- with few public details about who Trump is in business with and how much he profits.",
      "\"We've never seen a president merchandise like this,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group. \"Tracking partners is very difficult unless they come forward, and there's no way to know for sure.\"",
      "Compared to his $3 billion stake in his social media company and his multimillion-dollar buildings, Trump's licensing deals comprise only a fraction of his portfolio -- but his opaque deals can be ethical \"black boxes\" that escape outside scrutiny according to Libowitz.",
      "Without knowing who the president-elect is in business with, it's impossible to know if he might use the power of his office to help his bottom line or benefit his business partners or whoever is contributing money to him, Libowitz said.",
      "Trump has entered into the licensing agreements through two companies -- CIC Ventures LLC and CIC Digital LLC -- that are fully owned by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. According to a 2023 financial disclosure, Trump made more than $7 million though CIC Digital LLC, which entered a licensee agreement for the sale of nonfungible tokens or NFTs.",
      "Trump used CIC Ventures LLC to make more than $5 million through bible and book sales, and information is not yet public about how much Trump has made from other deals like his watches and shoes.",
      "Those companies quickly launched new items following Trump's electoral victory. Trump Sneakers unveiled a full line of \"Trump Won\" footwear, including a gold pair of low-top sneakers for $499. Trump Coins unveiled a one-ounce \"Victory Gold Medallion\" -- with the president-elect's face and signature pressed in solid gold -- for $3,645.47, a thousand-dollar upcharge compared to the price of an ounce of gold. And Trump Watches unveiled a \"Victory Collection\" priced between $599 and $1,299.",
      "\"Donald Trump proved his greatest skill was as a salesman, selling mostly junk products, and he hasn't stopped,\" said Robert Weissman, co-president of the progressive watchdog group Public Citizen.",

      "The instruments -- which include the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" in pearl inlay -- start at $1,250. A limited version of the guitars signed by Trump is on sale for $11,250. Details about where the guitars are made and how much profit, if any, Trump makes from the sales, were not immediately available, and Trump Guitars did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Items like Trump sneakers and watches are distinct from the merchandise Trump sells through his campaign website, which offers everything from Make America Great Again hats to Christmas ornaments. The profit from those purchases goes toward Trump's joint fundraising committee, which is subject to rigorous reporting requirements for political contributions.",
      "But the external companies that Trump licenses to sell his other items aren't subject to oversight. It's an approach that Trump has taken for decades: Making money from his brand by selling everything from steaks to vodka with limited involvement, by outsourcing the design, production, and distribution of the goods under license to separate companies, about which little is often known.",
      "For someone in power, like the president, that arrangement can create \"areas of potential concern,\" according to Weissman.",
      "Details about the terms of Trump's agreements with the merchandise companies -- such as JBCZ Group LLC for his coins or TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC for his watches -- are not public, and the LLCs are registered in states that offer few details about the companies' ownership.",
      "Some of Trump's merchandise -- such as his NFTs or watches -- also sell for wildly high prices that create an avenue for individuals, including potentially foreign actors, to channel money to Trump, according to Libowitz. Trump Watches is currently offering a \"Trump Victory Tourbillon\" watch for $100,000.",
      "\"That kind of seems like it is a way to put money directly in his pockets,\" said Libowitz, who believes the watch is likely worth a fraction of its asking price. \"It's an opportunity to give money directly to him and let him know that.\"",
      "Trump Watches, Trump Coins, Trump Sneakers, and God Bless The USA Bible did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, and nor did a spokesperson for Trump's transition team.",
      "When Trump entered the White House in 2017, he resigned as the trustee of Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and passed control to his sons and a business partner to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The setup allowed Trump to still profit from his businesses while relinquishing control of day-to-day operations and decisions.",
      "While he regained control of the Trust when he left office in 2021, it's expected that he'll again hand over control when he returns to office in January -- although experts say the arrangement is unlikely to shed additional light on his licensing deals.",
      "\"He's not constrained by any norms or regulations,\" said Weissman. \"He'll disclose what he wants to disclose.\"",

      "Since being tapped as President-elect Donald Trump's controversial pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been criticized by medical and public health experts for his anti-vaccine history, his current vaccine skepticism, his take on the COVID-19 pandemic -- and by some for his descriptions of fluorinated water. But some of the environmental attorney's views are also receiving support from some unexpected sources.",
      "On Wednesday, renowned food author Michael Pollan echoed those criticisms -- but offered some praise for Kennedy's criticism of the American food industry, which Kennedy has accused of propagating obesity and chronic disease.",
      "\"He's voicing a critique of the food system that is important,\" Pollan told ABC News, while making clear he was drawing a \"strong distinction\" between Kennedy's food stances and his medical advice -- and that he thinks Kennedy is a \"horrible\" choice for the job.",
      "Pollan's comments join a stance taken in recent days by some prominent Democrats who have praised Kennedy for his vows to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" in part by tackling the food industry -- while condemning him for his years working against vaccine health policies.",
      "The comments from Pollan to ABC News came after he shared a seemingly positive article on social media about Kennedy titled, \"They're lying about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" -- a move that prompted Kennedy himself to reply and suggest they work together.",
      "\"Thanks @michaelpollan!\" Kennedy wrote Thursday on X. \"I'd love to work with you to restore our public health agencies to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Asked if he would take Kennedy up on the offer, Pollan was clear: \"No.\"",
      "\"I've got my role to play, and that's not the role,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Kennedy has faced fierce criticism over his claims that vaccines are behind an \"epidemic\" of diseases in America, and that cavity-fighting mineral fluoride, added in small amounts to some drinking water, is \"industrial waste.\" Pollan said Kennedy's stances on vaccines and fluoride \"seem nutty\" and that he was overall a \"horrible\" pick to lead HHS.",

      "Earlier this week, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey posted a video on social media about how he has been \"raising the alarm of the dangers of our current food system.\"",
      "\"Food in America is making us sick,\" Booker said in the video. Though he did not mention Kennedy by name, Kennedy reposted the video, thanking Booker for his \"long history of leadership on this issue.\"",
      "Asked by ABC News, Booker said he had not yet made up his mind on Kennedy's nomination, saying that Kennedy would need to go through the confirmation process and that Kennedy's stances on vaccines were \"very troubling.\" He added he was \"super skeptical of the Trump administration's efforts in any way to say that they are going to be doing things to make us more healthy.\"",
      "Still, Booker added he was \"happy to hear\" Kennedy on some of the issues around health, saying, \"There's a growing coalition in America from both sides of the aisle really demanding change. I hope, if the Trump administration is willing to do something right and positive on these issues, I'll be right there.\"",
      "\"When it comes to RFK, we're going to look at the totality of his record, we're going to evaluate and make a decision, but my focus is trying to block Trump from doing more damage to Americans health, like he did last time,\" Booker said.",
      "Pollan, for his part, questioned just how much Trump would let Kennedy make true reforms to the food industry, should Kennedy be confirmed.",
      "\"I have my doubts about whether Trump is going to give him authority to do what he wants to do around food,\" Pollan said of Kennedy, who over the weekend was in a viral photo eating McDonald's with Trump and others on Trump's plane. \"Whether he'll get anywhere, I have my doubts -- but I am pleased to see these issues getting talked about.\"",

      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",
      "Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. \u201cArriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,\u201d she says.",

    "summary": "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook &ldquo;Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,&rdquo; has died",
    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "title": "Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy as financial losses pile up and debt payments loom",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "The fires broke out Sept. 29 at the BioLab plant in Conyers, sending a huge plume of orange and black smoke into the sky. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board on Friday released an investigation update.",
      "BioLab makes chemicals that kill algae and bacteria in water, primarily for swimming pools and hot tubs, the report says. The company is a subsidiary of Lawrenceville, Georgia-based KIK Consumer Products.",
      "A BioLab employee on fire watch at the Plant 12 storage warehouse reported hearing a \u201cpopping sound\u201d as they left a breakroom to do a 5 a.m. check and immediately saw that a product reactive to water was wet, the report says. The employee called the only other BioLab employee on site.",
      "Though no flames were initially observed, the employee on fire watch tried unsuccessfully to isolate the product and called 911 at about 5:10 a.m. as \"large toxic vapor plumes\" formed inside the building.",
      "By 6:30 a.m., flames could be seen through the roof of the area where employees first noticed the chemical reaction. An initial shelter-in-place order was issued around 7:40 a.m., and the fire was put out by Rockdale County firefighters about 30 minutes later.",
      "A second fire broke out around noon, producing \u201cthick black smoke, followed by multicolor plumes,\u201d the report says. Evacuations of the surrounding area began around 12:30 p.m., and the county fire chief said the fire was extinguished by 4 p.m.",
      "Parts of the building where the initial reaction happened collapsed during the fire, and the building was completely destroyed. The Plant 12 building covered an area larger than five football fields and remained an \u201cactive emergency response scene\u201d for nearly four weeks, the report says.",
      "The Plant 12 warehouse was a bulk storage area separated from the main warehouse by a firewall and fire shutters, the report says.

      "Interstate 20, which runs parallel to the facility, was shut down shortly after the building collapsed just before 1 p.m. and was closed until about 7 a.m. the next day. Smaller roads near the facility remained closed and the Rockdale County Emergency Management Agency issued shelter-in-place warnings within a two-mile radius that lasted for several weeks. The final order expired Oct. 17.",
      "Smoke drifted toward Atlanta, causing a smog or haze that smelled of chlorine in parts of the city and surrounding area.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:58:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are pushing back against criticism from some Democrats that President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s pick to lead U.S. intelligence services is &ldquo;compromised&rdquo; by her comments supportive of Russia and a meeting with an ally of that country",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers are pushing back against criticism from some Democrats that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead U.S. intelligence services is \u201ccompromised\u201d by her comments supportive of Russia and a meeting with an ally of that country",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Republican senators pushed back on Sunday against criticism from Democrats that Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump's pick to lead U.S. intelligence services, is \u201ccompromised\u201d by her comments supportive of Russia and secret meetings, as a congresswoman, with Syria\u2019s president, a close ally of the Kremlin and Iran.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois, a veteran of combat missions in Iraq, said she had concerns about Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's choice to be director of national intelligence.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s compromised,\" Duckworth said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\" citing Gabbard's 2017 trip to Syria, where she held talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad. Gabbard was a Democratic House member from Hawaii at the time.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. intelligence community has identified her as having troubling relationships with America\u2019s foes. And so my worry is that she couldn\u2019t pass a background check,\u201d Duckworth said.",
      "Gabbard, who said last month she is joining the Republican party, has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades. She was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait and, according to the Hawaii National Guard, received a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for \u201cparticipation in combat operations under enemy hostile fire in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III.\"",
      "Duckworth's comments drew immediate backlash from Republicans.",
      "\u201cFor her to say ridiculous and outright dangerous words like that is wrong,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma, said on CNN, challenging Duckworth to retract her words. \u201cThat\u2019s the most dangerous thing she could say \u2014 is that a United States lieutenant colonel in the United States Army is compromised and is an asset of Russia.\u201d",
      "In recent days, other Democrats have accused Gabbard without evidence of being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has claimed, without offering details, that Gabbard is in Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin\u2019s pocket.\u201d",
      "Mullin and others say the criticism from Democrats is rooted in the fact that Gabbard left their party and has become a Trump ally. Democrats say they worry that Gabbard's selection as national intelligence chief endangers ties with allies and gives Russia a win.",
      "Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat just elected to the Senate, said he would not describe Gabbard as a Russian asset, but said she had \u201cvery questionable judgment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is if our foreign allies don\u2019t trust the head of our intelligence agencies, they\u2019ll stop sharing information with us,\u201d Schiff said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Gabbard in 2022 endorsed one of Russia\u2019s justifications for invading Ukraine: the existence of dozens of U.S.-funded biolabs working on some of the world\u2019s nastiest pathogens. The labs are part of an international effort to control outbreaks and stop bioweapons, but Moscow claimed Ukraine was using them to create deadly bioweapons. Gabbard said she just voiced concerns about protecting the labs.",
      "Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Missouri, said he thought it was \u201ctotally ridiculous\u201d that Gabbard was being cast as a Russian asset for having different political views.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s a slur, quite frankly. There\u2019s no evidence that she\u2019s a asset of another country,\u201d he said on NBC.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, another Oklahoma Republican, acknowledged having \u201clots of questions\u201d for Gabbard as the Senate considers her nomination to lead the intelligence services. Lankford said on NBC that he wants to ask Gabbard about her meeting with Assad and some of her past comments about Russia.",
      "\u201cWe want to know what the purpose was and what the direction for that was. As a member of Congress, we want to get a chance to talk about past comments that she\u2019s made and get them into full context,\u201d Lankford said."

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:14:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has big plans for the economy \u2014 and a big debt problem that will be a hurdle to delivering on them.",
      "Trump has bold ideas on tax cuts, tariffs and other programs, but high interest rates and the price of repaying the federal government\u2019s existing debt could limit what he\u2019s able to do.",
      "Not only is the federal debt at roughly $36 trillion, but the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up the government's borrowing costs such that debt service next year will easily exceed spending on national security.",
      "The higher cost of servicing the debt gives Trump less room to maneuver with the federal budget as he seeks income tax cuts. It's also a political challenge because higher interest rates have made it costlier for many Americans to buy a home or new automobile. And the issue of high costs helped Trump reclaim the presidency in November's election.",
      "\u201cIt's clear the current amount of debt is putting upward pressure on interest rates, including mortgage rates for instance,\" said Shai Akabas, executive director of the economic policy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThe cost of housing and groceries is going to be increasingly felt by households in a way that are going to adversely affect our economic prospects in the future.\u201d",
      "Akabas stressed that the debt service is already starting to crowd out government spending on basic needs such as infrastructure and education. About 1 in 5 dollars spent by the government are now repaying investors for borrowed money, instead of enabling investments in future economic growth.",
      "It's an issue on Trump's radar. In his statement on choosing billionaire investor Scott Bessent to be his treasury secretary, the Republican president-elect said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt.\u201d",
      "The debt service costs along with the higher total debt complicate Trump's efforts to renew his 2017 tax cuts, much of which are set to expire after next year. The higher debt from those tax cuts could push interest rates higher, making debt service even costlier and minimizing any benefits the tax cuts could produce for growth.",
      "\u201cClearly, it's irresponsible to run back the same tax cuts after the deficit has tripled,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a former Republican congressional aide. \u201cEven congressional Republicans behind the scenes are looking for ways to scale down the president\u2019s ambitions.\u201d",
      "Democrats and many economists say Trump's income tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which deprives the government of revenues needed for programs for the middle class and poor.",
      "\"The president-elect\u2019s tax policy ideas will increase the deficit because they will decrease taxes for those with the highest ability to pay, such as the corporations whose tax rate he\u2019s proposed reducing even further to 15%,\u201d said Jessica Fulton, vice president of policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that deals with issues facing communities of color.",
      "Trump's team insists he can make the math work.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including lowering prices. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump transition spokeswoman.",
      "When Trump was last in the White House in 2020, the federal government was spending $345 billion annually to service the national debt. It was possible to run up the national debt with tax cuts and pandemic aid because the average interest rate was low, such that repayment costs were manageable even as debt levels climbed.",
      "Congressional Budget Office projections indicate that debt service costs next year could exceed $1 trillion. That's more than projected spending on defense. The total is also greater than nondefense spending on infrastructure, food aid and other programs under the direction of Congress.",
      "What fueled the increased cost of servicing the debt has been higher interest rates. In April 2020, when the government was borrowing trillions of dollars to address the pandemic, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell as low as 0.6%. They're now 4.4%, having increasing since September as investors expect Trump to add several trillions of dollars onto projected deficits with his income tax cuts.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden can point to strong economic growth and successfully avoiding a recession as the Federal Reserve sought to bring down inflation. Still, deficits ran at unusually high levels during his term. That's due in part to his own initiatives to boost manufacturing and address climate change, and to the legacy of Trump's previous tax cuts.",
      "People in Trump's orbit, as well as Republican lawmakers, are already scouting out ways to reduce government spending in order to minimize the debt and bring down interest rates. They have attacked Biden for the deficits and inflation, setting the stage for whether they can persuade Trump to take action.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy businessmen leading Trump's efforts to cut government costs, have proposed that the incoming administration should simply refuse to spend some of the money approved by Congress. It's an idea that Trump has also backed, but one that would likely provoke challenges in court as it would undermine congressional authority.",
      "Russell Vought, the White House budget director during Trump's first term and Trump's choice to lead it again, put out an alternative proposed budget for 2023 with more than $11 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in order to potentially generate a surplus.",
      "Michael Faulkender, a finance professor who served in Trump's Treasury Department, told a congressional committee in March that all the energy and environmental components of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 should be repealed to reduce deficits.",
      "Trump has also talked up tariffs on imports to generate revenues and reduce deficits, while some Republican lawmakers such as House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, have discussed adding work requirements to trim Medicaid expenses.",
      "The White House was last pressured by high rates to address debt service costs roughly three decades ago during the start of Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency. Higher yields on the 10-year Treasury notes led Clinton and Congress to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, ultimately producing a budget surplus starting in 1998.",
      "Clinton political adviser James Carville joked at the time about how bond investors pushing up borrowing rates for the U.S. government could humble the commander in chief.",
      "\u201cI used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter,\" Carville said. \"But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\u201d"

      "WINDSOR, Calif. -- Forecasters through the U.S. issued warnings that another round of winter weather could complicate travel leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, while California and Washington state continue to recover from storm damage and power outages.",
      "In California, where a person was found dead in a vehicle submerged in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more precipitation while grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm.",
      "The National Weather Service office in Sacramento, California, issued a winter storm warning for the state's Sierra Nevada for Saturday through Tuesday, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 55 mph (88 kph). Total snowfall of roughly 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations expected Monday and Tuesday.",
      "The Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, forecasters said.",
      "A low pressure system is forecast to bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast. Areas from Boston to New York could see rain and breezy conditions, with snowfall possible in parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. If the system tracks further inland, there could be less snow and more rain in the mountains, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t look like a powerhouse right now,\u201d Hayden Frank, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Massachusetts, said Sunday. \u201cBasically, this is going to bring rain to the I-95 corridor so travelers should prepare for wet weather. Unless the system trends a lot colder, it looks like rain.\u201d",
      "Frank said he isn't seeing any major storm systems arriving for the weekend anywhere in the country so travelers heading home Sunday can expect good driving conditions. Temperatures, however, will get colder in the East while warming up out West.",
      "Earlier this week, two people died when the storm arrived in the Pacific Northwest. Hundreds of thousands lost power, mostly in the Seattle area, before strong winds moved through Northern California. A rapidly intensifying \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d that hit the West Coast on Tuesday brought fierce winds that resulted in home and vehicle damage.",
      "Rescue crews in Guerneville, California, recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Rob Dillion said, noting the deceased was presumed to be a victim of the storm but an autopsy had not yet been conducted.",
      "Santa Rosa, California, saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 12.5 inches (32 centimeters) of rain by Friday evening, the National Weather Service in the Bay Area reported. Vineyards in nearby Windsor, California, were flooded on Saturday.",
      "About 36,000 people in the Seattle area were still without electricity after this season\u2019s strongest atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land.",
      "Another storm brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where rare wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. The precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a drought buster, but it\u2019s definitely going to help when all this melts,\u201d said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York.",
      "Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 17 inches (43 centimeters), with lesser accumulations in valley cities including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Around 35,000 customers in 10 counties are still without power, down from 80,000 a day ago.",
      "In the Catskills region of New York, nearly 10,000 people remained without power on Sunday morning, two days after a storm dumped heavy snow on parts of the region.",
      "Precipitation in West Virginia helped put a dent in the state\u2019s worst drought in at least two decades and boosted ski resorts preparing to open their slopes in the weeks ahead.",

      "The U.S. Northeast is experiencing an unusually severe and widespread drought during months that are typically the wettest",
      "DENVER -- It hasn't been a typical fall for the northeastern United States.",
      "Fires have burned in parks and forests around New York City. Towns and cities in a stretch from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to south of Philadelphia had their driest three months on record, according to the Applied Climate Information System. Some reservoirs in the region are near historic lows.",
      "Major changes need to happen to avoid critical shortages of water in the future, even if that future isn't immediate. As the climate warms, droughts will continue to intensify and communities should use this one as motivation to put in place long-term solutions, experts say.",
      "\u201cThis is the canary in the coal mine for the future,\u201d said Tim Eustance, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. \u201cPeople should stop watering their lawns yesterday.\u201d",
      "Eustance wants New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to issue a drought emergency to increase people\u2019s sense of urgency.",
      "Here are some ways to stretch water experts said could become necessary in the Northeast.",
      "One important place water is stored is under our feet. Groundwater has dropped significantly over the years in parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and New York.",
      "Groundwater makes up about half of New Jersey's drinking water. Sprawl and concrete can make it tough for rain to replenish the water underground.",
      "\u201cNew Jersey is \u2018mall-landia.\u2019 We have these giant parking lots that could be ways to reclaim water instead of having runoff,\u201d Eustance said.",
      "In some other parts of the country there is increasing use of permeable asphalt, concrete and pavers that allow water to percolate into the ground and back into the aquifer. It would be up to municipalities to require that, he said.",
      "A faster way to replenish the aquifer is by injecting highly treated wastewater into it, something Los Angeles has been doing for years. It is dramatically adding to the city's available water.",
      "Virginia Beach, Virginia, is also pumping highly treated water back into its aquifer, and Anne Arundel County in Maryland is trying to pass legislation that would allow the same.",
      "In some places in the western U.S., getting paid to save water has long been an option. Some cities and counties pay dollars for every square foot of lawn torn out and replaced with native landscaping.",
      "Those policies are not nearly as widespread in the Northeast, said Alan Roberson, CEO of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.",
      "\u201cThe abundance has created a different perspective,\u201d he said. This can make it hard to get people on board with conservation.",
      "Upgraded water meters can give customers details about their water use and help them see where they can save money when drought doesn't feel as urgent, said Beth O'Connell, chief engineer for Anne Arundel County, Maryland.",
      "The concept is simple: capture water from the sink, clothes washer, shower and toilet, treat it to a high standard and use it again for nonpotable purposes: It can be sent back through pipes to flush toilets, cool buildings, water yards or help raise water levels in a river or aquifer.",
      "\u201cOne of the crimes I think, in America, is we use drinking water to water our lawns and flush our toilet,\u201d Eustance said.",
      "Zach Gallagher is CEO of Natural Systems Utilities, which designs, builds and operates water recycling systems. He also is the father of three kids and lives in New Jersey, so this drought hits close to home.",
      "\u201cI feel like I'm doing something that is going to be meaningful and leave something beyond for my children, and their children,\u201d he said.",
      "Reuse can be a tool for both drought and flood, he explained. When a building can reuse its own wastewater and discharge it directly into a body of water, it eases stress on a city's fragile sewer system, which is a common vulnerability in old coastal cities. It also reduces demand on new water.",
      "Once open this summer, the company's redesign of the old Domino Sugar Refinery on New York\u2019s East River will be able to treat 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of wastewater a day, enough to cover a football field in nearly 15 inches (38 centimeters) of water. The cleaned water will be piped back into the new mixed-use buildings for flushing toilets, cooling and landscaping, with some of it discharged back into the river.",
      "Nonpotable reuse has a growing footprint in the eastern U.S., but scaling it to a regional level should be the next focus, O'Connell said.",
      "Planning for a future that includes extended drought can be costly. It could also require a shift in mindset from one of abundance to conservation, said Del Shannon, dam engineer and member of the American Society of Civil Engineers.",
      "He has worked on water projects around the world and said many developing countries are focused on getting reliable water for crops and drinking.",
      "\u201cWe need to treat our water and guard it as gently as those countries are.\"",

    "story": [
      "The last meatpackers in New York's Meatpacking District have agreed to end their leases early and make way for development on their city-owned lot",
      "NEW YORK -- When John Jobbagy\u2019s grandfather immigrated from Budapest in 1900, he joined a throng of European butchers chopping up and shipping off meat in a loud, smelly corner of Manhattan that New Yorkers called the Meatpacking District.",
      "Today only a handful of meatpackers remain, and they're preparing to say goodbye to a very different neighborhood, known more for its high-end boutiques and expensive restaurants than the industry that gave it its name.",
      "Jobbagy and the other tenants in the district\u2019s last meat market have accepted a deal from the city to move out so the building can be redeveloped, the culmination of a decades-long transformation.",
      "\u201cThe neighborhood I grew up in is just all memories,\u201d said Jobbagy, 68. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone for over 20 years.\u201d",
      "In its heyday, it was a gritty hub of over 200 slaughterhouses and packing plants at the intersection of shipping and train lines, where meat and poultry were unloaded, cut and moved quickly to markets. Now the docks are recreation areas and an abandoned freight line is the High Line park. The Whitney Museum of American Art moved from Madison Avenue next to Jobbagy's meat company in 2015.",
      "Some of the new retailers maintain reminders of the neighborhood\u2019s meat-packing past. At the exposed brick entrance to an outlet of fashion brand Rag & Bone, which sells $300 leather belts, is a carefully restored sign from a previous occupant, \u201cDave\u2019s Quality Veal,\u201d in red and white hand-painted lettering.",
      "Another sign for a wholesale meat supplier appears on a long building awning outside Samsung\u2019s U.S. flagship phone store.",
      "But the neighborhood no longer sounds, smells or feels like the place where Jobbagy began working for his father in the late 1960s. He worked through high school and college summers before going into business for himself.",
      "Back then, meatpackers kept bottles of whiskey in their lockers to stay warm inside the refrigerated plants. Outside, \u201cit reeked,\u201d he said, especially on hot days near the poultry houses where chicken juices spilled into the streets.",
      "People only visited the neighborhood if they had business, usually transacting in handshake deals, he said.",
      "Slowly but surely, meatpacking plants began closing or moving out of Manhattan as advances in refrigeration and packaging enabled the meat industry to consolidate around packing plants in the Midwest, many of which can butcher and package more than 5,000 steers in a day and ship directly to supermarkets.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, a new nightlife scene emerged as bars and nightclubs moved in, many catering to the LGBTQ+ community. Sex clubs and slaughterhouses coexisted. And as the decades wore on, the drag queens and club kids began giving way to fashion designers and restaurateurs.",
      "By 2000, \u201cSex and The City\u201d character Samantha had left her Upper East Side apartment for a new home in the Meatpacking District. By the show's final 2003 season, she was outraged to see a Pottery Barn slated to open near a local leather bar.",
      "Another turning point came with the 2009 opening of the High Line, on a defunct rail track originally built in the 1930s. The popular greenway is now flanked by hotels, galleries and luxury apartment buildings.",
      "Jobbagy said his father died five years before the opening and would be baffled at what it looks like now.",
      "\u201cIf I told him that the elevated railroad was going to be turned into a public park, he never would have believed it,\u201d he said.",
      "But the area has changed constantly, noted Andrew Berman, executive director of local architectural preservation group Village Preservation.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t always a meatpacking district. It was a sort of wholesale produce district before that, and it was a shipping district before that,\" Berman said. In the early 1800s, Fort Gansevoort stood there. \"So it\u2019s had many lives and it\u2019s going to continue to have new lives.\u201d",
      "Though an exact eviction date for the last meat market has not been set, some of the other companies will relocate elsewhere.",
      "Not Jobbagy, who has held on by supplying high-end restaurants and the few retail stores that still want fresh hanging meat. He\u2019ll retire, along with his brother and his employees, most of them Latino immigrants who trained with him and saved up to buy second homes in Honduras, Mexico or the Dominican Republic. Some want to move to other industries, in other states.",
      "He expects to be the last meatpacker standing when the cleaver finally falls on Gansevoort Market.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be here when this building closes, when everybody, you know, moves on to something else,\" Jobbagy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I was part of it and I didn\u2019t leave before.\u201d"

      "Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator from Oklahoma, presidential hopeful and populist who championed Democratic Party reforms in the turbulent 1960s, died Saturday. He was 94.",
      "Harris\u2019 wife, Margaret Elliston, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. It was not immediately clear where he died, but he had lived in New Mexico since 1976 and was a resident of Corrales at the time of his death.",
      "\u201cFred Harris passed peacefully early this morning of natural causes. He was 94. He was a wonderful and beloved man. His memory is a blessing,\u201d Elliston said in a text message.",
      "Harris served eight years in the Senate, first winning in 1964 to fill a vacancy, and made unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1976.",
      "It fell to Harris, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1969 and 1970, to help heal the party\u2019s wounds from the tumultuous national convention in 1968 when protesters and police clashed in Chicago.",
      "He ushered in rule changes that led to more women and minorities as convention delegates and in leadership positions.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s worked wonderfully,\u201d Harris recalled in 2004, when he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s made the selection much more legitimate and democratic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was not democratic, and many of the delegations were pretty much boss-controlled or -dominated. And in the South, there was terrible discrimination against African Americans,\u201d he said.",
      "Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, quitting after poor showings in early contests, including a fourth-place win in New Hampshire. The more moderate Jimmy Carter went on to win the presidency.",
      "Harris moved to New Mexico that year and became a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. He wrote and edited more than a dozen books, mostly on politics and Congress. In 1999 he broadened his writings with a mystery set in Depression-era Oklahoma.",
      "Throughout his political career, Harris was a leading liberal voice for civil rights and anti-poverty programs to help minorities and the disadvantaged.",
      "\u201cDemocrats everywhere will remember Fred for his unparalleled integrity and as a pioneer for instituting core progressive values of equity and opportunity for prosperity as core tenets of our party,\u201d the Democratic Party of New Mexico said in a statement.",
      "Along with his first wife, LaDonna, a Comanche, he also was active in Native American issues.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always called myself a populist or progressive,\u201d Harris said in a 1998 interview. \u201cI\u2019m against concentrated power. I don\u2019t like the power of money in politics. I think we ought to have programs for the middle class and working class.\u201d",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham praised his work for their shared state and the nation.",
      "\u201cIn addition to being a highly accomplished politician and professor, he was a decent, honorable man who treated everyone with warmth, generosity, and good humor,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSen. Harris was a lesson in leadership that public officials would be wise to emulate now and forever.\u201d",
      "Harris was a member of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the so-called Kerner Commission, appointed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to investigate the urban riots of the late 1960s.",
      "The commission\u2019s groundbreaking report in 1968 declared, \u201cour nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\u201d",
      "Thirty years later, Harris co-wrote a report that concluded the commission\u2019s \u201cprophecy has come to pass.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and minorities are suffering disproportionately,\u201d said the report by Harris and Lynn A. Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation, which continued the work of the commission.",
      "Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said Harris rose to prominence in Congress as a \u201cfiery populist.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat resonates with people ... the notion of the average person against the elite,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cFred Harris had a real ability to articulate those concerns, particularly of the downtrodden.\u201d",
      "In 1968, Harris served as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. He and others pressed Humphrey to use the convention to break with Johnson on the Vietnam War. But Humphrey waited to do so until late in the campaign, and narrowly lost to Republican Richard Nixon.",
      "\u201cThat was the worst year of my life, \u201968. We had Dr. Martin Luther King killed. We had my Senate seatmate Robert Kennedy killed and then we had this terrible convention,\u201d Harris said in 1996.",
      "\u201cI left the convention \u2014 because of the terrible disorders and the way they had been handled and the failure to adopt a new peace platform \u2014 really downhearted.\u201d",
      "After assuming the Democratic Party leadership post, Harris appointed commissions that recommended reforms in the procedures for selecting delegates and presidential nominees. While lauding the greater openness and diversity, he said there had been a side effect: \u201cIt\u2019s much to the good. But the one result of it is that conventions today are ratifying conventions. So it\u2019s hard to make them interesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy own thought is they ought to be shortened to a couple of days. But they are still worth having, I think, as a way to adopt a platform, as a kind of pep rally, as a way to get people together in a kind of coalition-building,\u201d he said.",
      "Harris was born Nov. 13, 1930, in a two-room farmhouse near Walters, in southwestern Oklahoma, about 15 miles from the Texas line. The home had no electricity, indoor toilet or running water.",
      "At age 5 he was working on the farm and received 10 cents a day to drive a horse in circles to supply power for a hay bailer.",
      "He worked part-time as a janitor and printer\u2019s assistant to help for his education at University of Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1952, majoring in political science and history. He received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1954, and then moved to Lawton to practice.",
      "In 1956, he won election to the Oklahoma state Senate and served for eight years. In 1964, he launched his career in national politics in the race to replace Sen. Robert S. Kerr, who died in January 1963.",
      "Harris won the Democratic nomination in a runoff election against J. Howard Edmondson, who left the governorship to fill Kerr\u2019s vacancy until the next election. In the general election, Harris defeated an Oklahoma sports legend \u2014 Charles \u201cBud\u201d Wilkinson, who had coached OU football for 17 years.",
      "Harris won a six-year term in 1966 but left the Senate in 1972 when there were doubts that he, as a left-leaning Democrat, could win reelection.",
      "Harris married his high school sweetheart, LaDonna Vita Crawford, in 1949, and had three children, Kathryn, Byron and Laura. After the couple divorced, Harris married Margaret Elliston in 1983. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available Saturday."

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has selected former White House aide Brooke Rollins to lead the Department of Agriculture in his second administration.",
      "Here are some things to know about Trump\u2019s choice and the agency that Rollins would lead if she is confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Rollins, 52, graduated from Texas A&M University with an undergraduate degree in agricultural development before completing law school at the University of Texas. She served as domestic policy chief during Trump's first term, a portfolio that included agricultural policy. After leaving the White House, she became president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration.",
      "Over the years, Rollins has forged a strong enough relationship with Trump, who has prized proven loyalty in his Cabinet and top adviser picks, that she was among the people floated as a potential White House chief of staff. That job went to Susie Wiles, Trump's co-campaign manager.",
      "Rollins, in an interview earlier this year, called Trump an \u201camazing boss.\u201d",
      "President Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The sprawling department now reaches into every American neighborhood, grocery store and school cafeteria.",
      "The USDA is the primary agency overseeing the nation\u2019s farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition. The agency has a dual purpose of promoting and regulating agriculture practice and products. The agency oversees multiple support programs for farmers; animal and plant health; and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs that anchor the nation\u2019s food supply. Its federal nutrition programs provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children. And the department sets standards for school meals.",
      "Trump did not offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign. But if he keeps his pledge to impose sweeping tariffs, farmers could be affected quickly \u2014 and potentially harshly. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war.",
      "The ripple effects could extend to consumers\u2019 grocery bills, as well. When things are going smoothly, agriculture secretaries are not usually prominent faces of an administration. But when the nation\u2019s food supply is at issue, it could be another story.",

      "During the campaign, President-elect Donald Trump had hailed what would become Project 2025 as a conservative roadmap for \u201cexactly what our movement will do.\"",
      "WASHINGTON -- As a former and potentially future president, Donald Trump hailed what would become Project 2025 as a road map for \u201cexactly what our movement will do\u201d with another crack at the White House.",
      "As the blueprint for a hard-right turn in America became a liability during the 2024 campaign, Trump pulled an about-face. He denied knowing anything about the \u201cridiculous and abysmal\u201d plans written in part by his first-term aides and allies.",
      "Now, after being elected the 47th president on Nov. 5, Trump is stocking his second administration with key players in the detailed effort he temporarily shunned. Most notably, Trump has tapped Russell Vought for an encore as director of the Office of Management and Budget; Tom Homan, his former immigration chief, as \u201cborder czar;\u201d and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of policy.",
      "Those moves have accelerated criticisms from Democrats who warn that Trump's election hands government reins to movement conservatives who spent years envisioning how to concentrate power in the West Wing and impose a starkly rightward shift across the U.S. government and society.",
      "Trump and his aides maintain that he won a mandate to overhaul Washington. But they maintain the specifics are his alone.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump never had anything to do with Project 2025,\u201d said Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in a statement. \u201cAll of President Trumps' Cabinet nominees and appointments are whole-heartedly committed to President Trump's agenda, not the agenda of outside groups.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at what some of Trump's choices portend for his second presidency.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget director, a role Vought held under Trump previously and requires Senate confirmation, prepares a president's proposed budget and is generally responsible for implementing the administration's agenda across agencies.",
      "The job is influential but Vought made clear as author of a Project 2025 chapter on presidential authority that he wants the post to wield more direct power.",
      "\u201cThe Director must view his job as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President\u2019s mind,\u201d Vought wrote. The OMB, he wrote, \u201cis a President\u2019s air-traffic control system\u201d and should be \u201cinvolved in all aspects of the White House policy process,\u201d becoming \u201cpowerful enough to override implementing agencies\u2019 bureaucracies.\u201d",
      "Trump did not go into such details when naming Vought but implicitly endorsed aggressive action. Vought, the president-elect said, \u201cknows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State\u201d \u2014 Trump\u2019s catch-all for federal bureaucracy \u2014 and would help \u201crestore fiscal sanity.\u201d",
      "In June, speaking on former Trump aide Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, Vought relished the potential tension: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to save our country without a little confrontation.\u201d",
      "The strategy of further concentrating federal authority in the presidency permeates Project 2025's and Trump's campaign proposals. Vought's vision is especially striking when paired with Trump's proposals to dramatically expand the president's control over federal workers and government purse strings \u2014 ideas intertwined with the president-elect tapping mega-billionaire Elon Musk and venture capitalist Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency.\u201d",
      "Trump in his first term sought to remake the federal civil service by reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers \u2014 who have job protection through changes in administration \u2014 as political appointees, making them easier to fire and replace with loyalists. Currently, only about 4,000 of the federal government's roughly 2 million workers are political appointees. President Joe Biden rescinded Trump's changes. Trump can now reinstate them.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk's and Ramaswamy's sweeping \u201cefficiency\u201d mandates from Trump could turn on an old, defunct constitutional theory that the president \u2014 not Congress \u2014 is the real gatekeeper of federal spending. In his \u201cAgenda 47,\u201d Trump endorsed so-called \u201cimpoundment,\u201d which holds that when lawmakers pass appropriations bills, they simply set a spending ceiling, but not a floor. The president, the theory holds, can simply decide not to spend money on anything he deems unnecessary.",
      "Vought did not venture into impoundment in his Project 2025 chapter. But, he wrote, \u201cThe President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.\u201d",
      "Trump's choice immediately sparked backlash.",
      "\u201cRuss Vought is a far-right ideologue who has tried to break the law to give President Trump unilateral authority he does not possess to override the spending decisions of Congress (and) who has and will again fight to give Trump the ability to summarily fire tens of thousands of civil servants,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat and outgoing Senate Appropriations chairwoman.",
      "Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, leading Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, said Vought wants to \u201cdismantle the expert federal workforce\u201d to the detriment of Americans who depend on everything from veterans' health care to Social Security benefits.",
      "\u201cPain itself is the agenda,\u201d they said.",
      "Trump\u2019s protests about Project 2025 always glossed over overlaps in the two agendas. Both want to reimpose Trump-era immigration limits. Project 2025 includes a litany of detailed proposals for various U.S. immigration statutes, executive branch rules and agreements with other countries \u2014 reducing the number of refugees, work visa recipients and asylum seekers, for example.",
      "Miller is one of Trump's longest-serving advisers and architect of his immigration ideas, including his promise of the largest deportation force in U.S. history. As deputy policy chief, which is not subject to Senate confirmation, Miller would remain in Trump's West Wing inner circle.",
      "\u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only,\u201d Miller said at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally on Oct. 27.",
      "\u201cAmerica First Legal,\u201d Miller\u2019s organization founded as an ideological counter to the American Civil Liberties Union, was listed as an advisory group to Project 2025 until Miller asked that the name be removed because of negative attention.",
      "Homan, a Project 2025 named contributor, was an acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director during Trump\u2019s first presidency, playing a key role in what became known as Trump's \u201cfamily separation policy.\u201d",
      "Previewing Trump 2.0 earlier this year, Homan said: \u201cNo one\u2019s off the table. If you\u2019re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.\u201d",
      "John Ratcliffe, Trump's pick to lead the CIA, was previously one of Trump's directors of national intelligence. He is a Project 2025 contributor. The document's chapter on U.S. intelligence was written by Dustin Carmack, Ratcliffe's chief of staff in the first Trump administration.",
      "Reflecting Ratcliffe's and Trump's approach, Carmack declared the intelligence establishment too cautious. Ratcliffe, like the chapter attributed to Carmack, is hawkish toward China. Throughout the Project 2025 document, Beijing is framed as a U.S. adversary that cannot be trusted.",
      "Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, wrote Project 2025's FCC chapter and is now Trump's pick to chair the panel. Carr wrote that the FCC chairman \u201cis empowered with significant authority that is not shared\u201d with other FCC members. He called for the FCC to address \u201cthreats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market,\u201d specifically \u201cBig Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.\u201d",
      "He called for more stringent transparency rules for social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube and \u201cempower consumers to choose their own content filters and fact checkers, if any.\u201d",

Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the small business administration.",

    "summary": "The iconic carmaker's rebrand has certainly caught people's attention, but will it pay off?",
    "story": [
      "Jaguar has urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the carmaker.",
      "The company, embarking on the biggest change in its 102-year old history, released a new logo and a so-called \"social media tease\" this week, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in early December.",
      "The teaser video has faced backlash, with many critics pointing to the fact it doesn't feature an actual car. Others have praised the company for being bold and shaking things up.",
      "Either way, the rebrand has grabbed people's attention and Jaguar has since admitted it not only expected such debate - but it wanted it.",
      "In the 1960s, Jaguar launched the E-Type and XJ which have come to be known among some of the most iconic cars of all time.",
      "Now the company is trying to do the same again by unveiling its new \"design vision\" in Miami next month.",
      "Teasing the vision online, the 30 second advert features models in extravagant, brightly-coloured outfits who reveal the new company logo written as JaGUar.",
      "No cars, no suave men in suits, no big cats.",
      "\"Do you sell cars?\" was the response on X, from owner Elon Musk, who is also the boss of electric car firm Tesla.",
      "\"This is surely a joke?\" added one user, while another suggested the move would \"cost jobs and do real damage\". Some said \"Go woke, go broke\".",
      "Specsavers, known for its humorous social media manner, created a mock-up of its own logo in response, which looked like it had been created on Microsoft Paint.",
      "While supermarket Aldi chipped in at Jaguar's \"Copy Nothing\" slogan with: \"You sound like our legal team.\"",
      "Amid the anger and sarcasm, Jaguar has doubled down on its decision, replying to some posts with phrases such as \"To live is to evolve\".",
      "\"We had to break rules and do something that would get us cut thru,\" a spokesman told the BBC - suggesting this is all part of the plan.",
      "As Martin Brundle, the former Formula 1 racing driver turned broadcaster, put it:  \"I have no idea what this is all about, but it\u2019s genius.",
      "\"Everyone is talking about Jaguar in a moment of time when they\u2019re not actually making cars.\"",
      "'Maybe Jaguar wanted this response'",
      "Lee Rolston is the chief growth officer of global branding agency Jones Knowles Ritchie and has worked on rebrands of household names such as Burger King and the RSPCA.",
      "He was also part of the thinking to famously drop the donuts from Dunkin' to move \"to a first-name basis with America\", given it was also one of the country's the biggest coffee sellers.",
      "He says rebrands occur generally when a company wants to \"shift\" its business strategy, which is what Jaguar is doing in its move to electric-only cars.",
      "In an \"ideal world\" the rebrand leads to buzz and a positive reaction, Mr Rolston adds, but to achieve that you need to \"make sure people understand the context\".",
      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",

      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",
      "While Jaguar isn't changing its name, Mr Wells says the brand has taken a \"huge, bold step\" and people should give \"respect and time\" to see how things pan out.",
      "Mr Rolston said \"branding logic\" suggests companies \"lean into\" their current perception with the public, but Jaguar appears to have shunned that.",
      "\"Everything they have put out so far is not like a Jaguar. The question is, if it\u2019s not a Jaguar as you used to know it, what is it?\"",
      "Jaguar argues its rebrand can been traced back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons, that \"A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing\".",
      "'Something has to change'",
      "But it's clear, as Erin Baker, editorial director at AutoTrader puts it, that the carmaker is trying to ditch the \"sage\" image, that its cars are only for older, white men, who perhaps frequent golf clubs, or wear cravats and smoke cigars.",
      "\"It\u2019s been languishing in terms of sales for years now,\" she said. \"Something has to change fundamentally with the brand.\"",
      "But Ms Baker is a fan of the rebrand ad. \"I think it needs to really stir emotion, it needs to stir curiosity, get people asking questions,\" she says.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade, with The Range Rover and Defender behind the company's highest profits.",
      "Ms Baker believes Jaguar's radical rebrand is a final attempt to revive it. But what happens if it doesn't pay off?",
      "\"I am not sure what else they can do,\" adds Ms Baker. \"It\u2019s a very risky move to go pure electric in 2026 when sales of electric cars the world over have largely stalled amongst private buyers.",
      "\"But the truth is...no one has an idea if this is going to succeed or not.\"",

      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",
      "Some customers could immediately save \u00a3100 a year by moving from paying their bill every three months to paying by direct debit.",
      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",

      "Winter fuel payment debate",
      "The cap affects those on default, variable tariffs, not those who have fixed a price for a set period.",
      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",

      "Retail sales fell last month as shoppers held back on spending ahead of the Budget, according to official figures.",
      "Sales volumes fell by 0.7% in October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with clothing stores having a \"notably poor\" month.",
      "Speculation over which taxes might be increased ahead of last month's Budget has been cited as a reason why households and businesses were more reluctant to make spending decisions.",
      "While the drop was bigger than expected last month, the ONS said that wider trends showed sales had been sturdy.",
      "Sales volumes were up 0.8% in the August to October period when compared with the previous three months.",
      "\"When we look at the wider trend, retail sales are increasing across the three-month and annual periods, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels,\" said ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach.",
      "She said October's fall \"was driven by a notably poor month for clothing stores, but retailers across the board reported consumers held back on spending ahead of the Budget\".",
      "Sales at clothing stores were down 3.1% in October, with separate surveys having suggested that milder weather last month meant shoppers delayed buying warmer clothing.",
      "The retail sales figures are the latest in a run of disappointing data on the economy.",
      "Earlier this week, data showed higher-than-expected government borrowing, while the latest inflation figures showed prices rising faster than expected.",
      "And last week, figures indicated that the economy barely grew between July and September.",
      "Retailers have been among the most vocal of the businesses complaining about tax rises announced in last month's Budget.",
      "On Tuesday, many of the UK's biggest chains - including Tesco, John Lewis and Marks & Spencer - wrote to Chancellor Rachel Reeves to say that job losses in the sector were  \"inevitable\" and prices would rise because of the tax rises and other increasing costs.",

      "\"With half-term falling later this year and relatively mild weather, consumers have put off buying their winter coats and boots,\" she said.",

      "However, she added that with the Budget out of the way and interest rates coming down, this should \"help with confidence and create a clear runway for Christmas spending\".",
      "There was better news for retailers from a separate survey which suggested consumer confidence has improved this month.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 06:31:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Farmers have dominated the debate over changes to inheritance tax \u2013 but the issue is much wider than that.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers have dominated the debate over the recent Budget's change to inheritance tax \u2013 but the issue is much wider than that. Family businesses are affected in the same ways, and there are many more of them.",
      "As the implications dawn on many such families, there are warnings of lower investment, lower employment, lower growth and the potential takeover of a vital part of the economy by big, and often foreign, corporates.",
      "The change comes from the chancellor's decision to tax assets as they pass from one generation to another.",
      "For most people, that tax kicks in for assets worth more than \u00a3325,000, or \u00a3500,000 if the family home is being passed on.",
      "But for farmers and businesses, passing on assets from one generation to the next is currently tax free - and that tax relief has been unlimited.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to exempt the first \u00a31m of agricultural or business property. After that, it will be taxed at 20% - half the rate of inheritance tax required from others.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "It's not clear how many farmers that would affect. The Treasury estimates 500 per year; the National Farmers Union says it's closer to 70,000 in total.",
      "At least part of the wide difference may be explained by farmers also claiming Business Property Relief where their assets are in non-agricultural activity, such as holiday lets, a farm shop or a mail order company.",
      "The number of non-farm businesses affected by this is harder to gauge, but one rough estimate is that it could be about 20 times more.",
      "Scotland doesn't have as many middling-sized family businesses as other economies.",
      "But in some sectors, they play an important role - notably food processing.  Well-known brands such as Tunnock's, Baxter's of Fochabers and Walker's Shortbread are some of the larger ones.",
      "One of the reasons you may not have heard such a backlash against the new tax on inherited wealth is because it's just that - inherited wealth. These families don't get much sympathy for their tax breaks... or at least, not as much as farmers.",
      "The Grant family, distillers of Glenfiddich whisky, is reckoned by Forbes magazine to be worth about \u00a32.9bn. Inheritance tax on transferring that wealth is currently nil.  In future, it could be \u00a3580m.",
      "Some sectors are warning there could be unintended consequences from forcing families, in some cases, to turn a fifth of their assets into the cash necessary to pay HMRC.",
      "As with farmers, many of these businesses are capital intensive, while not generating big incomes.",
      "One of the sectors affected is plant hire and operation - the trucks, diggers and numerous other pieces of equipment that are required by construction and other sectors, including farming.",
      "Family firms account for 85% of the Scottish Plant Operators Association's 350 members. Plant hire has been largely unaffected by consolidation into larger firms.",
      "Requiring large, expensive capital assets, it is hard hit by a tax which targets the value of assets rather than their profitability. The new tax regime will not take into account the ability of firms to raise cash to pay.",
      "Former SPOA president Mark Anderson is managing director of GAP, the fourth largest plant hire operator in Britain.",
      "Based in Glasgow, it is now owned by the third generation of the family.  Mark's father and uncle are past retirement age, but still work within the business.",
      "The firm has 2,200 workers on the payroll. The most recent annual turnover reached \u00a3340m.",
      "Mark says that businesses like his can be loyal to workers and take long-term decisions, riding through the peaks and troughs of the business cycle.  Several of those on the staff have 40 years' experience, while two have more than 50.",
      "If the company were on the stock market or owned by a private equity fund, it would be under pressure for short-term results.",
      "\"Some of our assets take 10 years to deliver a return. These are assets that private equity won't go into because they don't get a return after a year,\" he says.",
      "Mark enjoys his job and likes the people that he works with.",
      "\"I have two daughters, and I wonder if, in the future, this is something my girls would want to go into.\"",
      "Handing over to his daughters is a long way off as they're only aged five and 10.",
      "But following the Budget three weeks ago, planning for succession has become a major source of uncertainty and future cost for businesses like GAP.",
      "There are ways of avoiding the tax, using existing loopholes. The main way is to gift assets to the next generation, on condition that you live for seven years after the transfer.",
      "Businesses seeking to limit their exposure to tax face making macabre judgements on the life expectancy of older members - or insuring against the death of younger ones, who could defy tax planning if they die young.",
      "In many cases, like with the Grant family of distillers, the wealth is split across siblings and cousins. As assets pass to the next generation, there may be a slightly lower tax bill because of the \u00a31m exemption per person.",
      "But the need to raise cash could force some family members to sell a share, and a lot of that could destabilise the firm.",
      "Ryan Scatterty is managing director of Thistle Seafoods near Peterhead, and is the fifth generation at the firm. It also has a processing unit in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, employs 800 people and has a \u00a3133m turnover.",
      "He says the seafood sector is dominated by family firms who are in a similar position to the farmers in the north east of Scotland who are protesting about the inheritance tax proposals.",
      "He says beneficiaries are unlikely to have the cash needed to pay HMRC, even with 10 years of installments.",
      "\"The only way to come up with that is to sell the business.  That could be to a large multinational, which could be foreign-owned, and without that commitment to the local community,\" he says.",
      "\"The question for the government is: do they want these sectors to be owned by giant multinationals?\"",
      "He also says the inheritance tax change is a disincentive to invest. If an investment was to increase a family firm's value by \u00a310m, he believes that the 20% tax bill at the point of death may no longer make it look financially viable.",
      "Paul Andrews, founder of Family Business United, says its members were shocked by the Budget.",
      "\"It's caused a lot of conversations around succession. The unintended consequences will be reduced investment,\" he says.",
      "Another membership organisation, Family Business UK, says it has been \"inundated\" by inquiries about membership and advice.",
      "The Treasury says Rachel Reeves made the choice to raise tax both to stabilise public finances and improve public services, and that her tax choices were to put an additional burden on businesses and those with wealth.",
      "Where tax revenue is required, it's easier to raise it from relatively wealthy people who have died than from income or consumer taxes on those with modest incomes.",
      "Chris Campbell - a tax specialist at Icas, the institute of chartered accountants in Scotland - says its members have been busy this month with approaches for advice.",
      "Businesses are hoping that the pressure beign applied by farmers could lead to a change of policy.",
      "\"They're having to re-think, but they're also waiting to see,\" he says.",
      "\"There's no indication of a U-turn, but the farmers' reaction may have an influence.\""

    "summary": "The charges could jeopardise the ambitions of one of the world\u2019s richest men, both at home and abroad.",
    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US.",
      "Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad.",
      "Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy.",
      "Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.",
      "India\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading  infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share),  seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market).",
      "With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide.",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.)",
      "\u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.",
      "This crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI.",
      "\u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC.",
      "For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects.",
      "\"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"",
      "The latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal.  \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC.",
      "What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "While the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong.",
      "\u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says.",
      "Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says.",
      "\"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d"

      "'I dread the post'",
      "In the spring I received an email from Sue Robertson, following an investigation I carried out into the overcharging of leaseholders. The email was among about 200 I was sent by homeowners who told me they were having issues with their service charges.",
      "Sue described how soaring charges and legal threats were affecting her finances and health. I replied and a few days later heard from her neighbour, who told me Sue was in hospital having tried to take her own life. After she had recovered, I went to meet her.",
      "At Sue's one-bedroom ground-floor flat in Worthing, West Sussex, she explained to me that it had once been her \"sanctuary\"  but was now causing her severe anxiety.",
      "In 2019, she was paying about \u00a3750 a year in service charges. Sue thought the fee was about right for her flat, which is one of two in a small converted house and has little shared space to maintain.",
      "But that year, the freehold to her property was sold at auction to a north London firm called Assethold. She says its sister company, Eagerstates, took over the management, after which her service charge more than doubled. By 2023, her bill was \u00a33,198 - an increase of 320% in four years.",
      "\"I dread the post,\" she told me.",
      "\u201cEvery time we get a new bill, it's got something different on it. I think they're just charging us money for nothing.\"",

      "Through analysis of about 140 official court documents from the past five years, the BBC has discovered that Assethold, through Eagerstates, has overcharged leaseholders by at least \u00a31,173,000. Despite this, and multiple complaints to the authorities, the leaseholders we've spoken to say nobody is listening.",
      "'Unbearably stressful'",
      "Sue\u2019s neighbour, James, 31, who lives in the flat upstairs, is also struggling to pay the service charge. When he saw an increased bill, he says he flew into \"absolute panic - my heart was racing and I just didn't know what to do. I thought: 'We can't live here any more.'\u201d",
      "Assethold said: \"We are deeply concerned to hear that residents have reported emotional and financial stress due to these matters.\"",
      "Sue and James argue their bills are \"massively\" inflated and contain oddities such as a charge of \u00a3719 to get a key cut, as well as an annual fee of \u00a3500 to clean a 140x125cm (55x49in) doormat area and \u00a3300 to clean council wheelie bins - both of which Sue and James say have never been done.",
      "James says the situation has become \u201cunbearably stressful\u201d for him and his partner. He says he\u2019s working extra hours and has had to borrow \u00a330,000 to pay the increased charges and to hire solicitors.",

      "It is a tribunal\u2019s purpose to determine whether service charges are \u201creasonable and payable\u201d, and not to rule on whether there was any wrongdoing. But by examining hundreds of pages of evidence, we have found several judges' comments that indicate a pattern of bad practice relating to Assethold.",
      "At the lower end of the scale, one judge agreed that \u201c\u00a3135 to change two light bulbs was excessive\". At the other end, we have found that tribunals have awarded sums of up to \u00a3100,000 back to leaseholders for \"unreasonable\" service charges.",
      "One tribunal heard how homeowners had been unable to sell their flats and had been \u201csignificantly affected (financially and psychologically)\u201d.  In this case, about \u00a338,000 of the combined service charge was deemed to be unreasonable.",
      "Assethold was described in court as a \u201cmultimillion-pound freehold company\u201d that had \u201csimply refused to co-operate\u201d with the process, behaviour that was referenced in many of the documents we examined from about 140 court tribunals.",

      "In one case typical of those the BBC investigated, a judge called the firm's tactics \u201cmalicious\u201d, referred to \u201caggressive letters\u201d it had sent and repeatedly commented on the company\u2019s poor management.",
      "Assethold said it was \"actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions\" and had implemented changes where necessary.",

      "The combined service charge for the 80-flat block was \u00a360,000 when she and her partner bought the property in 2016. Three years later, it was \u00a3250,000.",
      "Jane, who has an accountancy background, spent weeks going through invoices and says she came across numerous questionable charges, including more than \u00a338,000 to repair lifts that were only a year old. She says the block's leaseholders were also overcharged more than \u00a360,000 in electricity costs.",
      "Assethold said this was \"simply incorrect\", adding that it had credited \u00a320,000 to leaseholders and that future accounts \"will be reduced accordingly\".

      "Jane says the contractor, Superior Facilities Maintenance {SFM), has billed tens of thousands of pounds for poor-quality work at the building and Eagerstates pays up \"no questions asked\".",
      "Assethold said: \"Any works carried out would be backed up with images and an invoice. We do inspect the properties regularly and do speak to the contractor if any complaints are raised about the works.\"",
      "The BBC has seen dozens of invoices for work by SFM on other buildings, including Sue's and James\u2019s.",
      "Last summer they received a bill for \u00a34,500 from the company, via Eagerstates, for repairs to lead work on the roof. \u201cThey [the contractors] came for a short amount of time - I don\u2019t know what they did up there - then they charged us all that money for it,\u201d James says.",
      "Sue and James have shown me an invoice from SFM that shows they were charged for scaffolding, when they say only a ladder was used to access the roof.",
      "We tried to contact Superior Facilities Maintenance but the phone number listed online didn't connect and its website was defunct.",
      "Leaseholders have shown the BBC invoices that were issued by SFM through Eagerstates. The cost of the work detailed in them amounted to \u00a398,000 since 2022.",
      "We have discovered that SFM hasn't submitted accounts to Companies House, which is a criminal offence. According to Companies House, it has been sent six letters about this.",
      "By delving into the various tribunal documents, we have found other complaints about Eagerstates\u2019 use of SFM.",
      "In a recent case, a judge accepted there had been \u201ca lack of transparency\u201d when  SFM was employed to do roof repairs and said there were \u201csignificant concerns about the quality of the works\u201d. In this case, the judge disallowed almost all the \u00a321,000 charged by SFM.",
      "Assethold said: \"That is simply not the case and defamatory by the judge; there was clear transparency and copious correspondence between ourselves and the leaseholders about the contractor.\"",
      "SFM has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.",
      "'All contractors are bona fide'",
      "While a tribunal does not have powers make judgments on potential criminality or other possible wrongdoing, one judge said they were \u201cnot satisfied\u201d that an invoice provided by SFM, for \u00a31,750, was \u201cbona fide\u201d.",
      "Assethold said: \"That is simply not the case and defamatory by the judge; there was clear transparency and the invoice is bona fide. How a judge can say that with no evidence is absurd and we are considering making a complaint about the judge and these comments as there must be evidence to say this.\"",
      "That invoice was one of several questioned by Raymond Shaw.",
      "He is a leaseholder at a block owned by Assethold in Stratford, east London. He has 20 years' experience working as a criminal lawyer, specialising in fraud. Raymond says the way the company operates makes him \u201craise an eyebrow\".",
      "In 2018, the service charge was a little over \u00a3900 a year. The latest annual bill was for more than \u00a36,000 - a 560% rise.",
      "Assethold disputes the sums provided by Raymond, however he says he and his wife  spent \u201cweeks and months\u201d poring over their bills and looking into the companies Eagerstates works with. They say several are new and others close after a short period.",
      "They believe there are links between some of them, including family connections to the cleaning firm used at his flat block.",
      "Assethold said: \"This is simply not so; all contractors are bona fide and independent.\"",
      "Raymond says the block of 11 flats was charged \u00a310,000 for cleaning last year but the service is \u201catrocious\u201d and, despite the high cost, the building is filthy and bins aren\u2019t collected, causing a problem with rats and a terrible smell.",
      "Assethold said: \"Rubbish piles up due to various short lets and abuse by the residents which means waste is constantly dumped in the property.\"",
      "At a tribunal last year, Raymond and some of his neighbours were awarded back almost \u00a360,000 because of overcharging that took place over a three-year period.",
      "Assethold said \"This included mostly estimated charges, and we have refunded any monies to the leaseholders.\"",
      "'How can they take that away from me?'",
      "The advice given to leaseholders who dispute their service charge is to pay up and take the matter up later, or they could face losing their property in a process known as forfeiture - a measure described as \u201cdraconian\u201d by Sebastian O\u2019Keefe from the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership.",
      "Sue withheld some of her payment in protest over her charges and was threatened with a possession order by Eagerstates, meaning that if she didn\u2019t pay in full, it would start forfeiture proceedings to claim the entire value of her property.",
      "Sue says: \u201cI couldn't believe that. This is my flat, this is my home. How can they take that away from me? I've bought it, it\u2019s mine.",
      "\u201cI still can't cope with it. I get really upset about it.\"",
      "Ji Hoon Yoon, an Assethold leaseholder who won his legal dispute with the firm, is one of many people who have told me of issues with the tribunal system. \"There's nothing within the judicial system to link up all of these cases, even if they've done this time and time again,\" he says.",

I was in Worthing County Court last month when they discovered that Assethold hadn't registered the property to the Land Registry and so was not the legal owner of the freehold.",

    "summary": "The regulator Ofwat's new powers prevent bonuses being funded from customer bills.",
    "story": [
      "Three water firms have been directly blocked from using customer money to pay bonuses collectively worth \u00a31.6m.",
      "While some firms voluntarily used shareholder money to fund boss bonuses, Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Dwr Cymru Welsh Water were reprimanded by the regulator Ofwat for using customer funds.",
      "Ofwat said that any \"undeserved\" bonuses should be borne by owners and lenders to the companies.",
      "David Black, chief executive of Ofwat, said that water firms \"need to do more to rebuild public trust\".",
      "He said that by stopping customers from \"paying for undeserved bonuses\", it was looking \"to sharpen executive mindsets\" and to push firms to improve their cultures of performance and accountability.",
      "Ofwat said any bonuses paid out of customer funds would be deducted from future customer bills.",
      "Industry under review",
      "The regulator itself has often been criticised, with the Environment Secretary Steve Reed previously saying he believed the problems in the sector as a whole were ones of \u201cregulation and governance\u201d.",

      "That review is not due to report back until June next year.",
      "When questioned by the BBC's Today programme on why the public should trust Ofwat, Mr Black said Ofwat had changed the way it regulates the industry.",
      "\u201cWe have stepped in to protect customers' interests, we will continue to do so. The announcement today in terms of blocking chief executive bonuses from being recovered from customers is part of that,\u201d he said.",
      "Ofwat's new powers prevent bonuses being funded from customer bills if the company is judged to have missed environmental or performance targets.",
      "Thames Water chief executive Chris Weston, who was hired in January to try to turn around the fortunes of a company drowning in debts, was awarded a bonus of \u00a3195,000 for his first three months at the company, taking his total pay for the period to \u00a3437,000.",
      "It is not clear whether the bonus has in fact been paid out, but the regulator's rules now mean it cannot be paid by the operating company, and must be borne by the company owners.",
      "Thames Water declined to comment, while a Dwr Cymru spokesperson said the firm would \"take the necessary action as outlined in Ofwat\u2019s report\u201d.",
      "It admitted that its performance was \u201cnot as good\u201d as expected, but that its bonuses reflected \"other elements of good performance including strong customer service and financial performance\u201d.",
      "Yorkshire Water said it would reflect on the regulator\u2019s comments and that it understood the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d around executive pay.",
      "It said that during the summer it had reduced a 61.2% bonus to 42.2% for two of its bosses after an independent remuneration committee review took into account that \"the company\u2019s environmental performance not being where we wanted it to be\".",

    "story": [
      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has given more detail about plans to allow dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "It is consulting on two options, either extending the deadline to the end of May or until December 2025.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",

      "More social housing tenants could be stopped from buying their own homes as part of a shake up of Right to Buy policy.",
      "Under the proposals, tenants may have to wait more than ten years to buy their homes and those living in newly built social homes may never be able to buy.",
      "The government also wants to cut Right to Buy discounts back to pre-2012 levels and discourage social tenants from selling the homes they have bought.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said its changes will address the loss of social housing, but the Conservatives said Labour is \"limiting aspiration and social mobility\".",

    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",

      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 14:45:44 GMT",
    "summary": "The Mayor of London's free school lunch policy is praised by a new independent report.",
    "story": [
      "The Mayor of London has said his policy of free lunch for every pupil at state primary schools in London will continue despite questions about how he will pay for it.",
      "His free lunches for every primary school child scheme was praised by a new independent report that found it had brought \u201csignificant benefits\u201d for the capital\u2019s children, parents and schools.",
      "But the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee was told next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "Sadiq Khan told BBC London: \u201cAs long as I am mayor of this great city I will make sure we carry on with this fantastic policy.\u201d",
      "The scheme provided meals to 287,000 children in its first year, at a cost of \u00a3135m. It is currently in its second year, with the cost having risen to \u00a3140m.",
      "The policy is currently being budgeted for on a year-by-year basis.",
      "The mayor said: \"We will be publishing our budget in due course and setting out confirmation that this policy will carry on next year.\"",
      "He added: \"My promise to Londoners is for as long as I am mayor, children going to state primary schools will receive this offer of a universal free school meal.\"",
      "Khan was re-elected in May and his third term of office ends in May 2028.",
      "Speaking to the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, Richard Watts, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said \u201cthe scheme has been enormously successful\u201d and \u201call the benefits that we hoped we would see based on previous evidence we are now seeing city wide\u201d.",
      "However, he said next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "He said: \"The whole of the mayor\u2019s budget is \u00a3130m, we think free school meals will cost \u00a3140m next year so even if we canned everything else that we did, universal free school meals will never be met from the GLA (Greater London Authority) mayor budget.",
      "\"Therefore we will announce that funding in the group budget papers in due course.\u201d",
      "Khan launched the scheme in 2023 as a one-year emergency measure to help families with the cost of living, paid for using higher than expected business rate receipts.",
      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",
      "The committee heard that the GLA and mayor would have to wait until next year when the government is due to set out its multi-year plans for local government funding before setting budgets for the mayor\u2019s manifesto pledges.",
      "The mayor\u2019s chief of staff David Bellamy told the assembly\u2019s budget committee the free school meals scheme was \"not something substantively that the GLA mayoral budget has the resources to do, so that is something we will be dealing with in the group budget from the total income sources available to the mayor - we will set that out in the draft budget in January\u201d.",
      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",
      "The scheme had also been \u201cvalued highly by those working in schools\u201d, the report found, with senior leaders saying it had \u201chelped to address the problems of hidden hunger and food insecurity\u201d.",
      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",
      "Looking at the impact on pupils\u2019 performance in school, the report says that the policy \u201cappears to be supporting calmer behaviour in the classroom, with school staff reporting afternoon lessons running more smoothly when children have had a hot, healthy meal\u201d.",

      "The English National Opera has announced its first productions and plans for Manchester after being forced to relocate out of London.",
      "In 2022, the prestigious opera company was controversially told to leave the capital or lose its \u00a312m annual Arts Council England subsidy, as part of an attempt to \"level up\" arts funding.",
      "The ENO now says it will be \"firmly established\" in Greater Manchester by 2029.",
      "But it will start working in the city before that, with productions at the Lowry, Bridgewater Hall and Aviva Studios from 2025, and plans for a mass singing project with local grassroots football teams.",
      "It has announced:",

      "The football initiative, titled Perfect Pitch, will \"explore the impact that mass singing has on team performance and spectator experience\", the company said.",
      "ENO artistic director Annilese Miskimmon said the move would begin \"a bold and confident future for opera in the UK\".",

      "The productions staged in Manchester will range from \"larger scale traditional opera  to more experimental work to more intimate and chamber work\", and would allow the company to reach \"a wider range of audiences\", she said.",
      "'Disastrous first date'",
      "The announcements follow two years of turmoil for the company since the relocation demand was made.",
      "The Arts Council originally said it would effectively halve the ENO's grant even if it did agree to move, and gave the company until 2026 to relocate. But the Arts Council has since provided extra funds and extended that deadline.",
      "The ENO\u2019s initial reluctance to agree to the idea of a relocation led Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to tell them: \"If you can't come willingly, don't come at all.\"",
      "At a launch event on Thursday, he admitted the relationship between the company and the city had \"got off to an awkward or even mildly disastrous first date\", but said the ENO had proved they do want to be there.",
      "\"It was clear there was a meeting of minds and a partnership that's going to work for both sides,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The upheaval has led the ENO to make cuts to its orchestra and chorus, which are based in London. Members threatened to strike earlier this year over plans to make them all redundant and re-employ them for six months a year.",
      "The company's music director Martyn Brabbins resigned in protest at the cuts.",
      "The strike was eventually called off after the company agreed seven-month contracts.",
      "'Falls short'",
      "Even after moving its headquarters, the company will continue to stage annual seasons at its current home, the London Coliseum.",
      "The chorus and orchestra will perform in both London and Manchester, and the company will work with Manchester-based outfits like the Halle Orchestra and BBC Philharmonic, and local freelance musicians.",
      "Musicians' Union general secretary Naomi Pohl said it was \"certainly positive to see the artistic vision coming through in the announcement from ENO and we wish to see them flourish and grow\".",
      "She also welcomed the continued presence at the London Coliseum, and said she would \"keep an eye on the impact of ENO's work in Manchester on companies that already perform with musicians in that space\".",
      "Leeds-based Opera North currently tours to venues including the Lowry.",
      "\"Music is a delicate and complex ecosystem,\" Pohl added. \"Opera and ballet are under particular strain at the present time due to funding pressures and we are fighting to maintain full time jobs and pay.\"",
      "Paul Fleming, general secretary of arts union Equity, agreed that new opera productions and engagement programmes in Manchester were welcome, but said \"it falls short of a season at the scale audiences deserve\".",
      "\"Although the proposed innovative work will reach those who have not previously engaged with opera before, it does not offer the scale of production or stability of engagement that would lead to the protection and creation of secure jobs for the opera workforce,\" he said.",

      "Rosie Millard, a writer and broadcaster, accused the charity of \"institutional failure\" in her letter of resignation shared with the Times.",
      "Millard objected to \u00a3466,000 being awarded to LGBT Youth Scotland (LGBTYS) , a charity which supports young gay and transgender people.",
      "Its former chief James Rennie was convicted in 2009 of child sex assaults. The grants from Children In Need began seven months later, when the charity had new management in place.",
      "BBC News has not seen Millard's resignation letter.",
      "A Children in Need spokesman said: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of all children and young people.",
      "\"When allegations were made in relation to LGBT Youth Scotland their grant was immediately suspended with the full support of the board and a review began. In order to do this thoroughly and fairly the review took three months and culminated in the decision to withdraw funding.\"",
      "Rennie, who had been chief executive of LGBTYS from 2003 to 2008 and is also a previous SNP adviser, was jailed in 2009 after being revealed as a member of a paedophile ring.",
      "He was given a life sentence for sexually assaulting a three-month-old child and for conspiring to get access to children in order to abuse them. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 13 years, later reduced to eight on appeal.",
      "Rennie's crimes were found to have had no relation to or impact on the charity and were only uncovered by a police investigation. LGBTYS cut ties with him immediately and have said they \"condemn any actions which harm children and young people\".",
      "Children in Need suspended grants to the charity in May 2024, after Millard says she alerted them to his case. It withdrew funding around three months later following a review.",

      "She accused chief executive Simon Antrobus of failing to respond \u201cwith the necessary level of seriousness\u201d and hesitating to take action.",
      "She alleged that he eventually cut funding to the charity only because of fear of negative publicity.",
      "BBC News has contacted Millard for comment.",
      "Antrobus, who has been chief executive of Children In Need since 2016 and previously held senior positions at Parkinson's UK and Scope, has not publicly commented.",
      "Review of working methods",
      "Another man, who contributed to schools guidance put together by LGBT Youth Scotland, was convicted this year of sharing indecent images of children including some of newborn babies.",
      "Andrew Easton was a young person who attended services of LGBT Youth Scotland in the 2000s, and, as a result, contributed to a 2010 guide for young people about coming out. However, he was never an employee of the charity.",
      "He pleaded guilty in September to \u00adcommunicating online with someone he believed to be a child, downloading indecent images of children and distributing indecent images of children.",
      "He was sentenced to a community order, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, put on the sex offenders register for three years and told to take part in a sex offenders programme.",
      "In 2022, two men said that they were groomed at LGBTYS around the time Rennie was chief executive. In response, LGBTYS suspended a staff member and referred itself to the police.",
      "A Children in Need spokesman said: \"The Children in Need board of trustees are supportive of the actions taken by the CEO and senior leadership team and stand by the decisions made.",
      "\"Rosie at all times retained the board\u2019s support. In the wake of her resignation, in order to ensure any lessons learnt are captured, the trustees have instigated a review of ways of working between the board and executive in which Rosie has kindly agreed to participate.\u201d",
      "'Really gutted'",
      "Mhairi Crawford, chief executive of LGBTYS, said that Millard\u2019s resignation letter \u201cdemonstrates the ideologically driven nature of her attacks on our organisation\u201d.",
      "Crawford said: \u201cWe are pleased to see confirmation that Children in Need\u2019s investigations into the work of LGBT Youth Scotland found nothing to report.",
      "\u201cTime and time again, those with anti-inclusivity motives point to historic allegations in attempts to destroy our reputation. Allegations that have been investigated and cleared by Police Scotland, and proven to have had no link to our work.\u201d",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Thursday Crawford added she was \"really gutted\" to have lost funding from Children in Need.",
      "\"We worked with them [Children in Need] for the best part of 15 years, and it's really sad to see a funder choosing to take that line,\" she said.",
      "\"I understand why they've done it, and I respect it, but it's really sad that it happened, and really disappointing how it reached the press and how it communicated publicly.\"",
      "Tim Davie, the BBC's director general, praised Millard on Wednesday for her \u201csignificant impact on countless children\u201d. Children in Need raised more than \u00a339 million in its annual broadcast on Friday."

      "\"My little sister walked by, and she was like, \u2018Gigi, what was that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea, but I think it's really cool.'\"",
      "\"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\"",
      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",
      "But the chorus is undeniable.",
      "\"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\"",
      "Of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long.",
      "In the US, evangelical Christians criticised Sailor Song for the line: \"I don't believe in God, but you're my saviour.\"",
      "Gigi's response, posted to TikTok, was uncompromising.",
      "\"My songwriting is not a democracy,\" she wrote, \"and that applies to every artist's work.\"",
      "The singer's struggles with faith run deep.",
      "Her parents became born-again Christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for Gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in Florida.",
      "The experience was not all positive.",
      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",
      "In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable.",
      "\"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene.",
      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",
      "\"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched  on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says.",
      "\"And so I made it for myself.",
      "\"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\"",
      "That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it.",
      "\"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says.",
      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",
      "And with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before Gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms."

      "\"Situations like where there's a club and someone builds a block of flats next to it. Then people moan about the noise, when the venue was there first.",
      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",
      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

    "summary": "The adaptation of Broadway show Wicked has a star-studded cast of Ariana Grande and Jeff Goldblum.",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has told the BBC that she channelled her personal feelings of loss when filming Wicked.",
      "\"Losing someone you love is something we've all unfortunately had to experience - and sometimes we have the privilege to say goodbye and sometimes we don't,\" she says.",
      "Grande, 31, plays Galinda Upland in the film, which is an adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical exploring the Wizard of Oz universe from the perspective of two witches.",
      "The two-time Grammy award winner has suffered personal tragedy in recent years, after the 2017 Manchester bombing of her concert and the death of her former partner Mac Miller a year later.",
      "She says appearing in Wicked, one of the first Broadway shows she saw as a child, \"feels like a homecoming\".",
      "\"This music has always brought such comfort and now being able to spend time with it and be trusted with it is the privilege of a lifetime.\"",
      "In the weeks running up to the film's release, the close relationship between Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo has been in the spotlight.",
      "\"From the moment we were cast, Cynthia invited me over and we hung out for five hours and we laughed and we cried and got to know each other.",
      "\"We had a real conversation right off the bat about creating a safe space for each other and being honest with each other,\" she says.",
      "Grande and Erivo's characters begin in the Oz universe as university students, before later becoming enemies as Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Erivo, 37, has described her role as \"a real honour\" and nods to the foundations formed by the original stage actors Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, who she calls \"the architects\".",
      "\"We've been handed something really special and it's a dream come true and truly big shoes to fill,\" she adds.",
      "Mixed reviews",
      "Critics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\".",
      "There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara, who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\".",
      "However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films.",
      "The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\".",
      "\"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added.",
      "But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"",
      "Erivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple.",
      "She says she was able to draw on her own experiences of struggling with acceptance for the role of Elphaba, who is outcast for her green exterior.",
      "\"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says.",
      "Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.",
      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",
      "Its reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat.",
      "Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero.",
      "Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\".",
      "Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\".",
      "He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness.",
      "\"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"",
      "The musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever.",
      "\"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says.",
      "Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time.",
      "He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters.",
      "\"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds.",
      "\"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that.",

    "story": [
      "The Sidemen are used to making content for YouTube, but say they've now \"hit the limit\" on what they can achieve on the video sharing platform so are moving \"to something even bigger\".",
      "The British YouTube superstars have announced that the second season of their reality show, Inside, will debut on Netflix next year. The streaming giant will also make a US version.",
      "The Sidemen - the seven-strong group that includes content creator, rapper and boxer KSI - have more than 146 million YouTube subscribers between them.",
      "Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC the move was \"ambitious\" but it was \"exciting to conquer a new challenge\".",
      "He said: \"Netflix is the gold standard and part of us working with them is to say that over the past decade we've managed to go from filming content in our bedrooms to working with the biggest streaming platform in the world.\"",
      "The Sidemen started creating YouTube content in the early 2010s.",
      "They started by playing and reacting to video games, but in the past decade the group of friends have branched out to comedy sketches, travel challenges, podcasts and a dating show.",
      "They now employ a production team of more than 100 people who help create the videos and generate ideas, Vik said.",
      "One idea that has \"massively taken off\" is Inside, which launched in June on YouTube and racked up 14 millions of views for its opening episode.",
      "The contest's first season saw 10 influencers locked in a house for a week as they battled for a prize with up to \u00a31m.",
      "Its success caught the attention of Netflix bosses, who have now commissioned a second UK season and a US version of the show. Both will be on Netflix instead of YouTube.",
      "'Connect with new audiences'",
      "\"YouTube opened so many doors for us so we can't diminish its power and it's still unrivalled in some ways,\" Vik explained. \"But working with Netflix is a cool opportunity for us to reach a new audience.",
      "\"We're at a ceiling with YouTube - we bring in 20 million UK viewers each month and now we're thinking about how to connect with different people.\"",
      "Aside from Vik and KSI, the other Sidemen are Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga and W2S.",
      "Vik said the group, who are aged between 27 and 32, had some reservations about bringing their work to a new platform because \"we've never done it before and we're all very particular about the way we work\".",
      "\"We also move at a really fast pace - sometimes we shoot on Wednesday and by Sunday we will have uploaded a two-hour video. So we wanted to make sure Netflix were happy with the fast turnarounds and us being very dynamic.\"",
      "But the seven members vote on everything and were unanimous in the decision to move their reality show to Netflix, he said.",
      "The group will serve as executive producers and have \"full control to make the new season bigger and better than the last\".",
      "They aren't the only online stars to take their own big-money game show to a conventional streaming platform instead of putting it on YouTube.",
      "MrBeast, the world's most popular YouTuber, will launch Beast Games on Amazon Prime Video on 19 December, although that show has been at the centre of controversy.",
      "As one of the UK's biggest YouTube content creators, 29-year-old Vik is very aware of how many young men look up to him. But he said it's not his job to be a role model.",
      "\"In our videos we're just ourselves, we're not aiming to be certain characters, and first and foremost we're content creators who make fun videos.\"",
      "He added that the Sidemen had a \"unified stance on not speaking about political and social issues\".",
      "\"Sometimes we feel pressure to, but we would rather leave this to the experts.\"",
      "Part of the reason for this decision is the intense media scrutiny they face.",
      "KSI recently faced backlash after he shared a video of Donald Trump drinking a bottle of Prime, an energy drink he co-founded.",
      "Some saw that as promoting and supporting Trump ahead of the US election. However, Vik responded by saying the group \"try not to over analyse things\".",
      "\"Everything we do will always upset a small group of people but you just have to move forward,\" he said.",
      "'People thought I was weird'",
      "The Sheffield-based creator also said the group had got better at \"ignoring the trolling and hate\".",
      "\"The internet has become a very turbulent place recently and occasionally things do get to us.",
      "\"We try and just think about how proud we are of everything we've built and that helps us cancel out the negativity.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:49:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

    "summary": "The band scored a hit album named after an 8ft fibreglass gorilla and are finishing a sold-out tour.",
    "story": [
      "After scoring their latest number one with an album named after an eight-foot fibreglass gorilla called Gary, Manchester band Blossoms are doing a victory lap of their home city - with five sold-out gigs in five different venues in five nights.",
      "Musical inspiration can strike any time and anywhere.",
      "Few rock frontmen, though, would have been open to receiving it while in a car listening to a news report about the theft of a giant model gorilla from a Scottish garden centre.",
      "Tom Ogden wrote an indie-pop anthem about the incident, then dedicated their fifth album to the unfortunate inanimate ape.",
      "\"I'm under the impression that anything can be a song, if you approach it in the right manner,\" Ogden reasons.",
      "\"And 10 years in, you're always looking for new things to write about.",
      "\"I found the story entertaining when I heard it on the radio, so just as a laugh I went away [and said] I'm going to write a song about it.",
      "\"I mean, if the song wasn't very good, it would have never seen the light of day. But I rated the song.\"",
      "To Blossoms, Gary has now become muse and mascot, spirit animal and unofficial sixth member of the band.",
      "Both the song and the replica of Gary that the group have taken on tour are fan favourites.",
      "Some would also call it a gimmick, which is partly true, except that not even Ogden could seriously have calculated that the song and the story behind it would really catch on.",
      "\"It has connected with people,\" the singer says. \"I didn't anticipate it, but I knew I wanted to have something that made people go, what's that?",
      "\"Even if people think it is ludicrous, it's an entry point. And people were just ready for a bit of fun, I suppose.",
      "\"You can sense there's something in there which has connected with people for all ages. There are kids who love Gary, and then you've got our age, and then you've got older people.",
      "\"If you come to our shows, you'll see all different ages jumping along and singing to this song.",
      "\"I underestimated people's appetite for the ludicrous, maybe.\"",
      "Watch Blossoms perform on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland",
      "Watch Blossoms perform on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland",
      "A decade into their careers, and with four number one albums, Blossoms are serious enough to have the confidence to be ludicrous.",
      "They have also thrown off the indie shackles on a special edition of Gary featuring cover versions of songs by acts ranging from Bob Marley to Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston.",
      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",
      "\"I took that as a huge compliment, because I love Wham!\" Ogden says.",
      "Thick skin",
      "However, the same critic also dismissively described Gary as an \"ultra-shallow album\".",
      "\"I think if you call an album Gary, and you write a song about a fibreglass gorilla, you're out in the open, in terms of someone's going to say something like that,\" the singer responds.",
      "\"But I think there is depth on the album, of course, because there are songs like Mothers, which is about friendship and growing up. And then Why Do I Give You The Worst Of Me? is a very personal song.",
      "\"So I think someone's just thought, yeah, there's a song about fibreglass gorilla, maybe that's a bit of fun. And I Like Your Look\u2019s not taking itself too seriously either.",
      "\"And do you know what, you can\u2019t please everybody so... I don't really care, to be honest.",
      "\"You've got to learn to grow thick skin in this [business]. But I understand if they're saying it because we called the album Gary.",
      "\"Like, fair enough, whatever, man.\"",
      "In August, Blossoms played their biggest headline gig yet, to 30,000 people at Wythenshawe Park in Manchester.",
      "Massive outdoor shows don't always live up to expectations.",
      "In 2019, the band took over Edgeley Park, the home of Stockport County FC, in the Greater Manchester town where they grew up.",
      "\"We only had two albums, and maybe it felt like we weren't as good live, basically, as we are now,\" Ogden reflects.",
      "\"We feel like we\u2019re at the peak of our powers this year.\"",
      "Wythenshawe Park was the \"best gig we've ever done\", he says.",
      "\"We put everything into that show, and in no way did it feel disappointing. It blew us away even more than we expected.\"",
      "After that, when the band came to plan a full UK tour, they weren't sure whether to play in Manchester again.",
      "However, they decided they would - not once but five times, all at different venues of different sizes, and all of which they have played at before at different stages of their careers.",
      "Their mini one-city tour starts at Manchester Academy on Tuesday before visiting the Ritz, Albert Hall, Victoria Warehouse and Apollo.",
      "\"We thought it would be nice to play all the venues that we\u2019d played on the way up and make a week of it, and make it a bit more interesting for the fans,\" Ogden says.",
      "They are all places that hold fond memories for the band.",
      "\"The Ritz was the first big headline show we did in, when we felt like, oh, something's definitely happening here. We sold that out before we had a record deal and was the first time fans were singing and moshing around.",
      "\"I remember going to watch bands at the Academy - I remember watching Jake Bugg there, and I watched Miles Kane there when I was 15 or 16, so I always have a soft spot for that place.",
      "\"And then when we then headlined it in 2016 when our [first] album came out, it felt like, oh yeah, we're part of the big boy [club].",
      "\"The Albert Hall is just a beautiful venue, so the memories of that place are great. We support the Charlatans in the Albert Hall in 2015 and we then headlined it ourselves in 2016.",
      "\"The memories are in the walls of what you were doing last time,\" he adds.",
      "\"You've got to be grateful that you're still around, and people care about the band so much that we can fill all of these places one night after another.\"",

      "Travellers are being warned of the dangers of methanol poisoning after six tourists to Laos have died.",
      "Methanol is an industrial chemical found in antifreeze and windshield washer fluid.",
      "It's not meant for human consumption and is highly toxic.",
      "Drinking even small amounts can be damaging. A few shots of bootleg spirit containing it can be lethal.",
      "What does methanol do to you?",
      "It looks and tastes like alcohol, and the first effects are similar - it can make you feel intoxicated and sick.",
      "Initially, people might not realise anything is wrong.",
      "The harm happens hours later as the body attempts to clear it from the body by breaking it down in the liver.",
      "This metabolism creates toxic by-products called formaldehyde, formate and formic acid.",
      "These build up, attacking nerves and organs which can lead to blindness, coma and death.",
      "Dr Christopher Morris, a senior lecturer at Newcastle University, said: \"Formate, which is the main toxin produced, acts in a similar way to cyanide and stops energy production in cells, and the brain seems to be very vulnerable to this.",
      "\"This leads to certain parts of the brain being damaged. The eyes are also directly affected and this can cause blindness which is found in many people exposed to high levels of methanol.\"",
      "Of the victims so far, five of the six have been women.",
      "Toxicity from methanol is related to the dose you get and how your body handles it.",
      "As with alcohol, the less you weigh, the more you can be affected by a given amount.",
      "Dr Knut Erik Hovda from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which tracks methanol poisonings, says awareness varies a lot among tourists and healthcare staff in different parts of the world - and that could mean delays in diagnosing it.",
      "\"The symptoms are often so vague until you get really sick,\" he told the BBC.",
      "How is methanol poisoning treated?",
      "Poisoning is a medical emergency and should be treated in hospital.",
      "There are drug treatments that can be given, as well as dialysis to clean the blood.",
      "Some cases can be treated using alcohol (ethanol) to outcompete the methanol metabolism. But this has to be done quickly.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, an expert in environmental toxicology from the University of Leeds, explained: \"Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor largely preventing methanol breakdown, but markedly slowing it down, allowing the body to vent methanol from the lungs and some through the kidneys, and a little through sweat.\u201d",
      "Dr Hovda said getting help quickly after consuming methanol was crucial to chances of surviving.",
      "\"You can ease all affects if you get to hospital early enough and that hospital has the treatment needed,\" he said.",
      "\"You can die from a very small proportion of methanol and you can survive from a quite substantial one, if you get to help.",

      "Dr Hovda said methanol was mixed into alcohol \"mostly for profit reasons, because it's cheaper and easily available\".",

    "story": [
      "The NHS in England came within \u201csix or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said.",
      "The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems.",
      "He stated there was never a \u201cnational shortage\u201d of PPE for healthcare workers but \u201cin some places, they did run out - and it was awful\u201d.",
      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",
      "On Thursday, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives.",
      "'Left to die'",
      "Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid.",
      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 09:29:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The deaths of five tourists after apparently drinking tainted drinks highlight the wider issue of bootleg alcohol.",
    "story": [
      "Suspected methanol poisoning from tainted drinks has reportedly killed six tourists in a Laos holiday town in the past fortnight.",
      "A British woman, two Australian women, a US man and two Danish nationals have died. The deaths remain under police investigation, but reports suggest they may have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulation in food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml or half a shot can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It mainly affects poorer countries- outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as the hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",
      "\"You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 it\u2019s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent,\" one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.",
      "They said methanol poisonings were frequently reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",
      "\"I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists - that's not good for them or their industry either,\" the diplomat said.",
      "\"It's more about the production side \u2013 there being being low education, low regulation, people cutting corners.\"",
      "What can be done about it?",
      "Some campaigners have sought to raise attention to the dangers before. Australian man Colin Ahearn runs a Facebook page called 'Don't Drink Spirits in Bali' where he warns against mixed drinks like cocktails or drinks made from opened bottles of spirits.",
      "He told Australian media earlier this week that his page used to receive a submission a week about methanol poisoning across South East Asia.",
      "The diplomat said the risks of bootleg alcohol are well known among tourism operators and embassies, but a high-profile campaign is needed to inform tourists.",
      "\"This horrific event will probably help educate people, but not solve the cause of the problem,\u201d they added.",
      "Several Western governments updated their advice about alcohol dangers in South East Asia on their consulate and travel pages this week.",

      "Cassandra, who stumbled on a Facebook article linking cancer and talc following her diagnosis, said it was used on her as a baby and she continued to use it \"for 20 years or more\".",
      "\"You mimic your mum who used it,\" she said. \"Baby powder was supposed to be something deemed 'safe to use', even on a baby's bum.\"",
      "If it proceeds, the legal action would be the first of its kind brought against the pharmaceutical multinational in the UK.",
      "With 1,900 potential claimants, including cancer patients, survivors and families, lawyers say it is set to be the largest pharmaceutical product group action in English and Welsh legal history.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of women with gynaecological cancers - many are part of the group action - who believe their repeated use of talcum powder played a part in their diagnosis.",
      "Their lawyers allege that for decades, talcum powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos - something they claim J&J was aware of but sought to suppress.",
      "J&J denies suppressing any information and denies any links between its baby powder, asbestos and cancer.",
      "\"The doctors said the cancer was unusual for my age at 44,\" says Cassandra, from Alfreton in Derbyshire.",
      "She says she would regularly use talcum powder after a bath or as a deodoriser, including across her genitals.",
      "\"I was just starting my chemo journey when I read about the links, but I felt enraged that a corporate giant like J&J could seem to do this,\" she says.",
      "At first, doctors believed Cassandra's cancer was terminal.",

      "\"I closed down my business unit and laid off staff.",

      "Cassandra survived. But the disease still had a devastating effect on her life.",
      "She was forced to give up her business, and an infection during chemotherapy damaged her vocal cords, reducing her voice to a whisper. A hysterectomy to remove cancerous tissue had a huge impact on her body.",
      "\"I was plunged into surgical menopause,\" she says.",
      "\"I would have liked children. I was never blessed that way, but my last ability to have children was taken away due to cancer.\"",
      "Are there links between talcum powder and cancer?",
      "The claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known carcinogen.",
      "Talc is a mineral that is sometimes used in talcum powders and other cosmetic products, according to Cancer Research UK.",
      "Sophia Lowes, from the charity, said: \"[Talc] can be mined in places where there is asbestos, which can cause the talc to become contaminated. Asbestos is known to cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary.",

      "Many documents were hidden from public view until Americans with cancer began suing the firm.",
      "J&J has been accused of knowing decades ago that its baby powder could contain contaminants of asbestos.",
      "J&J has previously said that \"any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false\".",
      "The company discontinued mineral-based talc in North America in 2020 - and followed suit in the UK last year - replacing it with cornstarch. J&J said this was due to financial pressures and a \"misinformation campaign\" around the product.",
      "While the focus of the group action is on the contamination of talc with asbestos, in July this year the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that mineral talc itself was \"probably carcinogenic for humans\".",
      "Deborah, who did not want to be identified by her real name, also lives in Derbyshire, and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 29, just two weeks after she and her husband had started trying for a baby.",

      "\"Within two weeks of the first symptoms, I'd had a full hysterectomy,\" she says.",
      "\"I went from excitedly planning for a baby to having all of my parts removed.\"",

      "KP Law, representing the claimants, has begun the process of litigation, which is expected to start at the beginning of 2025.",
      "In the US, the firm has been sued by more than 62,000 people and at least $13bn has been paid out or set aside in response to the action.",
      "Cases there have seen the company found liable for mesothelioma - an asbestos-specific cancer - and gynaecological cancers women suffered after using talc, with billions of dollars awarded in damages.",
      "'Entirely transparent'",
      "Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, says: \"The case has been litigated repeatedly in the American judicial system but women in the UK deserve an answer, and compensation, here.",
      "\"Asbestos cancers tend to have a latency of around 10 to 40 years. So we are walking into a wave of women reaching an age where asbestos cancers develop.\"",
      "Mr Longstaff's firm sent a pre-action letter to J&J in September, a necessary step before starting proceedings. If the case goes ahead, it would likely end up in court next year.",
      "In response, Erik Haas - worldwide vice-president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the allegations against the company \"defy logic, rewrite history and ignore the facts\".",
      "\"J&J takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has,\" he says.",
      "\"As our documents show, we have relied upon the most state-of-the-art testing protocols for decades and have been entirely transparent with government institutions and academic researchers regarding our findings.\"",
      "Mr Haas also said the idea that J&J hid the contaminated contents of its products from the public, government and other groups was \"inconceivable and false\".",

      "The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would allow some terminally-ill people to have a medically-assisted death, is set to be debated by MPs on Friday next week.",
      "Labour MP Kim Leadbeater has introduced the bill, saying it could prevent harrowing deaths, following a long campaign by supporters of the position, including Esther Rantzen, who believe the law needs to be changed.",
      "Brown told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that \"people want to know what the evidence is for the scale of the challenge\", and called for more debate on the issue.",
      "'I might be dead before a decision is made': Terminally ill people on assisted dying",
      "Assisted dying could lead to coercion - Streeting",
      "No pressure on MPs over assisted dying vote, says PM",
      "Brown stood down as MP in 2015 so will not get a vote but his voice still carries weight in the Labour Party.",

      "Brown joins health secretary Wes Streeting, justice secretary Shabana Mahmood and the two longest-serving MPs in the Commons in speaking out against the bill - although many MPs' views remain unknown.",
      "In an opinion column for the Guardian on Friday, Brown writes of the death of his first daughter, Jennifer Jane, aged only 11 days, and how this strengthened his belief \"this is not the right time to make such a profound decision\".",
      "\"The experience of sitting with a fatally ill baby girl did not convince me of the case for assisted dying; it convinced me of the value and imperative of good end-of-life care,\" he said.",
      "Calling for a commission on palliative care, Brown acknowledged that both sides in the assisted dying debate share a common concern and \"genuine compassion felt for all those suffering painful deaths\".",
      "But with \"the NHS still at its lowest ebb\", he said \"we need to show we can do better at assisted living before deciding whether to legislate on ways to die\".",
      "He added: \"An assisted dying law, however well intended, would alter society\u2019s attitude towards elderly, seriously ill and disabled people, even if only subliminally, and I also fear the caring professions would lose something irreplaceable \u2013 their position as exclusively caregivers.",
      "\"Add to that the slippery slope with lawmakers, undoubtedly out of compassion, finding the erosion of safeguards and the extension of eligibility hard to resist.\"",
      "In his interview with the BBC's Sunday programme, Brown echoed many of the points raised in the opinion column, and called for citizens' assemblies - where a group is brought together to learn about and discuss a particular issue - to help peoples' understanding.",
      "\"People want to know what the evidence is for the scale of the challenge,\" he told host Julie Etchingham, adding: \"I don't think we\u2019ve had this debate in full, in this country yet.\"",
      "Brown is a longstanding critic of assisted dying, and in a 2008 interview with the Archbishop of Westminster told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme he was \"totally against laws\" allowing assisted suicide or euthanasia, saying they could put vulnerable people under pressure.",
      "In the BBC interview, Brown also spoke about how his faith has informed his life and beliefs, saying: \"I see life as a gift. I see it as something to be valued.\"",
      "He added that while religious views came into his stance on the issue, \"it's important to put the secular argument that people can understand - that it is possible to avoid so much of the pain that people are experiencing and we haven\u2019t invested enough in doing that\".",
      "MPs last considered the issue of assisted dying in parliament in 2015, after Brown had stepped down as an MP, when plans to change the law were overwhelmingly rejected.",
      "Public opinion shows a majority support of changing the law, with the latest YouGov poll showing 73% of Britons support allowing assisted dying in principle.",
      "Campaigning for both sides continues in the run-up to Friday's vote, which will be the first public expression of MPs' support.",
      "With a week to go for minds to change and hundreds of new MPs who have never put their views on the record, the result is difficult to predict, although there are some indications it could be close.",

      "Many of the claims from the government have been hotly contested by farmers, and BBC Verify has come under scrutiny over some of the figures it has relied on to try to establish the number of farms impacted by the change.",
      "The debate has revolved around estimates provided by farmers\u2019 groups, including that the new tax could \"harm\" up to 70,000 farms over time.",
      "Our analysis found that the figure was likely to be somewhere closer to the number provided by the government - about 500 estates per year. That remains our assessment.",
      "Farmers' groups say the changes have been \u201cbuilt on bad data\u201d. The government says it wants to make the inheritance tax system fairer and discourage wealthy people from investing in land solely to avoid the tax.",
      "Here, we go through all the numbers and examine the claims and counter-claims.",
      "What are the contested figures?",
      "Under the government\u2019s plans, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be subject to inheritance tax at 20%.",
      "The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has estimated that the tax change  \u201ccould harm\u201d 70,000 UK farms. This would represent roughly 33% of the 209,000 UK farms, as identified by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "The CLA figure is not an annual one and, clearly, a farm would only be potentially subject to inheritance tax if it was passed on, following a death.",
      "The government, in trying to assess the impact of its tax change, looked instead at recent figures for the number of actual claims for tax relief for agricultural estates.",
      "At this point, it\u2019s worth stressing that an agricultural estate is not the same as a landed estate, or farm: an \u201cestate\u201d is a legal term for the value of the money, property and possessions an individual passes on upon their death. In this case, it\u2019s an estate that includes some agricultural land.",
      "The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has claimed up to about 520 inherited agricultural estates a year \u201cwill be impacted to some extent by these changes\u201d.",
      "The Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said \"three quarters of farmers will pay nothing as a result of the changes\u201d.",
      "But farming groups continue to dispute the government figures, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) pointing to other figures from Defra which it says \u201cshow that only 34% of farms are under \u00a31 million net worth\u201d. This would imply that around two thirds of farms could potentially be affected by the Budget tax change.",
      "The NFU has also released analysis which it says shows that \u201caround 75% of commercial family farms will be above the \u00a31 million threshold\u201d.",
      "Below, we look into the challenges when it comes to reaching an exact conclusion on the numbers affected, and provide more detail on which figures are more reliable - and explain why.",
      "Is Defra data more accurate?",
      "Farming groups have partially based their arguments against the tax change on data from Defra\u2019s Farm Business Survey, which shows the net worth of farms in England in 2022/23.",
      "The figures suggest that 17% of farms in England have a net worth - the difference between their assets and liabilities - of between \u00a31m and \u00a31.49m. Another 49% of farms have a value of \u00a31.5m and over.",
      "This suggests, on the face of it, that 66% of farms in England could potentially be affected by the tax changes.",
      "However there are some problems with this calculation, as the data from the Defra survey is not necessarily representative of the overall UK-wide farming sector.",
      "The survey - which is based on a sample of just over 1,350 farms  - states that it is designed to be representative of only about half of the farms in England (rather than the rest of the UK) and also excludes farms which bring in little revenue.",
      "Moreover, the Defra data shows estimates of individual farm values, but does not show their ownership.",
      "Multiple farms can be owned by a single person who then lets them out to tenants. In England about 46% of agricultural holdings were wholly or partially rented out to tenant farmers in 2023 according to Defra data. If the owner of multiple farms sought to pass on those farms upon his or her death, this would all show up in a single estate in the inheritance tax relief claim.",
      "The financial impact would be on that individual\u2019s inheritance tax bill, not each farm.",
      "A farm could also be jointly owned by multiple people. If, for example, five people owned a \u00a35m farm they could each pass on their \u00a31m share without their estates having to pay any inheritance tax.",
      "This is why it is more appropriate to use tax data on inheritance relief, rather than farm survey data, to estimate the impact of the change in the Budget on individuals.",
      "Does including business property relief change the picture?",
      "Another challenge is that some initial government calculations of the number of estates likely to be affected only referred to Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and not Business Property Relief (BPR).",
      "APR relates mainly to the value of land. BPR can include a farm's machinery and livestock, which can also make up a significant proportion of the value of an agricultural estate.",
      "It is true that both APR and BPR relief will be capped at a combined \u00a31m for inheritance tax purposes, meaning a single estate will be able to claim no more than \u00a31m in these combined reliefs.",
      "Farming groups have claimed that farmers often also use BPR so any calculation of the impact of the tax changes based solely on APR claims will not capture the full effect on farming estates.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "However, the government has now published figures based on HMRC inheritance tax data which incorporate historical APR and BPR relief claims, and should capture those agricultural estates making use of both reliefs.",
      "These figures suggest that while taking BPR into account as well as APR does push up the number and proportion of estates likely to be affected, it does not fundamentally change the picture.",
      "The data shows that in 2021-22 the number of estates making combined APR and BPR claims where the value of the estate was more than \u00a31.5m was 383, or 22% of all claims.",
      "The number of estates worth more than \u00a31.5m making APR claims solely was 278, or 16% of the total.",
      "Why is it \u00a31.5m and not \u00a31m?",
      "The government\u2019s latest figures break down the impact using the threshold of \u00a31.5m, not \u00a31m, explaining to BBC Verify that this was chosen based on the assumption that an individual estate\u2019s standard inheritance tax reliefs of \u00a3500,000 would be added to their new \u00a31m allowance.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury and HMRC for a breakdown of the figures using \u00a31m as a threshold - which would be consistent with its original calculations showing APR claims only - but it said it hasn't collated those figures.",
      "The CenTax think tank has studied the impact of APR and BPR reliefs.",
      "CenTax\u2019s co-director Arun Advani argues that the government\u2019s estimates of the number of agricultural estates likely to be affected by the capping of both reliefs at \u00a31m combined - up to 520 estates a year - seems reasonable.",
      "\u201cThe data on historic claims are a much more reliable guide to the number of affected estates than surveys of farm sizes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhile the government's reforms are certainly likely to be difficult for some farmers, particularly given the many other factors weighing down farmer's incomes, numbers claiming tens of thousands will be affected aren't consistent with the evidence.\u201d",
      "David Sturrock from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies also said that the Treasury\u2019s figures were \u201ccredible\u201d and added that including the impact of capping BPR \u201cdoesn\u2019t radically change the picture in terms of estates affected\u201d.",
      "The NFU has pointed out that if 500 estates were affected per year that could amount to 15,000 over 30 years - but this would still be some way short of the 70,000 figure.",
      "Should small estates be excluded from calculations?",
      "The NFU argues that many estates included in the government figures are too small to be considered working farms.",
      "Its case is simple - if you were to exclude these small farms, the percentage of real, working farms affected would be much higher.",
      "It has pointed to separate APR inheritance tax relief claims data from HMRC, via the Treasury, which breaks down estates by size.",
      "This shows that in 2021-22, 474 claims (27% of the 1,730 total) were for estates valued between \u00a30 and \u00a3250,000, and that 398 (23% of the total) were for estates valued at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000.",
      "\u201cVery few viable farms are worth under \u00a31m,\u201d says the NFU president Tom Bradshaw.",
      "That's a reasonable argument.",
      "If estates with a value below \u00a3500,000 were excluded from the APR figures, the share of the total affected each year would automatically rise from the 27% implied by the government\u2019s initial calculations.",
      "The NFU\u2019s analysis suggests only including what it categorises as \u201cworking farms\u201d would increase the share affected from 27% to 49%.",
      "However, the estimated absolute number of affected estates - roughly 500 in each year - would not be affected by that change.",
      "Is there a \u00a33m allowance?",
      "A key question is where the effective financial inheritance tax threshold for estates with agricultural assets kicks in.",
      "Farming groups have suggested the value of any inherited estate with agricultural assets over \u00a31m will be impacted.",
      "This is understandable as this was the threshold figure cited in the Budget.",
      "However, the government has since claimed that the effective threshold for many farmers\u2019 estates to pay inheritance tax could be not \u00a31m, but \u00a33m, because of various inheritance tax reliefs available to estates.",
      "A higher effective threshold would have a major impact on the proportion and number of estates affected.",
      "The overnment\u2019s claim is based on the fact that the estates of farmers, like the estates of everyone else subject to inheritance tax, are eligible for a standard tax-free allowance, known as a nil-rate band, of \u00a3325,000.",
      "They are are also eligible for the residential nil-rate band of \u00a3175,000. The latter is available to people who are passing on a main residence to a direct descendant, such as children or grandchildren, as part of their estate. Together these two allowances total \u00a3500,000.",
      "This is on top of the \u00a31m tax-free allowance for agricultural estates.",
      "It\u2019s not just the \u00a31.5m allowance for a single individual - for anyone married their spouse has a similar effective allowance. Adding these together - and allowing for the ability of farming couples to share their allowances - does create a potential for some farming estates to pass on \u00a33m entirely free of inheritance tax.",
      "However, importantly, this could only be achieved if each partner passed on \u00a31.5m of their total assets at death sequentially, rather than in one \u00a33m estate upon the death of the second partner.",
      "The ability of estates to push up the threshold to \u00a33m will also depend on individual circumstances. Of course, not every farmer is married, and some might not be passing on a main residence.",
      "However, it\u2019s legitimate to assume that many farming estates would be able to use these allowances, which are used by the rest of the population.",
      "Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that a farming estate can be affected by this inheritance tax change, without the estate necessarily ending up paying more money in tax, because of the need for individuals to spend more time planning their tax arrangements than they did before.",

      "Prescott had been a Labour MP since 1970 - and had already made two failed attempts to become the party's deputy leader, when he strode on to the party conference stage in Brighton in 1993, to deliver the speech of his life.",
      "Labour's then-leader John Smith was trying to bring in controversial changes to switch to one-member-one vote for selecting parliamentary candidates, in the teeth of strong opposition from many trade unions who saw it as a dilution of their power.",
      "With Smith facing likely defeat and, with it, possibly the end of his leadership, he turned to Prescott - the lifelong trade unionist - to win over waverers.",
      "Despite a later reputation for mangling his words, Prescott's performance in the conference hall was an impassioned tour de force.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this man, our leader, put his head on the block... He has put his head there, now it is time to vote. Give us a little trust,\" he said.",
      "He never looked back. When Smith died little more than six months later, Prescott was - at the third attempt - elected deputy Labour leader, and became deputy PM in 1997.",

      "The negotiations in Japan ran way past their deadline and there were fears no deal would be struck.",
      "Climate campaigner and then-US Vice-President Al Gore said Prescott \"fought like hell\" for an agreement and was \"an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come\".",
      "He \"possessed an inherent ability to connect with people about the issues that mattered to them - a talent that others spend years studying and cultivating, but that was second nature to him,\" Gore added.",

      "Left hook",
      "Prescott himself said, if he was remembered for just one thing, it would be for his punch during the 2001 general election campaign.",
      "The campaign itself is remembered for little else, as Labour was returned to power with almost as large a Commons majority as four years earlier.",
      "Arriving for a party rally in Rhyl, Denbighshire, a pro-hunting supporter cracked an egg on Prescott's head.",
      "As the TV cameras continued to roll, the deputy PM responded with a left hook.",

      "The incident did not appear to dent either Prescott's or Labour's ratings in the polls.",
      "Two Jags to zero Jags",
      "Prescott was given the nickname \u201ctwo Jags\u201d by the press after it was revealed he used two Jaguar cars \u2013 one of them his own and the second a ministerial car.",
      "During the Labour conference in Bournemouth in 1999, his government car took him 250 yards from his hotel to the conference centre.",
      "On stage, as environment and transport secretary, he then urged motorists to cut their carbon emissions by using public transport.",
      "He later claimed he had taken the short journey by car because his wife, Pauline, did not like to have her hair blown about on the seafront.",
      "In 2021, Lord Prescott revealed he had since decided to make his \u201cown small contribution to cutting carbon emissions\u201d.",
      "\"I am now zero Jags \u2013 selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won\u2019t save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said: \u2018Great acts are made up of small deeds\u2019,\u201d he wrote in The Times.",
      "His son David told the BBC his father had given up cars for good.",
      "Devolution delayed",
      "When Prescott became deputy PM in 1997, he was also handed a very large portfolio as secretary of state for the new Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.",
      "In 2001, this was broken up, with separate departments for environment, food and rural affairs, and for transport, hived off.",
      "One of Prescott's passions was devolution for England's regions - to follow Scotland and Wales - though the elected regional assemblies he envisaged would have had fewer powers.",
      "Because of the scale of opposition to his plans, the government held a referendum on them in 2004, in the North-East region where support was thought to be strongest.",
      "The result was a bitter pill for Prescott to swallow, with 78% of the votes cast against devolution. A young Dominic Cummings was the mastermind behind the victorious No campaign, trying out tactics and messages he would later use in the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
      "Prescott's plan for elected regional assemblies was quickly shelved.",
      "Nevertheless, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown, said Prescott was the first person to give the north of England a political profile and paved the way for later devolution to metro mayors.",
      "Old flame at a TV wedding",
      "Prescott briefly appeared in hit TV comedy Gavin & Stacey in 2010.",
      "In the third series of the BBC show, Ruth Jones\u2019s character Nessa Jenkins regularly recalled fictional previous relationships with celebrities including Prescott.",
      "In the final episode, he made a cameo appearance as himself, arriving as a guest at Nessa\u2019s wedding as she prepared to marry fiance Dave Coaches.",
      "He enters the church and congratulates Dave, who replies: \u201cCheers John, nice to see you.\u201d",
      "Prescott wrote on his blog: \"I suppose I have to accept it appears I\u2019ve lost out to a better man.\u201d",
      "According to Nessa on screen, he gave her \u201cfull use of one of the Jags\u201d.",
      "Tears over Billy Elliot",
      "For many Labour supporters and activists, there was a sense that Prescott provided an antidote to the spin and slick presentation of New Labour.",
      "Often ridiculed by parliamentary sketch writers for mangling the English language, to supporters he appeared an ordinary man facing the intellectual bullying by people with a better education.",
      "His favourite film was Billy Elliot, the tale of a northern working-class boy who fights poverty and prejudice to become a leading ballet dancer.",
      "Prescott said he had seen it five times after it first came out in 2000. He also revealed it made him cry."

    "summary": "Borrowing was \u00a317.4bn last month, the second highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993.",
    "story": [
      "Government borrowing was much higher than expected in October, as debt interest payments hit a record high for the month and public sector pay rises contributed to higher spending.",
      "Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax take - stood at \u00a317.4bn last month, the second highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993.",
      "The borrowing figures are the first to be released since Chancellor Rachel Reeves' first Budget last month, which outlined higher spending and increased taxes.",
      "However, analysts said the worse-than-expected borrowing figure underlined the difficulties the chancellor faced in keeping public finances under control.",
      "The borrowing figures are the latest piece of challenging data for the government.",
      "Inflation figures released on Wednesday showed prices rising faster than expected, while last week it emerged that the economy barely grew between July and September.",
      "In addition, the chancellor has come under pressure from businesses and the farming community to reverse some of the tax increases announced in the Budget.",
      "Questions have also been raised over Reeves' CV, following claims she had embellished some of her past achievements.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which produced the figures, said government revenue had risen last month, despite the cut in National Insurance rates earlier in 2024.",
      "\"However, with spending on public services, benefits and debt interest costs all up on last year, expenditure rose faster than revenue overall,\" said Jessica Barnaby of the ONS.",
      "Interest payments on government debt hit \u00a39.1bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1997.",
      "The ONS figures also showed government spending on pay was up \u00a32.2bn from a year earlier, reflecting some of the impact of the latest public sector pay deals.",
      "When Labour came to power it announced above-inflation backdated pay increases for NHS staff and teachers, and these came into effect in October.",
      "Borrowing in the financial year to October has now reached \u00a396.6bn, the ONS said, which is \u00a31.1bn more than at the same point last year.",
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said Labour had inherited a difficult economic situation following the election, and the Budget was aimed at \"fixing the foundations and putting public finances on a sustainable footing\".",
      "\"This government will never play fast and loose with the public finances. Our new robust fiscal rules will deliver stability by getting debt down while prioritising investment to deliver growth.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the scale of borrowing last month was \"a direct result of Labour\u2019s decision to hand out inflation busting pay rises to their union paymasters without any reforms in return\".",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Faisal Islam: The cost-of-living crisis isn't over",
      "UK economy barely grows with Budget fears blamed",
      "Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, said October's \"disappointing\" borrowing figures demonstrated \"the fiscal challenge that the chancellor still faces\", with Reeves having \"little wiggle room\".",
      "\"While the chancellor has downplayed the chances of further tax-raising measures, if she wants to increase day-to-day spending in future years, she may need to raise taxes to pay for it,\" he said, referring to the chancellor's self-imposed targets.",
      "Last month's Budget is set to increase government spending by almost \u00a370bn a year over the next five years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, with half funded through higher taxes and the rest coming through higher borrowing.",
      "The ONS said that net debt - the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years - had reached \u00a32.8 trillion.",
      "This amount is 97.5% of the size of the UK's economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s.",
      "At the Budget, Reeves changed the government's public finance rules, which will see it track a wider measure of debt to give it more scope to borrow for investment.",
      "This new measure of debt - public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) -  was at  83.7% of GDP in October, the ONS said.",
      "The government is aiming to have this measure of debt falling as a share of the economy by the 2029-30 financial year.",

      "One was a teenage Sex Pistol who fought the establishment, and the other was an MP and former government minister.",
      "But Glen Matlock and Kevin Brennan bridged the gap from punk to politics by forging an unlikely partnership to protect music venues.",
      "They were part of the campaign which led to a law to safeguard venues under threat from developers.",

      "His solo tour includes two shows in Wales, and follows a reunion with fellow Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones - although not John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, after the famously tempestuous band fell out once again.",
      "The reformed Pistols' shows raised money to help save Cook's local venue in London which was facing closure.",
      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",
      "In the late 1970s the Pistols, as the figureheads of the punk movement, were seen by many as public enemy number one, with their assaults on the music industry, the monarchy - and pretty much everything else.",
      "Now their bassist and main songwriter is focused on ensuring today's bands still have somewhere to play.",
      "\"I was involved with The Musicians' Union,\" he said. \"There was a photocall outside Parliament about the Agent of Change Act, calling for action to protect music venues.",
      "\"Situations like where there's a club and someone builds a block of flats next to it. Then people moan about the noise, when the venue was there first.",
      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",
      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

    "story": [
      "The NHS in England came within \u201csix or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said.",
      "The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems.",
      "He stated there was never a \u201cnational shortage\u201d of PPE for healthcare workers but \u201cin some places, they did run out - and it was awful\u201d.",
      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",
      "On Thursday, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives.",
      "'Left to die'",
      "Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid.",
      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",
      "He said he felt it was his job to \u201cshield\u201d the health service from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d.",
      "Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added."

      "\"This morning we had City economists, real economists, saying that next year inflation would hit 3%.\"",
      "Rayner, who was deputising for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer while he travels back from the G20 summit in Brazil, hit back: \"Many people might not know, but [Burghart] was the minister for growth when, under Liz Truss, inflation was 11.1% and growth flatlined, so we're doing much better than he did.\"",
      "However, Burghart said it was the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic that drove up inflation under the Conservatives.",
      "He added: \"This government is doing it to the British people. High tax, high inflation, low growth, low reform, there's a word for that, it's Starmerism.\"",
      "Since winning power, Labour has agreed above-inflation pay deals for workers including doctors and train drivers in an attempt to end long-running strikes.",

      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans, said this would contribute to higher inflation in the short-term, although it would also help to drive economic growth.",
      "Businesses have also warned they will have to increase prices for customers to cover the cost of tax rises announced in the Budget.",
      "Defending the government\u2019s economic strategy, Rayner said they had taken the \"difficult decisions to fix the \u00a322bn black hole\" she claimed had been left behind by the Conservatives, while also \"investing in the future\".",
      "Rayner was also challenged over changes to inheritance tax for farming businesses, which prompted thousands of people to protest in London on Tuesday.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "Burghart called on Rayner to commit to no further increases to inheritance tax or reductions to agricultural property relief during the current Parliament.",
      "The deputy PM did not answer directly but reiterated the government's position that the \"vast majority of estate owners will be totally unaffected\" by the change."

      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:23:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Keir Starmer says it is his personal mission to defeat the people-smuggling gangs",
    "story": [
      "On a spring day, Hamid Khoshsiar decided to make the perilous journey into the European Union. He was 31 at the time, an Iranian refugee who had been living in Turkey for two years. But in 2019, he felt it was time to go.",
      "Starting out in Igneada, in the north of the country, he walked along a slippery, uneven trail for half a day, through dense forest and sharp shrubbery in the direction of Bulgaria. Eventually he reached the border.",
      "His best option, he decided, was to swim across a small river. The waters were mercifully calm. Packing his scant belongings into plastic bags, he waded in.",
      "\u201cThere was so much adrenaline in my blood,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe only thing that was important to me was safety. All my mind was about that: am I going to find safety or not?\u201d",
      "It would take him 20 hours to reach safety in Bulgaria, where he now lives with refugee status. As for the journey, he says he could have died from dehydration had he not been found by a police patrol. Still, it was the best decision of his life.",
      "\u201cIt was worth it because I didn\u2019t have any other option. I was so lucky.\u201d",
      "Over the past five years, more and more migrants have decided to try their luck following the same path, known as the Eastern Mediterranean route. It starts in Turkey and moves into either Bulgaria or Greece; and then, for many, deeper in Europe.",
      "Whilst other routes - like the path from the north African coast to Italy - have seen a fall, the numbers entering Europe via this Eastern Mediterranean route tripled between 2021 and 2023 and is still rising, according to EU border agency Frontex.",
      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",
      "Since taking power, the Labour government has repeatedly promised to \u201csmash\u201d the smuggling gangs who lead them here.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",
      "So what makes Labour think it will fare differently, and that its police-first strategy will work?",
      "The Today Podcast",
      "Special report: Europe\u2019s frontline against illegal migration",
      "Can you smash the gangs to stop the boats?",
      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",
      "For years, smugglers have used Facebook and other platforms to advertise safe passage between countries, often including prices and package deals such as \u201ckids go free\u201d.",
      "Over a traditional Syrian meat-and-rice dish of maqluba, Ali, a former footballer from Damascus, gets out his phone and shows us social media videos that promote smuggling routes. They are slick and professional, with pictures of boats and people looking joyous as they arrive in Greece.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m thinking about leaving,\u201d Ali admits. \u201cNot just me, all my friends.\u201d",
      "Britain is one of the destinations he has in mind, along with the Netherlands and Germany.",
      "Stemming the flow from Turkey",
      "The exodus from Turkey is not surprising, says Marc Pierini, EU ambassador to Turkey between 2006 and 2011. \u201cSyrian refugees in Turkey have over the past few years become the scapegoat\u2026 A whole xenophobic narrative has been [created] by the authorities.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "summary": "How future talks will play out if another superpower comes to the fore, just as the US steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool which has been trained to tell the difference between grey and red squirrels could be \"an absolute game changer\", conservationists say.",
      "The system, called Squirrel Agent, has been trained on thousands of images of the animals allowing it to tell them apart with 97% accuracy, its developer says.",
      "It can then be used to automatically control access to squirrel feeders - with only reds being allowed into those containing food, and only greys into those where food has been replaced with contraceptive paste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real showcase of what AI can do,\u201d said Emma McClenaghan, co-founder of Genysys Engine, which developed the tool.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working in real time to do a task that we don\u2019t have enough [human] volunteers to do.\u201d",
      "Squirrel Agent is currently being tested in sites around the UK in conjunction with five wildlife charities.",
      "Genysys Engine hopes it will eventually be used much more widely not just with squirrels but with other species which would benefit from sophisticated digital monitoring.",
      "Ian Glendinning, from Northern Red Squirrels - one of the conservation groups involved in the trial - told the BBC that, for the animals he is trying to protect, help from technology was urgently needed.",
      "\u201cWe are in the bar of the last chance saloon, and the landlord has just called last orders,\" he said.",
      "Red peril",
      "Grey squirrels are largely responsible for the huge decline in the numbers of red squirrels.",
      "This is partly because there are so many of them, and also because they can carry a  virus which they have immunity to but is lethal to red squirrels. They arrived in the UK around 200 years ago.",
      "\u201cRed squirrels are hanging on in Scotland and Ireland, and there are some island populations like Anglesey and the Isle of Wight\", explained Mr Glendinning.",
      "\"But mainland England and Wales is in dire straits, and they will become extinct if we are unable to reverse this trend.\"",
      "Efforts to preserve red squirrels are further complicated by the fact that, despite their name, not all red squirrels are red.",
      "There are other markers including their tails, ears, size and weight which can also distinguish them from grey squirrels \u2013 the vastly dominant population - even if they are the same colour.",
      "The detection process is time-consuming for human observers - but Squirrel Agent uses the power of AI to rapidly analyse all those markers and decide with an extremely high level of accuracy which is which.",
      "It can then automatically decide whether to boost their survival chances by allowing them extra food - or reduce their likelihood of reproducing by steering them towards contraceptives.",
      "By a whisker",
      "Genysys Engine says the next step in the evolution of the tech is to go beyond just distinguishing between the types of squirrel and instead identify individual animals.",
      "This will be done, Emma McClenaghan says, by focusing on their whiskers, which are unique to each animal.",
      "\"Whiskers are like a human fingerprints,\" she says.",
      "By distinguishing between each creature\u2019s whisker tips, as well as their base and length, she hopes AI will enable wildlife experts to track and monitor individual members of the population.",
      "\u201cOver time this data will build up, allowing scientists and researchers to start tracking family lines,\u201d she says.",
      "There are already other examples of AI's ability to process huge amounts of data very quickly being useful for conservationists.",
      "For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) used the tech to analyse millions of photographs of a large area of Australia wiped out by bushfires, in order to find places where animals had survived.",

    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",

      "\u201cThe protracted end game at COP29 is reflective of the harder geopolitical terrain the world finds itself in. The result is a flawed compromise between donor countries and the most vulnerable nations in the world,\u201d said Li Shuo from the think-tank Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stressed that the new pledge did not commit the UK to come up with more climate finance but it was actually a \u201chuge opportunity for British businesses\u201d to invest in other markets.",
      "\u201cIt is not everything we or others wanted but it is a step forward for us all,\u201d he said.",
      "In return for promising more money, developed nations including the UK and the European Union wanted stronger commitments by countries to reduce use of fossil fuels.",
      "Despite their hopes that the agreement struck at the talks in Dubai last year to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d would be strengthened, the final proposed agreement only repeated it.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:13:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Fraught debate revealed the divide between rich and poor as the UN conference sealed a climate finance deal.",
    "story": [
      "COP29 is over, with developing countries complaining that the $300bn (about \u00a3240bn) a year in climate finance they will receive by 2035 is a \"paltry sum\".",
      "Many of the rich country voices at the UN's climate conference were amazed that developing nations were unhappy with what on the surface seems a huge settlement. It is an improvement - on the current contribution of $100bn (\u00a379.8bn) a year.",
      "However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.",
      "A massive deal, but bitter divisions remain",
      "There were complaints it simply was not enough and that it was a mixture of grants and loans. And countries were deeply annoyed by the way the wealthy waited until the last minute to reveal their hand.",
      "\u201cIt's a paltry sum,\" India's delegate Chandni Raina told other delegates, after the deal had been gavelled through.",
      "\"This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.\"",
      "Ultimately, the developing world was compelled to accept it, with many rich countries pointing to next year's arrival of President Donald Trump, a known climate sceptic, and arguing that they would not get a better deal.",
      "But this package is also being criticised as short-sighted from the richer world\u2019s perspective.",
      "The argument runs that if you want to keep the world safe from rising temperatures, then wealthier nations need to help emerging economies cut their emissions, because that is where 75% of the growth in emissions has occurred in the past decade.",
      "New national plans are due to be published next spring to outline how every country will limit their planet warming gases over the next 10 years.",
      "A more generous cash settlement at COP29 would undoubtedly have had a positive knock-on effect on those efforts.",
      "And at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and distraction, keeping countries united on climate should be critical. The big fight over money re-opened old divisions between rich and poor, with an anger and bitterness I have not seen in years.",
      "COP itself is on the ropes",
      "Shepherding 200 countries to an intricate deal on climate finance was always going to be a tough task. But for hosts Azerbaijan, a country with no real history of involvement in the COP process, it proved to be almost beyond them.",
      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",
      "Azerbaijan, like the UAE, has an economy which is built on oil and gas exports, which seems at odds with a process that is meant to be helping the world transition away from coal, oil and gas.",
      "Privately, many senior negotiators spoke of their frustration with what some termed the worst COP in a decade. Half-way through the meeting, several senior climate leaders wrote a public letter saying COP was not fit for purpose and calling for reform.",
      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",
      "The natural successor is China.",
      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",
      "All in all, a move that is being seen as very deft and effective.",
      "\u201cChina is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,\u201d said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThis should propel the country to play a larger role in the future.\"",
      "'Trump-proofing' the climate",
      "Although he was not there, Trump\u2019s presence was felt across COP.",
      "One common element among the negotiators in Baku was the need to ensure that a second Trump administration would not upend years of careful climate negotiations.",
      "So it was no surprise to see that richer nations wanted to commit to raising funding by 2035. They believe putting that date will allow the US to contribute again once Trump has left office.",
      "Similarly, the drive to increase the contributor base was done with Trump in mind.",
      "Bringing China to the table, even in a voluntary capacity, will be used to show that it is worth engaging in international forums like COP.",
      "\"No-one thinks Trump in the White House will be anything but damaging to the multilateral climate regime,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, visiting senior fellow at the think tank ODI Global.",
      "\"But this agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Campaigners become more vocal",
      "One very noticeable trend at COP29 was the sometimes more aggressive stance taken by many environmental NGOs and campaigners.",
      "I witnessed it myself when US climate envoy John Podesta was chased out a meeting area with chants of \u201cshame\u201d ringing in his ears.",
      "Many developing countries rely on these NGOs for support in dealing with complex events like COP.",
      "During the talks, there was a strong push from many of these campaigners for an outright rejection of almost any deal.",
      "Similarly, in the final plenary when all countries accepted the finance text, there were brash cheers when speakers from several nations spoke out against the agreement, after the gavelling.",
      "Will confrontational activism and fraught debate become the new norm at a diplomatic climate conference?",
      "We will have to wait for the next COP to see.",
      "Climate deal too little too late, poorer nations say",
      "Standing ovation as long awaited COP29 finance deal agreed",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?"

      "At the epicentre of this devastating family drama is Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a diminutive 72-year-old woman, drugged by her former husband and abused for a decade by dozens of strangers he had recruited online.",
      "Watching her entering the court in Avignon and giving evidence, it was staggering to imagine the amount of abuse her body sustained.",
      "But as other members of her family have taken the stand, it has become painfully clear that no-one has emerged unscathed from the storm unleashed by the actions of the Pelicot patriarch.",
      "The damage to this family is clear. Individually, they have described the destructive force that engulfed them in November 2020 as a \u201ctsunami\u201d that left nothing but ruin in its wake.",

      "Warning: This story contains details some readers may find disturbing",
      "For years, he had been drugging his wife and recruiting men online to rape her while  she was unconscious.",
      "He filmed the abuse and neatly classified each visit in folders on his hard drive. Faced with the evidence, Dominique Pelicot admitted the rape charges against him.",
      "Alongside obscene language describing his videos, he added captions with the men\u2019s names. Fifty other men have been on trial with him and only a handful admit rape. More than 20 others could not be identified and are still at large.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has attended almost all of this trial. She waived her anonymity and allowed the public to see what she had endured.",
      "The videos leave no doubt that the sex acts were not consensual. Ms Pelicot can be seen lying on the bed, snoring, as her husband whispers instructions to various men to touch her, prod her, use her.",
      "Artificial sleep affords her mind a degree of protection, but her body becomes an object.",
      "She was, in her own words, treated \u201clike a rag doll, like a garbage bag\u201c.",

      "'You will die lying'",
      "The magnitude of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s betrayal and crimes is such that the aftershocks have rippled far beyond his ex-wife.",
      "The Pelicots\u2019 middle child, Caroline Darian, now 45, screamed her anguish at her father in court as she demanded to know the truth about photos found on his computer. Entitled \u201cMy naked daughter\u201d, the images show her semi-naked and, she says, clearly drugged.",
      "Mr Pelicot has offered various and at times contradictory explanations for the pictures, although he has denied abusing his daughter. \u201cI never touched you,\u201d he pleaded with her.",
      "But his duplicity has been abundantly exposed during this trial, and he has clearly lost the right to be believed by his daughter.",
      "\u201cYou are a liar,\u201d she shouted back at him. \u201cI am sick of your lies, you are alone in your lie, you will die lying.\u201d",
      "Fighting back tears, she accused her father of looking at her \u201cwith incestuous eyes\u201d.",
      "Caroline Darian has told the court she feels she is the trial\u2019s \u201cforgotten victim\u201d as, unlike her mother\u2019s case, there is no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted on her.",
      "She has founded a charity to highlight the dangers of drug-induced assault and published a book in 2022 detailing her family\u2019s trauma. In it, she hinted at a rift with her mother, who she found had dropped off a bundle of warm clothes for her father in jail, weeks after his crimes came to light.",

Gis\u00e8le shook her head, but Caroline cracked a slight smile, appearing to acknowledge the lawyer's description.",

      "In a desperate search for answers, he wondered out loud whether he could be the \u201cmotive\u201d for his father\u2019s crimes. He said he would seek out a paternity test, adding it would be a \u201crelief\u201d not to be Dominique Pelicot\u2019s son.",
      "Through tears, Florian painted a desolate picture of what his life had become. His marriage to the mother of his three children, Aurore, has not survived revelations that Dominique Pelicot also surreptitiously took photographs of her.",
      "Despite their separation, this slight, softly-spoken woman has frequently attended the trial and said it had exposed the \u201cbanality\u201d of abuse.",
      "Aurore, herself a survivor of incest, is having to live with the regret of not having listened to her instincts regarding Mr Pelicot. \u201cIf she had, she may have been able to alter the course of events,\u201d her lawyer said.",
      "'My childhood has disappeared'",
      "The eldest of the Pelicot children, David, is a burly man of 50 who bears a striking resemblance to his father.",
      "Taking the stand this week, he described how he had grown closer to Dominique Pelicot when he had himself become a father.",
      "Then, his voice growing more anguished and clutching the stand as if to steady himself, he recalled the harrowing detail the night his mother told him of his father\u2019s arrest. \u201cAll of us know where we were when the tsunami hit,\u201d he said.",
      "Naked photographs of his wife Celine, pregnant with their twin daughters, were also found among Mr Pelicot\u2019s files. She was in the bathroom, snapped with a hidden camera.",
      "His voice heavy with emotion, David described watching his mother, frail and lost, standing on a train platform, her life reduced to her dog and a suitcase.",
      "Recalling the birthday parties his parents used to throw for him and his siblings, to the envy of their friends, he said: \u201cMy childhood has disappeared; it was erased.\u201d",
      "The trauma rippling through this family seems without end. David\u2019s son, now 18, wonders what really happened when Dominique asked him to \u201cplay doctor\u201d as a child.",
      "His young siblings, the family\u2019s lawyer said on Wednesday, \u201cwill have to find their place in a family in which their grandmother, their mother, their brother and their aunts have all been victims of their grandfather.\u201d",

      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",
      "It's not new to not include a product in an ad or to raise eyebrows - the gorilla beating the drums to Phil Collins didn't feature any Cadbury's chocolate, for example.",
      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",
      "While Jaguar isn't changing its name, Mr Wells says the brand has taken a \"huge, bold step\" and people should give \"respect and time\" to see how things pan out.",
      "Mr Rolston said \"branding logic\" suggests companies \"lean into\" their current perception with the public, but Jaguar appears to have shunned that.",
      "\"Everything they have put out so far is not like a Jaguar. The question is, if it\u2019s not a Jaguar as you used to know it, what is it?\"",
      "Jaguar argues its rebrand can been traced back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons, that \"A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing\".",
      "'Something has to change'",
      "But it's clear, as Erin Baker, editorial director at AutoTrader puts it, that the carmaker is trying to ditch the \"sage\" image, that its cars are only for older, white men, who perhaps frequent golf clubs, or wear cravats and smoke cigars.",
      "\"It\u2019s been languishing in terms of sales for years now,\" she said. \"Something has to change fundamentally with the brand.\"",
      "But Ms Baker is a fan of the rebrand ad. \"I think it needs to really stir emotion, it needs to stir curiosity, get people asking questions,\" she says.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade, with The Range Rover and Defender behind the company's highest profits.",
      "Ms Baker believes Jaguar's radical rebrand is a final attempt to revive it. But what happens if it doesn't pay off?",
      "\"I am not sure what else they can do,\" adds Ms Baker. \"It\u2019s a very risky move to go pure electric in 2026 when sales of electric cars the world over have largely stalled amongst private buyers.",
      "\"But the truth is...no one has an idea if this is going to succeed or not.\"",

      "It is electronisation of our societies that is primarily behind the e-waste rise \u2014 ranging from smartphones, computers and smart alarms, to automobiles with electronic devices installed, whose demand is steadily on the rise.",
      "Annual smartphone shipments, for instance, have more than doubled since 2010, hitting 1.2 billion in 2023, according to a UN Trade and Development report this year.",
      "Most frequently seized item",
      "The UN says only around 15% of the world\u2019s e-waste is recycled, so unscrupulous companies are seeking to offload it elsewhere, often through middle men who then traffick the waste out of the country.",
      "Such waste is difficult to recycle because of their complex composition including toxic chemicals, metals, plastics and elements that cannot be easily separated and recycled.",
      "Even developed countries do not have adequate e-waste management infrastructure.",
      "UN investigators say they are seeing a significant rise in the trafficking of e-waste from developed countries and rapidly emerging economies. E-waste is now the most frequently seized item, accounting for one in six of all types of waste seizures globally, the World Customs Organisation has found.",
      "Officials at Italy\u2019s Naples port showed the BBC World Service how traffickers mis-declared and hid e-waste, which they said made up around 30% of their seizures.",
      "They showed a scan of a container bound for Africa, carrying a car. But when port officials opened the container, broken parts of vehicles and e-waste were stacked inside, with oil leaking from some of them.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t pack your personal goods like this, much of it is meant for dumping,\u201d says Luigi Garruto, an investigator with the European Anti-Fraud Office (Olaf), who collaborates with port officials across Europe.",

      "In the UK, officials say they are also seeing a rise in trafficked e-waste.",
      "At the Port of Felixstowe, Ben Ryder, a spokesman for the UK Environment Agency, said waste items were often wrongly declared as reusable but in reality, \u201cbroken down for precious metals and then illegally burnt after they reach the destination\u201d in countries like Ghana.",
      "Traffickers also attempt to conceal e-waste by grinding it down and blending it with other forms of plastic that can be exported with the correct paperwork, he said.",
      "A previous report by the World Customs Organization showed there had been an increase of almost 700% in trafficking of end-of-life motor vehicles - a huge source of e-waste.",
      "But experts say such seizures and reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg.",
      "Although there has been no comprehensive global study that traces all the e-waste trafficked out of the developed world, the UN e-waste report shows countries in Southeast Asia still remain a major destination.",
      "But with some of those countries now clamping down on waste trafficking, UN investigators and campaigners say more e-waste is making its way to African countries.",
      "In Malaysia, officials seized 106 containers of hazardous e-waste from May to June 2024, according to Masood Karimipour, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific.",
      "But traffickers often outsmart authorities with new smuggling tactics and governments don\u2019t catch up fast enough, UN investigators say.",
      "\u201cWhen ships carrying hazardous waste like e-waste cannot easily offload them in their usual destination, they turn their beacon off when they are in the middle of the sea so that they cannot be detected,\u201d said Mr. Karimapour.",
      "\u201cAnd the illegal shipment is dumped at sea as part of a business model of organised crime activity.",
      "\u201cThere are far too many groups and far too many countries profiting from this global criminal enterprise.\u201d",
      "Chemicals of high concern",
      "When e-waste is burnt or dumped, the plastic and metals it contains can be very hazardous to human health and have negative effects on the environment, a recent report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.",
      "The WHO says many recipient countries also see informal e-waste recycling - meaning untrained people including women and children are doing the job without protective equipment and the right infrastructure, and are being exposed to toxic substances like lead.",
      "The International Labour Organisation and WHO estimate that millions of women and child labourers working in the informal recycling sector may be affected.",
      "The organisations also say exposure during foetal development and in children can cause neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural related disorders.",
      "From January 2025, global waste treaty the Basel Convention will require exporters to declare all e-waste and obtain permission from recipient countries. Investigators are hopeful that this will close some of the loopholes that traffickers have been using to ship such waste across the world.",
      "But there are some countries including the US \u2014 a major e-waste exporter \u2014 that have not ratified the Basel Convention - one reason campaigners say e-waste trafficking continues.",

      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",

      "A massive Israeli air strike on central Beirut has killed at least 20 people, Lebanese officials say, in the latest attack on the capital amid an escalation of Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah.",
      "The strike happened without warning at about 04:00 (02:00 GMT) on Saturday, and was an attempt to assassinate a senior Hezbollah official, Israeli media reported.",
      "The attack was heard and felt across the city, and destroyed at least one eight-storey residential building in the densely populated Basta district.",

      "The death toll rose from 15 to 20 on Saturday as emergency workers used heavy machinery to remove the rubble and retrieve bodies.",
      "The Lebanese health ministry said more than 60 people had been wounded, and that the number of victims was expected to rise as DNA tests would be carried out on body parts that had been recovered.",
      "\u201cIt was a very horrible explosion. All the windows and glasses were over me, my wife and my children. My home now is a battlefield,\u201d said 55-year-old Ali Nassar, who lived in a nearby building.",

      "According to the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, the attack was an attempt to kill Mohammed Haydar, a top Hezbollah official. Hezbollah MP Amin Sherri said none of the group\u2019s leaders were in the building hit, and Haydar\u2019s fate remained unclear.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not commented.",
      "Also on Saturday, the IDF carried out further air strikes on the Dahieh, the area in southern Beirut where Hezbollah is based, saying they were buildings linked to the group.",

      "In the past two weeks, Israel has intensified its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia and political movement, amid international efforts for a ceasefire, in what appears to be a strategy to pressure the group to accept a deal.",
      "The escalation comes as renewed negotiations to end more than one year of conflict showed initial signs of progress. This week, Amos Hochstein, who has led the Biden administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts, held talks in Lebanon and Israel to try to advance a US-drafted deal.",
      "Since the conflict intensified in late September, Lebanese authorities have said any deal should be limited to the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel.",
      "The resolution includes the withdrawal of Hezbollah\u2019s fighters and weapons in areas between the Blue Line - the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the boundary with Israel.",
      "Israel says that was never fully respected, while Lebanon says Israeli violations included military flights over Lebanese territory.",
      "The proposal, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, includes a 60-day ceasefire which would see the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the removal of Hezbollah\u2019s presence from the area. The Lebanese military would then boost its presence there, with thousands of extra troops.",
      "But disagreements over some elements remained, the diplomat added, including about the timeline for an Israeli pull-out and the formation of an international mechanism to monitor the agreement.",
      "Both Hezbollah and Iran have indicated being interested in a deal, according to a senior Lebanese source. After the initial shock, the group has reorganised itself, and continues to carry out daily attacks on Israel, though not with the same intensity, and confront invading Israeli soldiers.",
      "On Wednesday, Hezbollah\u2019s Secretary General Naim Qassem said the group had received the US proposal, clarified its reservations, and that it was allowing the talks to go ahead to see if they produced any results. The conditions for a deal, he said, were a complete cessation of hostilities and the preservation of Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty, warning that Hezbollah was ready for a long fight.",

    "story": [
      "The mourners at a cemetery in crisis-hit Mozambique's capital, Maputo, were strikingly young - children shedding tears as they bade farewell to a 16-year-old friend, who was shot dead while banging pots and pans in an opposition-organised protest against the outcome of last month's presidential election.",
      "\"Antonio was shot in the mouth, and the bullet went through the back of his head,\" his uncle, Manuel Samuel, told the BBC.",
      "\"We saw CCTV footage from nearby shops of police shooting at protesters,\" he added.",
      "Antonio Juaqim's killing is a tragic reminder of the volatile political climate in the southern African state since Frelimo - the former liberation movement in power since independence 49 years ago - was declared the winner of the poll.",
      "The electoral commission said Frelimo's presidential candidate, Daniel Chapo, won with a whopping 71% of the vote, compared to the 20% of his closest rival, Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane.",
      "An evangelical pastor who contested the presidency as an independent after breaking away from the main opposition Renamo party, Mondlane rejected the declaration, alleging the poll was rigged.",
      "This was denied by the electoral commission, but Mondlane - who fled the country, fearing arrest - has rallied his supporters via social media to protest against the result.",
      "Every night at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT), people have been banging pots and pans in their homes, as they heed Mondlane's call to send a loud message that they reject an extension of Frelimo's 49-year rule.",
      "Mr Samuel said the protest was first held on the night of 15 November when huge numbers of people took to the streets to bang pots, pans and bottles or to blow whistles.",
      "\"It was as though a new Mozambique was being born,\" he added.",
      "But the night ended tragically, with Antonio being among those killed by police, Mr Samuel said.",
      "Since then most people have been carrying out the protest inside their homes, with the sound of banged pots and pans echoing across Maputo at 21:00 every night.",
      "At Antonio's funeral at the S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier Cemetery four days after his killing, one of his friends delivered his mother\u2019s eulogy: \"You were so full of life and hope. Now you are a victim of a bullet.\"",

      "Campaign group Human Rights Watch said that about 40 people - including at least 10 children - have been killed by police during the post-election protests.",
      "Mozambique\u2019s police commander Bernadino Raphael expressed sympathy with the families of the victims, but deflected responsibility for the deaths, blaming Mondlane's supporters.",
      "\"They are using children as shields in front of them while they remain behind,\" he alleged in a BBC interview.",
      "The commander added that in many instances police had no choice but to defend themselves from protesters who had unleashed violence, including killing six officers and looting and burning property and vehicles.",
      "\"We recorded 103 injured people, 69 of whom were police officers,\" he said.",
      "But Albino Forquilha, the leader of the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique, which backed Mondlane\u2019s presidential bid, accused police of using excessive force to suppress dissent.",
      "\"It feels as though they are being used to protect the ruling party,\" he told the BBC.",
      "South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies analyst Borges Nhamirre said this was the first time Mozambique had witnessed so many casualties, and damage to property, during protests.",
      "He said it was clear that Frelimo had lost popularity, especially among young people who were \"looking for jobs, looking for vocational training, looking for a plot to build their house, looking for some money\".",
      "\"They don't care about who brought independence. The independence they want is their financial independence,\" Mr Nhamirre said.",
      "After the result was announced on 24 October, Chapo was adamant that he and Frelimo had won in a free and fair contest, saying: \"We are an organised party that prepares its victories.\"",
      "Since then he has kept a notably low profile, waiting for the courts to rule on Mondlane's bid to annul the result.",
      "In an apparent attempt to keep up the pressure ahead of the ruling, many of Mondlane's supporters also heeded his call to mourn the dead for three days (until 22 November) by stopping their vehicles and hooting at noon.",
      "Like Antonio, 20-year-old Alito Momad was allegedly killed by police during the protests.",
      "The BBC came across some of his friends in a neighbourhood outside Maputo, holding a night vigil for him on 17 November.",
      "With a Mozambican flag laid out on the floor next to burning candles, Alito's friends showed us a photo of him - with what appeared to be a gunshot wound in the back of his head.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces arrest if he travels to the UK, after an international arrest warrant was issued for him, Downing Street has indicated.",
      "A No 10 spokesman refused to comment on the specific case but said the government would fulfil its \"legal obligations\".",

      "The court's member countries, including the UK, have signed a treaty that obliges them to act on arrest warrants.",

    "story": [
      "Medics at the epicentre of the mpox outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have told the BBC there has been a notable reduction in new infections since the first batch of vaccines were rolled out last month.",
      "The UN World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed to the BBC that new cases appeared to be \"plateauing\" in DR Congo, but cautioned that it was too early to tell the impact of vaccinations.",
      "Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - is a highly contagious disease and is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo this year.",
      "WHO officials confirmed mpox remains a global public health emergency, the highest alert for any major outbreak.",
      "Other public health experts in Africa have warned the disease is still spreading, with 19 countries in the continent reporting infections.",
      "What is mpox and how is it spread?Nurses working in fear: BBC visits mpox epicentre",
      "What is mpox and how is it spread?",
      "Nurses working in fear: BBC visits mpox epicentre",
      "In September the BBC visited a clinic in Lwiro, a rural area about an hour's drive outside the city of Bukavu in DR Congo's eastern province of South Kivu.",
      "The cases there have been linked to a relatively new and more severe strain of mpox known as Clade 1b, which appears to spread more easily and cause more serious disease.",
      "Two months ago, we found the community hospital overwhelmed - with long queues of infected patients, many forced to share beds or mattresses on the floor and doctors struggling to cope with the numbers arriving each day.",
      "\"Right now, we can't have more than 60 patients in the hospital,\" nurse Emmanuel Fikiri, who has been on the front line of the mpox crisis for months, told the BBC this week.",
      "\"This is due to the fact that there has been an improvement, there has been vaccination against mpox and there has been support from several partners who have enabled us to take care of the patients,\" he said.",
      "When Mr Fikiri last spoke to the BBC he could only talk briefly as he rushed off to treat some of the nearly 200 patients who were then crammed into the wards.",
      "But he is now much more optimistic about the situation given that vaccine take up in the community has been high - meaning new infections appear to have dropped dramatically.",
      "Indeed when a BBC producer visited the Lwiro hospital earlier this week we found a much calmer scene: the long queues had gone and there were some empty beds in the children's ward.",
      "DR Congo started its mpox vaccination programme in October after taking delivery of 265,000 doses donated by the international community.",
      "More than 50,000 people have been vaccinated so far - with the rollout focused on communities most at risk, including towns and villages in the eastern DR Congo.",
      "But experts have noted that mpox appears to be disproportionately affecting children in DR Congo - and they are not being vaccinated. It was only this week that the WHO authorised a vaccine expected from Japan for children.",
      "\"Out of the people affected, about 30% are children,\" Dr Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), told the BBC - explaining that children were \"also vectors of transmission\".",
      "Another nurse at the Lwiro clinic, Jackson Murhula, warned that it was too early to say for sure the disease in the community had been beaten - though he too was happy to see things easing.",
      "\"Lately it's started to slow down, because at the beginning we were receiving 10 or 15 new cases a day, but now we're only receiving two or three cases a day,\" he said.",
      "\"We can't confirm that we've totally stabilised the disease, because cases are still coming in, but it's not like before.\"",
      "Among the children being treated this week is three-year-old Atukuzwe Banissa.",
      "He groans in pain, his eyes shut and face covered in whitish spots left behind by the healing sores.",
      "His mother, 25-year-old Julienne Mwinja, says his symptoms began with teary eyes.",
      "She administered eye drops, but within a day, the little boy developed sores in his mouth, face and body.",
      "\"He looked like he'd been scalded by hot water,\" the mother of three told the BBC.",
      "That is when she brought him to Lwiro hospital where he was admitted for more than a week.",
      "For the medics at Lwrio, it is heartening that people are now tending to come to the clinic as soon as they get symptoms rather than first going to traditional healers.",
      "Dr Samuel Boland, WHO incident manager for mpox, told the BBC that more than 96% of all new mpox cases were currently in DR Congo, Uganda and Rwanda.",
      "While confirming DR Congo had turned a corner, he warned it was too soon to be sure the outbreak was over.",
      "\"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we've actually seen, to some extent, a plateauing in the number of mpox cases, but collectively, it still is a very significantly affected country globally,\" he said.",
      "In fact, more than 90% of those who have died of mpox worldwide this year have been in DR Congo.",
      "Although exact figures are unknown as only 77 deaths have been confirmed in the laboratory as there are not many testing centres available in certain areas of the continent.",
      "\"And so there remains a very, very strong need to make sure that we continue intervening at pace and at scale, even in places where we see that there may not be an escalation of cases at this moment in time,\" Dr Boland said.",
      "\"Though overall, we might see a shift in the transmission in some places, we do again, still see escalation in others - and so we're not out of the woods yet.\"",
      "Vaccination programmes have started elsewhere in Africa too, including in Nigeria and DR Congo\u2019s neighbour Rwanda.",
      "Dr Kaseya said the Africa CDC had not seen any notable changes week-on-week over the past month in the DR Congo and warned that it was too early to say the mpox outbreak was under control.",
      "With every effort to conduct vaccinations, reinforce surveillance and laboratory systems \"maybe by mid-January to February we\u2019ll start to see a decrease in the cases of infection and deaths\".",
      "WHO Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus said there is an urgent need for a coordinated global response.",

      "They brought about 100 migrants illegally to Europe each week, over a period of two years.",
      "The pair - based in a car wash in the south Wales town of Caerphilly - offered the migrants bronze, silver, gold and platinum packages, depending on risk.",
      "A platinum package could get you a flight, whereas silver might land you a \"comfortable ride\" in the back of a lorry.",
      "Migrants from the Middle East heading to Europe rated their journeys in videos filmed inside lorries, boats and even on planes.",
      "\"How was the route, lads?\" a man asks in one clip, as someone at the back of the lorry gives a thumbs-up.",
      "Investigators found the video reviews on the phones of the smugglers themselves, seemingly made as promotional material.",
      "According to the National Crime Agency (NCA), most of the people using their services were from Iran, Iraq and Syria, searching for a better life in western Europe. Many are believed to have come to the UK.",
      "In one video, a migrant said: \"Lorry route agreement with knowledge of the driver; here we have men, women and children - thank God the route was easy and good.\"",

      "\"It's like Tripadvisor, they were rating their service within that community,\" he said.",

      "\"From last Friday till last night, I have been smuggling people,\" Shamo said in one conversation.",
      "\"A batch every single day, Kurds from Turkey... so this week, I smuggled six to seven batches.\"",
      "Profits unlikely to be recovered",
      "Mr Evans told the BBC Wales Investigates programme that they hope to have \"dismantled and disrupted\" part of the smuggling industry.",
      "But he said there was \"no doubt\" someone else would take over because it was such a \"fruitful business model\".",
      "Shamo and Khdir made hundreds of thousands if not millions of pounds, he said, but the profits were unlikely ever to be recovered.",
      "This is because they used a system known as hawala banking, which does not require detailed information from those using it.",
      "Individuals can deposit money to a hawala broker in one country, and a recipient withdraws it from a broker in another country, using a code.",
      "This means money is transferred without any cash being physically moved. No identification is needed from those using it.",
      "While there are legitimate and even \"essential\" uses for it - such as people without bank accounts sending remittances to their families abroad - it is also a system that is \"attractive for criminal activity\", said Claire Healy, of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).",
      "On the trail of the smuggling gangs",
      "We knew that from their car wash in south Wales, Shamo and Khdir had contacts in Iraq as a key part of their smuggling operation.",
      "So we travelled to the city of Erbil and enlisted the help of a local man with knowledge of smuggling gangs to find out more about the shady but hugely profitable smuggling industry.",
      "He quickly found adverts on TikTok offering a similar service to the men from Caerphilly, but they were unlikely to talk openly about illegal activity.",
      "So we went undercover, sending our contact in to pose as an Iraqi man looking to reach the UK.",
      "One smuggler said he could arrange for us to be taken from France to the UK in the back of a lorry for $5,000 (\u00a33,900).",
      "Another man, who called himself Bawar, claimed to be based in Cardiff and offered a more comfortable trip, with a fake passport.",
      "\"My brother, we have by plane from France to Britain... we guarantee no stoppage or fingerprinting,\" he told us.",
      "\"The amount is $8,000 (\u00a36,200) and you can easily deposit the amount in any transfer office you want.\"",
      "To finalise the deal, Bawar told us to deposit the money at a hawala in Erbil.",
      "When our undercover reporter arrived there, the man running it appeared familiar with the arrangement. We confirmed we were travelling by plane with documents provided by Bawar.",
      "\"OK, fine. You must know that the [hawala] fee is \u00a3400,\" he replied.",
      "We did not go through with the deal, but it appeared to illustrate how easily the hawala banking system is being exploited by smugglers.",
      "When the BBC approached Bawar for comment, he denied being involved in smuggling, claiming he was a shepherd who had no money.",
      "The hawala owner in Erbil denied offering to take money to help our undercover reporter travel to the UK on a false passport.",

      "This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.",
      "In 2024, Trump\u2019s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.",
      "But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.",
      "To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.",
      "For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate \"may be overwrought\", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to \"justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government\".",
      "His electoral college win was resounding",
      "On a different metric, Trump\u2019s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris\u2019s 226.",
      "And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.",
      "The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.",
      "Trump\u2019s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.",
      "And it is important to remember that the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.",

      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.",
      "If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.",
      "That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.",
      "In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.",
      "But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender.",

      "There is another measure with which to consider Trump\u2019s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.",
      "The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.",
      "It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent to lead the US Treasury Department, one of the most influential roles in government with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.",
      "The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.",
      "Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.",
      "The 62-year-old's nomination on Friday evening kicked-off a series of cabinet announcements and White House appointments that leaves Trump's top team almost complete ahead of his return to the presidency in January.",
      "\"Scott is widely respected as one of the World\u2019s foremost International Investors and Geopolitical and Economic Strategists,\" Trump said in his announcement on Truth Social.",
      "\"[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,\" he said, adding that Bessent would \"support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances.\"",
      "Bessent has made it well known that he wants to extend tax cuts made in Mr Trump's first term in office.",
      "He has also defended the use of import tariffs, one of the more controversial parts of the President-elect's campaign agenda, calling them a \"useful negotiating tool\".",
      "On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a \"new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes\".",
      "A Friday flurry",
      "Trump also nominated Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer for US Labor Secretary on Friday, saying she would help to \"grow wages and improve working conditions [and] bring back our manufacturing jobs\".",
      "The representative from Oregon, 56, won strong trade union support but narrowly lost her bid for re-election earlier this month, meaning her nomination will not affect the Republican majority in the House come January.",
      "He then made another cabinet nomination moments later, announcing Scott Turner as his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The NFL veteran and motivational speaker previously served in the Texas House of Representatives.",
      "Trump also announced a series of senior health picks, giving his backing to Fox News contributor Dr Janette Nesheiwat as Surgeon General and former Florida Congressman Dr Dave Weldon as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "He selected Russell Vought as director of the US Office of Management and Budget, which helps decide policy priorities and how they should be funded.",
      "Vought, who played a role in Project 2025 - a \"wish list\" for a second Trump presidency by the conservative Heritage Foundation - held the same position during Trump's first term.",
      "The president-elect also announced White House roles for Alex Wong and Sebastian Gorka who also served during Trump's first term.",
      "How will Bessent lead US Treasury?",
      "If his nomination to lead the Treasury department is confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would almost immediately be plunged into the fight in Washington over extending the tax cuts from Trump's first term.",
      "Trump has also called for controversial changes to trade policy, proposing sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Such ideas have been met with alarm in traditional economic and corporate circles.",
      "In an interview with Fox News shortly before the election, Bessent said ensuring the tax cuts do not expire as planned at the end of next year would be his top priority, if he ended up in the administration.",
      "\"If it doesn\u2019t happen, this will be the largest tax increase in US history,\" he warned.",
      "For other posts, Trump has been willing to back candidates with minimal experience in favour of loyalty and apparent conviction in his pledges.",
      "But he has appeared more hesitant to buck convention at the Treasury Department, which serves as a key liaison between the White House and Wall Street and has critical functions that include collecting taxes, supervising banks, wielding sanctions and handling US government debt.",
      "In his announcement, Trump said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt\u201d. That issue has long been a priority for traditional Republicans, but financial markets see an increase in debt as a risk in a second Trump term.",
      "Bessent, a native of South Carolina, made his name in the 1990s betting against the British pound and Japanese yen while working for Soros, a major Democratic donor.",
      "In 2015, he started his own fund, Key Square Capital Management, which is known for making investments based on big-picture economic policy.",
      "He and his husband, a former New York City prosecutor, married in 2011 and have two children. He is known for philanthropy in South Carolina, where his family has deep roots.",
      "Bessent has defended tariffs - a capstone of Trump's protectionist agenda - arguing that opposition to them is rooted in political ideology and not \"considered economic thought\".",
      "But he has also characterised Trump\u2019s support for such border taxes as a negotiating tool, suggesting the president-elect isn\u2019t necessarily committed to aggressively raising duties.",
      "That stance makes him more moderate than others whose names were floated for the treasury role.",
      "However, Bessent has been a strong proponent of Trump\u2019s embrace of the crypto industry. Such support would make him the first treasury secretary to openly champion cryptocurrency, sending a clear signal that Trump is serious about establishing the US as the \"crypto capital of the planet\".",

      "His departure cast doubt on whether the report would see the light of day, because having resigned he is no longer under congressional jurisdiction and the committee only investigates House members.",
      "The committee Chairman Michael Guest, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that he had \"some reservations\" about releasing the report because it is still going through the review process.",
      "He told CNN the committee would consider releasing it publicly or sending it directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but it remains uncertain whether it will leave the committee at all.",

      "Two women testified to the committee that Gaetz paid them \"for sex\", their lawyer, Joel Leppard, told CBS this week. One of the women also testified that she witnessed the then-congressman having sex with a minor during a party in 2017, the lawyer said.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 01:34:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Forty years on, the Band Aid song continues to generate debate about the way it presents Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",
      "He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.",
      "\"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn\u2019t,\" he told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa podcast this week.",
      "\"It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. It\u2019s still saying there\u2019s death in every tear,\" he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.",
      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

    "title": "India's 'rebel' Muslim princess who shot tigers and drove a Rolls-Royce",
    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 01:27:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Abida Sultaan defied stereotypes around women in general and Muslim women in particular.",
    "story": [
      "Abida Sultaan was nothing like your typical princess.",
      "She wore her hair short, shot tigers and was an ace polo player. She flew planes and drove herself around in a Rolls-Royce from the age of nine.",
      "Born in 1913 into a family of brave 'begums' (a Muslim woman of high rank) who ruled the northern princely state of Bhopal in British India for over a century, Abida continued their legacy of defying stereotypes around women in general and Muslim women in particular.",
      "She refused to be in purdah - a practice followed by Muslim, and some Hindu women, of wearing clothes that conceal them and secluding themselves from men - and became heir to the throne at the age of 15.",
      "Abida ran her father's cabinet for more than a decade, rubbed shoulders with India's prominent freedom fighters and would eventually come to have a ringside view of the hate and violence the country disintegrated into after it was partitioned in 1947 to create Pakistan.",
      "She was groomed from a young age to take on the mantle of ruler under the guidance of her grandmother, Sultan Jehan, a strict disciplinarian who was the ruler of Bhopal.",
      "In her 2004 autobiography, Memoirs of a Rebel Princess, Abida writes about how she had to wake up at four in the morning to read the Quran - the religious text of Islam - and then proceed with a day filled with activities, which included learning sports, music and horse riding, but also included chores like sweeping the floor and cleaning bathrooms.",
      "\"We girls were not allowed to feel any inferiority on account of our sex. Everything was equal. We had all the freedom that a boy had; we could ride, climb trees, play any game we chose to. There were no restrictions,\" she said in an interview about her childhood.",
      "Abida had a fierce, independent streak even as a child and rebelled against her grandmother when she forced her into purdah at the age of 13. Her chutzpah coupled with her father's broad-mindedness helped her escape the practice for the rest of her life.",
      "Already heir to the throne of Bhopal, Abida stood the chance of becoming part of the royal family of the neighbouring princely state of Kurwai as well when at the age of 12, she was married off to Sarwar Ali Khan, her childhood friend and ruler Kurwai. She described her nikah (wedding), about which she was clueless, in hilarious detail in her memoir.",
      "She writes about how one day, while she was pillow-fighting with her cousins, her grandmother walked into the room and asked her to dress up for a wedding. Only, no one told her that she was the bride.",
      "\"No-one had prepared or instructed me on how to conduct myself, with the result that I walked into the nikah chamber, pushing the gathered women out of my way, my face uncovered, sulking as usual for being chosen again for some new  experiment,\" she writes.",
      "The wedding was brief like Abida's marriage, which lasted for less than a decade.",
      "Married life was difficult for Abida, not just because of her young age but also because of her strict, pious upbringing. She candidly describes how a lack of knowledge and discomfort with sex took a toll on her marriage.",
      "\"Immediately after my wedding, I entered the world of conjugal trauma. I had not realised that the consummation that followed would leave me so horrified, numbed and feeling unchaste,\" she writes and adds that she could never bring herself to \"accept marital relations between husband and wife\". This led to the breakdown of her marriage.",
      "In her paper on intimacy and sexuality in the autobiographical writings of Muslim women in South Asia, historian Siobhan Lambert-Hurley underscores how Abida's honest reflections on sexual intimacy with her husband tear apart the stereotype that Muslim women do not write about sex, by presenting an unabashed voice on the topic.",
      "After her marriage fell apart, Abida left her marital home in Kurwai and moved back to Bhopal. But the couple's only son, Shahryar Mohammad Khan, became the subject of an ugly custody dispute. Frustrated by the drawn-out battle and not wanting to part with her son, Abida took a bold step to make her husband back off.",
      "On a warm night in March 1935, Abida drove for three hours straight to reach her husband's home in Kurwai. She entered his bedroom, pulled out a revolver, threw it in her husband's lap and said: \"Shoot me or I will shoot you.\"",
      "This incident, coupled with a physical confrontation between the couple in which Abida emerged victorious, put an end to the custody dispute. She proceeded to raise her son as a single mother while juggling her duties as heir to the throne. She ran her state's cabinet from 1935 till 1949, when Bhopal was merged with the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.",
      "Abida also attended the round-table conferences - called by the British government to decide the future government of India - during which she met influential leaders  like Mahatma Gandhi, Motilal Nehru and his son, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was to become India's first prime minister.",
      "She also experienced first-hand the deteriorating relationship between Hindus and Muslims and the violence that broke out in the aftermath of India's partition in 1947.",
      "In her memoir Abida describes the discrimination she began facing in Bhopal; how her family, who had lived there peacefully for generations, began to be treated as \"outsiders\". In one of her interviews, she spoke about a particularly disturbing memory she had of the violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "One day, after the Indian government informed her that a train carrying Muslim refugees would arrive in Bhopal, she went to the railway station to supervise the arrival.",
      "\"When the compartments were opened, they were all dead,\" she said and added that it was this violence and distrust that drove her to move to Pakistan in 1950.",
      "Abida left quietly, with only her son and hopes for a brighter future. In Pakistan, she championed democracy and women's rights through her political career. Abida died in Karachi in 2002.",
      "After she left for Pakistan, the Indian government had made her sister heir to the throne. But Abida is still known in Bhopal, where people refer to her by her nickname 'bia huzoor'.",
      "\"Religious politics over the past few years have chipped away at her legacy and she isn't spoken about as much any more,\" says journalist Shams Ur Rehman Alavi, who has been researching Bhopal's women rulers.",
      "\"But her name isn't likely to be forgotten anytime soon.\"",

    "story": [
      "For Australian friends Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, it was their first big trip venturing out to explore the world.",
      "Like so many 19-year-olds, they were drawn to the romance of backpacking across South East Asia - where food is great, people are friendly and the scenery stunning.",
      "They had \u201csaved up enough money after school and university to have their overseas jaunt, as so many of our kids do,\u201d said their football team coach Nick Heath. \u201cAnd off they went.\u201d",
      "They ended up on 12 November in the riverside town of Vang Vieng in central Laos.",
      "The two checked into the popular Nana Backpacker Hostel - where guests often receive a free shot upon arrival. Days later both were on life support in hospitals in Thailand.",
      "Jones\u2019s death was announced on 21 November, and Bowles\u2019s a day later. The death of a British woman, 28-year-old Simone White, was also announced on Thursday.",
      "They are among six foreign tourists who have died from what is believed to be a mass incident of methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng.",
      "Two Danish women, aged 19 and 20, died last week, while an American man also died. They have not been identified.",
      "It is unclear how many others have fallen ill, but a transnational police investigation is now underway into the deaths.",
      "Much of the scrutiny has fallen on the hostel where some of the victims were reportedly staying. The girls had taken free shots there before heading out for the night.",
      "The hostel manager has denied culpability, saying the same drinks had been served to at least 100 other guests that night who reported no problems. The manager was taken in by police for questioning on Thursday.",
      "Mr Heath, who spoke to media on behalf of Ms Bowles\u2019s family, said they knew it was methanol that caused the girls to fall ill. But \u201cno one really knows how and where it entered their system\u201d.",
      "To understand what happened, the BBC spoke to backpackers and a diplomat about the area.",
      "Our reporting found the town where travellers fell ill remains a party hotspot despite past efforts, with some success, to clean up its image, and that while the risk of methanol poisoning is known among consulates and tourism operators, travellers appear largely ignorant.",

      "Parents 'devastated' over daughter's suspected poisoning death",
      "Notorious party town",
      "Vang Vieng - a tiny town on the Nam Song river surrounded by limestone mountains and paddy fields - is known for its scenery.",
      "It is also known as a party town - a reputation Laos officials have been trying to shed over the past decade.",
      "A four-hour bus ride from the capital Vientiane, it has long been the stopping point on the Banana Pancake Trail backpacking route between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam before heading north to the ancient temples of Luang Prabang.",
      "In Vang Vieng, hostel bunks are advertised at less than \u20ac10 (\u00a38) a night, while a bucket of beer can cost half that. Drugs like marijuana and mushrooms are in ready supply, openly advertised at cafes and diners.",
      "During the early 2000s and 2010s the town was famous for hardcore partying and as a spot for riding inflatables down the local river. But after several tourists were injured or died, efforts were made at raising safety standards.",
      "\u201cTo combat the river tubing deaths they demolished a bunch of the riverside bars that were selling buckets of vodka to people floating by,\u201d one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.",
      "Laos officials aimed to re-centre the town as a spot for eco-tourism rather than just a hub for the young and drunk.",
      "\u201cAnd it worked,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s actually changed a quite a lot in the past decade, they\u2019ve cleaned it up, it\u2019s way more modern than it used to be.\"",
      "But because of that: \u201cI think it can be very easy for young travellers to miss that this is still a very poor country with lax regulations and safety standards.\u201d",
      "The diplomat said methanol poisoning - where alcoholic drinks are contaminated with a toxic compound - is well-known among consulates and tourism operators.",
      "Consulates are fairly regularly having to deal with cases of tourists who have fallen ill from dodgy drinks, the diplomat noted.",
      "South East Asia is documented as the worst region for methanol poisoning. Local producers making cheap alcohol often will not correctly reduce the toxic level of methanol produced in the process.",
      "Thousands of incidents are recorded every year in the region, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF).",
      "But for tourists, awareness around poisonous alcohol is low.",
      "British backpacker Sarisha told the BBC's Newsbeat programme that people did not seem to consider the risks of free drinks when she was recently staying at Nana Backpacker.",
      "Like most other hostels, happy hours were a daily staple at the venue as well as free shots of local vodkas as courtesies, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very party city,\u201d she said.",
      "What is methanol and how does it affect the body?",
      "Fake alcohol deaths highlight SE Asia's methanol problem",
      "Lingering fears",
      "Tourists still in town are now taking extra precautions after the shocking deaths.",
      "On Friday, Miika, 19, a Finnish backpacker staying at a hostel just 10 minutes walk from Nana Backpacker, told the BBC he and his friends had arrived in town two days ago. They were now only ordering bottled beers and rethinking river tubing because shots were included.",
      "\u201cNow because we know about this, we didn\u2019t really want to go there,\u201d he said.",
      "British woman Natasha Moore, 22, told the BBC she cancelled her booking for Nana Backpacker after hearing about the deaths.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so scary, I feel so overwhelmed\u2026 it feels like I\u2019ve escaped death, almost like survivor's guilt\", she said in a TikTok video warning other travellers.",
      "Her group arrived in the town two days after the poisoning, where \u201cit was still kind of hush hush, nobody really knew too much about what was going on\".",
      "She knew many travellers decided to skip the town and said there were signs in the hostel warning to be careful about drinks.",
      "She said she \"can't even count how many free drinks\" she had on her travels, but over five nights in Vang Vieng, she and her friends had no free drinks or spirits, only bottled alcohol.",
      "\u201cI feel so, so sad and upset for all the friends and family and the people still in hospital. It's just so unfair, we were just trying to have a good time,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Russia made its loudest threat yet of nuclear war, as Western powers bolstered Ukraine's arsenal.",
    "story": [
      "The stakes have never been higher in the Ukraine-Russia war.",
      "In the week that saw the conflict pass its 1000th day, Western powers substantially boosted Ukraine's military arsenal - and the Kremlin made its loudest threats yet of a nuclear strike.",
      "Here is how the last week played out - and what it means.",
      "The West bolsters Ukraine",
      "Late on Sunday night, reports emerged that outgoing US President Joe Biden had given Ukraine permission to use longer-range ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia.",
      "The move marked a major policy change by Washington - which for months had refused Ukraine\u2019s requests to use the missiles beyond its own borders.",
      "After the decision was leaked to the press, a volley of ATACMS missiles were fired by Ukraine into Russia\u2019s Bryansk region.",
      "The Kremlin said six were fired, with five intercepted, while anonymous US officials claimed it was eight, with two intercepted.",
      "Whatever the specifics, this was a landmark moment: American-made missiles had struck Russian soil for the first time in this war.",
      "Then on Wednesday, Ukraine launched UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia\u2019s Kursk region - where Ukrainian troops have seized a roughly 600-sq km (232 sq mile) patch of Russian territory.",
      "Later in the week, Biden added the final element of a ramped-up weapons arsenal to Ukraine by approving the use of anti-personnel landmines.",
      "Simple, controversial, but highly-effective, landmines are a crucial part of Ukraine\u2019s defences on the eastern frontline - and it is hoped their use could help slow Russia's advance.",
      "With three swift decisions, over a few seismic days, the West signalled to the world that its support for Ukraine was not about to vanish.",
      "Russia raises nuclear stakes",
      "If Ukraine\u2019s western allies raised the stakes this week - so too did Moscow.",
      "On Tuesday, the 1000th day of the war, Putin pushed through changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.",
      "The doctrine now says an attack from a non-nuclear state, if backed by a nuclear power, will be treated as a joint assault on Russia.",
      "The Kremlin then took its response a step further by deploying a new type of missile - \"Oreshnik\" - to strike the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.",
      "Putin claimed it travelled at 10 times the speed of sound - and that there are \"no ways of counteracting this weapon\".",
      "Most observers agree the strike was designed to send a warning: that Russia could, if it chose, use the new missile to deliver a nuclear weapon.",
      "Such posturing would once have caused serious concern in the West. Now, not so much.",
      "Since the start of the conflict nearly three years ago, Putin has repeatedly laid out nuclear \"red lines\u2019\" which the West has repeatedly crossed. It seems many have become used to Russia\u2019s nuclear \u201csabre-rattling\u201d.",
      "And why else do Western leaders feel ready to gamble with Russia\u2019s nuclear threats? China.",
      "Beijing has become a vital partner for Moscow in its efforts to soften the impact of sanctions imposed by the US and other countries.",
      "China, the West believes, would react with horror at the use of nuclear weapons - thus discouraging Putin from making true on his threats.",

      "That assessment was echoed by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said \"the threat is serious and real when it comes to global conflict\".",
      "The US and UK are now more deeply involved than ever - while the deployment of North Korean troops to fight alongside Russia saw another nuclear power enter the war.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Thursday that \"never before\" has the threat of a nuclear war been greater, blaming the US for its \"aggressive and hostile\" policy towards Pyongyang.",
      "Biden out, Trump in",
      "So, why are we seeing these developments now?",
      "The likely reason is the impending arrival of US President-elect Donald Trump, who will officially enter the White House on 20 January.",
      "While on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the war within \u201c24 hours\u201d.",
      "Those around him, like Vice President-elect JD Vance, have signalled that will mean compromises for Ukraine, likely in the form of giving up territory in the Donbas and Crimea.",
      "That goes against the apparent stance of the Biden administration - whose decisions this week point to a desire to get as much aid through the door as possible before Trump enters office.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 01:22:23 GMT",
    "summary": "These caves were unexplored for thousands of years, protected by swirling mists and terrifying tales.",
    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life.

    "summary": "How future talks will play out if another superpower comes to the fore, just as the US steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 01:49:21 GMT",
    "summary": "The video went viral after one of India's top designers Sabyasachi Mukherjee shared it.",
    "story": [
      "A video of a fashion shoot in India has gone viral and unexpectedly turned a group of underprivileged school children into local celebrities.",
      "The footage shows the children, most of them girls between the ages of 12 and 17, dressed in red and gold outfits fashioned from discarded clothes.",
      "The teenagers designed and tailored the outfits and also doubled up as models to showcase their creations, with the grubby walls and terraces of the slum providing the backdrop for their ramp walk.",
      "The video was filmed and edited by a 15-year-old boy.",
      "The video first appeared earlier this month on the Instagram page of Innovation for Change, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the city of Lucknow.",
      "The charity works with about 400 children from the city's slums, providing them free food, education and job skills. The children featured in the shoot are students of this NGO.",
      "Mehak Kannojia, one of the models in the video, told the BBC that she and her fellow students closely followed the sartorial choices of Bollywood actresses on Instagram and often duplicated some of their outfits for themselves.",
      "\"This time, we decided to pool our resources and worked as a group,\" the 16-year-old said.",
      "For their project, they chose wisely - a campaign by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, one of India's top fashion designers who has dressed Bollywood celebrities, Hollywood actresses and billionaires. In 2018, Kim Kardashian wore his sequinned red sari for a Vogue shoot.",
      "Mukherjee is also known as the \"king of weddings\" in India. He has dressed  thousands of brides, including Bollywood celebrities such as Anushka Sharma and Deepika Padukone. Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in a stunning red Sabyasachi outfit.",
      "Mehak said their project, called Yeh laal rang (the colour red), was inspired by the designer's heritage bridal collection.",
      "\"We sifted through the clothes that had come to us in donation and picked out all the red items. Then we zeroed in on the outfits we wanted to make and began putting them together.\"",
      "It was intense work - the girls stitched about a dozen outfits in three-four days but, Mehak says, they had \"great fun doing it\".",
      "For the ramp walk, Mehak says they studied the models carefully in Sabyasachi videos and copied their moves.",
      "\"Just like his models, some of us wore sunglasses, one drank from a sipper with a straw, while another walked carrying a cloth bundle under her arm.\"",
      "Some of it, Mehak says, came together organically. \"At one point in the shoot, I was supposed to laugh. At that moment, someone said something funny and I just burst out laughing.\"",
      "It was an ambitious project, but the result has won hearts in India. Put together on a shoestring budget with donated clothes, the video went viral after Mukherjee reposted it on his Instagram feed with a heart emoji.",
      "The campaign won widespread praise, with many on social media comparing their work to that of professionals.",
      "The viral video has brought enormous attention to the charity and its school has been visited by several TV channels, some of the children were invited to participate in shows on popular FM radio stations and Bollywood actress Tamannah Bhatia visited them to accept a scarf from the children.",
      "The response, Mehak says, has been \"totally unexpected\".",
      "\"It feels like a dream come true. All my friends are sharing the video and saying 'you've become famous'. My parents were full of joy when they heard about all the attention we are getting.",
      "\"We are feeling wonderful. Now we have only one dream left - to meet Sabyasachi.\"",
      "The shoot, however, also received criticism, with some wondering if showing young girls dressed as brides could encouraged child marriage in a country where millions of girls are still married off by their families before they turn 18 - the legal age.",
      "The Innovation for Change addressed the concern in a post on Instagram, saying they had no intention to encourage child marriage.",
      "\"Our aim is not to promote child marriage in any way. Today, these girls are able to do something like this by fighting against such ideas and restrictions. Please appreciate them, otherwise the morale of these children will fall.\""

    "summary": "Chuck Woolery was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "story": [
      "Nowadays, what makes a martini a martini? Robert Simonson, who wrote a book about the martini, said, \"It's funny: it's strict and loose at the same time.\"",
      "Everyone seems to have an opinion about the cocktail: \"Ingredients, proportions, garnishes \u2013 it's all subject to debate,\" Simonson said. \"I'm a purist. I would think it needs to be gin and vermouth. But I'm willing to bend and say, 'Okay, vodka and vermouth as well.' [However,] if there's no vermouth in there, I don't know how you can call it a cocktail.\"",
      "Simonson says the martini was probably named after a vermouth company. It was invented in America in the 1870s or '80s when bartenders mixed gin with vermouth, a fortified wine made with herbs and spices. \"It's a very big player in cocktail history,\" he said.",

      "Samantha Casuga, the head bartender at Temple Bar in New York City, says the reason why many people might not want vermouth in their martini is because, for years, vermouth was stored improperly. \"It should be in the fridge,\" she said.",
      "Casuga's classic martini is two parts gin, one part vermouth, with a twist of lemon. She suggests that you probably shouldn't order it the way James Bond does \u2013 shaken, not stirred. Casuga says she's always stirring, but some people like the show behind the bar when a bartender shakes their cocktail. \"Definitely, people love a good shake,\" she said.",
      "People also love to have a martini made just the way they want it. But Casuga understands why they might be so specific: \"To have your own preferences, not only listened to and then executed, is, like, that's luxury itself.\"",

      "The island of Maui is a mere dot in the enormity of the vast Pacific Ocean, but it's not hard to see why millions visit every year, and why there are some who never want to leave. Fleetwood Mac founder Mick Fleetwood fell in love with Maui decades ago, and put down deep roots. \"Long story, a long love affair,\" he said.",
      "\"But it really is your heart and your home?\" I asked.",
      "\"Uh-huh. People often think, 'Oh yeah, how often are you on Maui?'\" Fleetwood said. \"This is my home. No other place.\"",
      "As a young man he'd dreamed of a place, a club, where he could get his friends together, and 12 years ago he made it happen in the west Maui city of Lahaina:\u00a0 Fleetwood's on Front Street. The menu was eclectic \u2013 they served everything from Biddie's Chicken (just like Fleetwood's mom, Biddie, made it) to cookie dough desserts dreamed up by his children. It was also a place where Mick and friends could play. \"We created, I created, a band of people under a roof,\" he said. \"Instead of a traveling circus, it was a resident circus at Fleetwood's on Front Street.\"",

      "And then, in August of 2023, the music stopped.",
      "A wind-driven fire tore through western Maui, killing more than a hundred people, and consuming more than 2,000 buildings. Fleetwood was in Los Angeles when the fire started, and he hurried back to a scene of utter devastation.",

      "\"No.\"",
      "\"But at the same time, this was your family. This was your home. That must've been a huge loss.\"",
      "\"It was a huge loss,\" Fleetwood said. \"And in the reminding of it, that wave comes back. Today knowing we're doing this, I go, like,\u00a0Okay, this is gonna be \u2026 a day.\"",
      "We took a walk with Fleetwood down the street where his place once stood: the last time he was here, the place was still smoldering. \"Literally, parts of it were still hot,\" he said.",
      "More than a year later, the Lahaina waterfront is still very much a disaster zone.",
      "The decision about what to do with the land is still up in the air; the priority is housing for the displaced residents. But Fleetwood says he's determined to rebuild, just maybe not in the same place.",
      "Asked what he pictures in a new place, he said, \"For me, it has to encompass being able to handle playing music. There has to be music. We had it every day. That's a selfish request!\"",
      "But before anything is rebuilt, there's still a massive cleanup that needs to be completed here.",
      "\"We will see,\" he said. \"You have a blank [canvas] to paint on, and there's a lot of painting to do.",
      "\"You have to be careful, even in this conversation, of going like, 'How sad that was,' when really it's about, 'Yes, but now we need this.' In the end you go like, it happened. And what's really important is absorbing maybe how all these things happened, and can they be circumnavigated to be more safe in the future, and be more aware? Of course that's part of it. But the real, real essence is the future.\"",

      "Barry Enderwick is eating his way through history, one sandwich at a time. Every day from his home in San Jose, California, Enderwick posts a cooking video from a recipe that time forgot. From the 1905 British book \"Salads, Sandwiches and Savouries,\" Enderwick prepared the New York Sandwich.",
      "The recipe called for 24 oysters, minced and mixed with mayonnaise, seasoned with lemon juice and pepper, and spread over buttered day-old French bread.",
      "Rescuing recipes from the dustbin of history doesn't always lead to culinary success. Sampling his New York Sandwich, Enderwick decried it as \"a textural wasteland. No, thank you.\"\u00a0 Into the trash bin it went!",

      "He even has a traveling stage show: \"Sandwiches of History Live.\"",
      "From the condiments to the sliced bread, this former Netflix executive has become something of a sandwich celebrity. \"You can put just about anything in-between two slices of bread,\" he said. \"And it's portable! In general, a sandwich is pretty easy fare. And so, they just have universal appeal.\"",
      "Though the sandwich gets its name famously from the Fourth Earl of Sandwich, the earliest sandwich Enderwick has eaten dates from 200 B.C.E. China, a seared beef sandwich called Rou Jia Mo.",
      "He declared it delicious. \"Between the onions, and all those spices and the soy sauce \u2026 oh my God! Oh man, this is so good!\"",
      "While Elvis was famous for his peanut butter and banana concoction, Enderwick says there's another celebrity who should be more famous for his sandwich: Gene Kelly, who he says had \"the greatest man sandwich in the world, which was basically mashed potatoes on bread. And it was delicious.\"",
      "Whether it's a peanut and sardine sandwich (from \"Blondie's Cook Book\" from 1947), or the parmesian radish sandwich (from 1909's \"The Up-To-Date Sandwich Book\"), Enderwick tries to get a taste of who we were \u2013 good or gross \u2013 one recipe at a time.",

      "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Guthrie announced the death on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records label.",
      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:08:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Ridley Scott returns to ancient Rome with \"Gladiator II\" nearly 25 years after the Oscar-winning original.",
    "story": [
      "The original Gladiator debuted nearly 25 years ago, winning five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Now, director Ridley Scott is returning to ancient Rome with the long-awaited sequel, \"Gladiator II\" which hits theaters Friday.",
      "The film stars Denzel Washington,\u00a0\u00a0Connie Nielsen, and Pedro Pascal in a story set in the same brutal Roman Empire \u2014one that didn't leave Scott's mind in the years since its first release.",
      "\"Well, since 'Gladiator' one, I made 17 big movies. I was quite busy,\" Scott said.",
      "But he admitted, \"During that time, I kept thinking, well, we should be doing 'Gladiator II.'\"",
      "A new hero in the arena",
      "Scott brings a fresh take on the same empire fans loved in the first movie.",
      "In the original film, Russell Crowe played Maximus, a general-turned-gladiator battling for honor. This time, the spotlight is on Irish actor Paul Mescal, who stars as a slave fighting for his freedom in the same empire.",
      "Scott, who studied art before becoming a filmmaker, started crafting the sequel's storyboards before the script was even complete.",
      "\"I'm already thinking \u2026 images. I'm drawing as [the writer] is writing. So when I enter on the set, I've already pre-planned everything,\" Scott said. \"It's very efficient because we did 'Gladiator' in 51 days.\"",
      "The sequel opens with an ambitious attack scene involving three full-scale Roman ships.",
      "\"I'm going to make three full-scale real ships,\" Scott said, explaining how they were mounted on massive industrial movers. \"Each trolley is about 100 feet long.\"",
      "While Scott embraces old-school filmmaking, he's also excited about modern tools like CGI.",
      "While Gladiator II features thrilling battles, Scott says the film also explores timeless themes and reflects on the constants of human nature, cruelty and violence.",
      "\"It reminds you that Rome would have Christians walked into that arena and eaten alive. Men, women, and children\u2014for fun,\" he said. \"What on earth was in the minds of Romans in that particular point? And have we come very far away from that? It's extraordinary that's still happening. We don't learn by history.\"",
      "The challenge of a sequel",
      "At 86, Scott admitted it was daunting to follow up on his original masterpiece. \"In a funny kind of way, I feel like I'm in a sport. It is competitive,\" he said. \"You're fighting yourself and your own fear and your own insecurity.\"",
      "When asked about his favorite part of the movie, Scott said, \"I think I'm relieved it is so embraced. And so I'm the favorite as the whole movie. It's pretty good.\"",
      "\"Gladiator II\" is distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is part of CBS News' parent company, Paramount Global. \"Gladiator II\" hits theaters on Friday, Nov. 22.",

      "\"I was nervous,\" she said. \"People really, really, really feel protective, I think, about the first one. A lot of people have been saying to me on the streets, 'Don't do number two, because number one is so perfect.'\"",
      "Nielsen explained that her decision to return hinged on the quality of the\u00a0\"Gladiator II\"\u00a0script.",

      "Her agents reassured her it was after speaking with producers.",
      "\"They were like, 'Just tell her she's going to be happy.'\"",
      "Reflecting on her character's evolution, Nielsen expressed gratitude for the opportunity to portray a more mature Lucilla.",
      "\"I played that as a young woman, and it's incredible to get the opportunity to show or go through the story of what happened to her over almost half a lifetime,\" she said. \"To get to tell that story and to get to show like what this mature Lucilla like \u2014 who has she grown into?\"",
      "Nielsen praised director\u00a0Ridley Scott\u00a0for his collaborative approach.",

      "She also reflected on the on-screen tension during her character Lucilla's first meeting with her long-lost son Lucius, played by Paul Mescal.",

      "But with the help of some friends, the singer-songwriter released her new album, \"Consequences of the Crown,\" earlier this year, which is her 17th studio album.",
      "Lynne's breakout album \"I am Shelby Lynne\" came after a difficult decision to leave Nashville 25 years ago.",
      "Personal struggles",
      "Lynne, now 56, was 19 when she signed a record deal in Nashville. Her first single was a duet with George Jones.",
      "Despite that early success, Lynne's private life was weighed down by a secret and family tragedy. Coming up in Nashville in the late 1980s, Lynne had to hide the fact that she was gay. She also kept her family history in the shadows. In 1986, she lost both her parents when her father shot and killed her mother and then turned the gun on himself.",
      "The only constant and way to cope for Lynne was music.",
      "\"I think that's why I would turn mean as hell \u2026 just protect, protect, protect. I didn't know what trauma was, or PTSD. I just knew I had to sing,\" Lynne said.",
      "Frustrated with Nashville, Lynne moved to California and changed genres. It worked. In 2000, she made the album that still defines her. \"I Am Shelby Lynne,\" widely considered a soul-pop masterpiece, helped her win a Grammy for best new artist.",
      "Lynne says music \"saved me a hundred times,\" but she struggled with commercial success, sobriety and the legacy of her parents.",
      "\"I mean, now I'm at peace with it, because I love them and it allows me to miss them,\" she said. \"It took me just like a gong in the head going, you know, they did the best they could. They did.\"",
      "Return to Nashville",
      "When Lynne left Nashville, she wasn't planning on coming back. However, after years of living in California, she quietly returned to the South in 2018.",
      "\"To be quite honest, I didn't know if Nashville was mad at me,\" she said.",
      "It's in Nashville where Lynne confronted sobriety and accepted help from friends, something she has never found easy to do.",
      "\"I still got the devil in me, but people like Ashley [Monroe] and Karen [Fairchild] and Gena [Johnson] saved me. They saw me when I was here at my worst and I was really just trying to start over,\" she said.",
      "Songwriters Karen Fairchild of \"Little Big Town\" and Ashley Monroe started writing with Lynne upon her return.",
      "It was Fairchild and Monroe that pushed Lynne to make new music.",
      "\"We kept kind of bugging her about it,\" Fairchild said.",
      "\"'We want a Shelby record,'\" Monroe remembered telling Lynne. \"She's like, 'Nobody wants that.' We do.\"",
      "That persistence paid off.",
      "\"I was so nervous because, I mean, I've held her at the very top of all my lists,\" Monroe said.",
      "Their respect was also matched by their intimidation of working with one of their idols.",
      "\"It's like everybody has this reverence for her,\" Fairchild said of Lynne. \"And also like, there's fear\u2026 because she's a force.\"",
      "Fairchild and Monroe met with Lynne at the studio of engineer Gena Johnson to help create the album. Though hesitant about making new music, with a little help from her friends, Lynne eventually saw it all taking shape.",
      "\"It was on 'Butterfly' when she was like, ready to recognize that was a record coming to life,\" Fairchild said.",
      "This fall at the Americana Awards, Lynne was one of the Lifetime Achievement honorees.",
      "She said she finally feels like she fits in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm where I need to be,\" Lynne said. \"It is a great feeling. And it also means I can unpack those boxes in the garage. \"",

      "Chris Stapleton took home four Country Music Association Awards and hardly left the stage on Wednesday night, while an absent Morgan Wallen was shut out all evening until taking the night's biggest prize, entertainer of the year.",
      "Stapleton's wins included song of the year and single of the year for \"White Horse,\" and he took the stage at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, three times to perform during the ABC telecast, including a show-opening duet with Post Malone.",
      "\"I'm really honored for this, thank you very much,\" the always subdued country traditionalist Stapleton said as he accepted the male vocalist of the year award for a record-extending eighth time.",

      "\"I thought Chris Stapleton or Jelly Roll was going to win,\" Johnson said.",
      "Old Dominion won vocal group of the year for a record seventh straight time, surpassing the six won by Little Big Town.",

      "The telecast, available on Hulu for streaming Thursday, featured performances from artist combos including Brooks & Dunn, representing the 1990s and 2000s, with Jelly Roll, representing country's current moment. They gave an emotional gospel-style performance of Brooks & Dunn's 2005 song \"Believe.\"",
      "Brooks & Dunn followed it up by winning vocal duo of the year for the 15th time and the first time since 2006.",
      "Shaboozey brought the crowd to its feet with a solo performance that began with a bit of his more sober single \"Highway\" before launching into one of the year's defining hits, \"A Bar Song (Tipsy).\"",
      "But he lost out on best new artist to Megan Moroney, who won minutes after her own performance.",
      "\"Thank you Jesus for putting this dream on my heart,\" Moroney, a 27-year-old from Georgia, said with misty eyes as she accepted the award.",
      "Wilson opened the tribute to Strait by singing part of his best remembered hit, \"Amarillo by Morning.\"",
      "She was followed by Jamey Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Parker McCollum, Stapleton and Strait contemporary Clint Black, who performed pieces of Strait hits including \"Troubadour\" and \"Honky Tonk Hall of Fame\"",
      "Stapleton handed the 72-year-old Strait the award previously won by Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Charley Pride and Nelson himself, calling Strait \"true country music royalty, the king of country.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:34:47 -0500",
    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",
      "\"That's what I've been asking ever since I met you guys,\" Simon added with a smile.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:14:18 -0500",
    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:40:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",

      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",

    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "Officials suspect wild migrating birds are likely to blame for the first known infection of a flock in Hawaii, which had been the last state in the country with no reported cases in poultry or wild birds during the current outbreak.",
      "Sequencing done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national lab in Iowa confirmed the infection, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "The specific genotype of the virus that infected the birds is known as A3, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokesperson for the federal Animal Plant Health Inspection Services.",
      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",
      "At least 10 birds, which included ducks, a goose and a zebra dove, had been reported dead at the property on Nov. 12. Samples from the dead birds were sent to be tested for the virus.",

      "Confirmation of the infected flock in Hawaii follows a detection of the virus in the area from wastewater samples collected by the state earlier this month.",
      "Health officials around the country have been closely watching for signs of H5N1 spreading in their communities amid mounting cases in humans across North America.",
      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",
      "Health officials in Canada announced this month\u00a0that they had detected a case of H5N1 bird flu in a critically ill hospitalized teenager. That patient had been infected by the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which is related to another ongoing poultry outbreak in British Columbia, the Canadian province where they lived.",
      "Experts say the virus that infected the teenager does appear to have some worrying mutations, which might explain why the case was more severe.",

Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",

      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies.

      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",

      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",

      "McDonald's is planning to offer consumers savings in the form of \"McValue\" deals in 2025, the fast-food giant announced Friday.",
      "It's part of an effort to keep consumers chomping on burgers as some Americans lose their taste for fast-food amid rising prices even at what are usually reliably cheap dining alternatives.",
      "The McValue platform will be available in restaurants nationwide beginning Jan. 7, the company said. It will include McDonald's $5 meal deal, which the company launched in June. That offering includes either a McDouble burger of McChicken sandwich, four chicken McNuggets, a small order of fries and a small soft drink.",
      "In addition, the new McValue platform will introduce exclusive offers through its mobile app, and local food and drink deals. A new buy one, add one for $1 is also part of the offering. It applies to popular breakfast, lunch and dinner items like breakfast sandwiches, nuggets and burgers. When costumers buy one full-priced item from the McValue menu, they may add an additional item for just $1.",
      "\"When it comes to value, we know there's no one-size-fits-all. We've worked closely with our franchisees to create a new platform that will let our customers define value on their own terms,\" Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA said in a statement. \"From deals on their personal go-to order to universal favorites like the $5 Meal Deal, we're excited to give fans more ways to save every time they visit one of our restaurants.\"",
      "McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski acknowledged on the company's third-quarter earnings call last month that the restaurant's \"value leadership gap has shrunk\" and that it has been focused on improving its value offerings.

    "summary": "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza \u2014 also known as bird flu \u2014 is killing layer hens and reducing the nation's egg supply.",
    "story": [
      "Americans planning to do some holiday baking this year may have to scramble to track down a key ingredient.",
      "Some stores around the U.S. are running short of eggs, especially those operating in states that require eggs from cage-free hens, as cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) flare and the virus spreads from wild birds to commercial flocks. More than 40% of the nation's roughly 300 million egg-laying hens are raised in cage-free facilities, but roughly 60% of \"bird flu\" cases recently detected involved cage-free farms.",
      "\"After two months of no outbreaks, we had them recently in Utah, Oregon, California and Washington, and three of those states are exclusively cage-free,\" Emily Metz, chief executive and president of the American Egg Board, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Where we are hearing reports of shortages it's at stores like a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.\"",
      "After a brief respite from bird flu among commercial-egg producers, HPAI struck again starting in mid-October, resulting in the loss of 2.8 million birds. The nation's egg production fell 2.6% last month from a year ago and is projected to be down 1% this year versus 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service recently said in a monthly\u00a0report.",
      "The outbreaks, which began in January of 2022, have affected nearly 110 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, including wild, commercial and backyard flocks in 49 states, according\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the first time HPAI, also known as H5N1,\u00a0had been detected in the U.S. since 2016.",
      "The return of bird flu is wiping out poultry populations at commercial facilities in multiple states, most recently striking more than a million egg-laying hens in California's Kern County, where HPAI had been confirmed in 2.2 million egg-laying hens the prior week, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "More than 790,000 egg layers were also culled last week at a commercial operation in Arizona's Pinal County.",
      "How long do shortages last?",
      "The tighter egg supplies means the U.S. is experiencing \"hyper-localized shortages that are very temporary and intermittent and that are corrected sometimes within a day,\" said Metz, whose board markets and promotes eggs and egg products.",
      "\"There are local areas where supplies aren't quite as strong, so you might see pockets where shelves get picked over,\" said Brent Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "After HPAI-related shortages drove up egg prices in the spring, the virus is having the same impact this winter. Experts forecast that egg prices could stay elevated for the rest of the year and into 2025.",
      "As with the cost of other commodities, egg prices fluctuate with supply and demand, the latter of which has remained fairly stable over the year, regardless of cost, according to the Farm Bureau's Nelson. The egg board, however, said America's appetite for the protein has grown of late, rising steadily for 20 consecutive quarters.",
      "\"We see egg prices ride the wave as bird flu comes and goes,\" Nelson said. Right now, \"Bird flu infections are by far the biggest factor impacting egg prices.\"",
      "The national average for a dozen eggs is $3.37, up 30% from a year ago but lower than the January 2023 average of $4.82, the economist said. But some regions are seeing even higher prices. In California, white cage-free eggs were selling for about $5.26 a dozen last week \u2014 up nearly 90% from $2.81 during the same time in 2023, according to the USDA.",
      "Despite the price spikes, Nelson and Metz advised consumers against hoarding a perishable product like eggs, emphasizing that shortages typically pass quickly as retailers replenish their supplies.",
      "\"Eggs keep in the fridge really well \u2014 if you need them, go and get them,\" said Nelson.",
      "Added Metz, \"There is a hen for almost every person in the U.S., if they are not in the supermarket today, come back tomorrow.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

    "story": [
      "It's well-documented that women in the workplace often face biases when seeking leadership roles, but new research is uncovering just how pervasive and wide-ranging those prejudices can be.",
      "In the working world, women leaders report experiencing 30 types of identity factors that discriminate on everything from their body size to marital status, according to new\u00a0research from Wilson College chief information officer Amy Diehl, Westmont College dean Leanne Dzubinski and Clarkson University professor Amber Stephenson published in the peer-reviewed Human Resource Development Quarterly.",
      "The findings stem from the trio's 2023 research into age discrimination. That work, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that women in the workplace\u00a0face bias\u00a0regardless of their age, with their superiors often viewing them as too inexperienced if they are young and too unworthy of promotion if they are older. The new study surveyed more than 900 women in leadership roles in four industries where women comprise a large share of the workforce \u2014 health care, higher education, law and faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"Surprised and shocked\"",
      "\"The way we phrased the question was, 'Tell us about any other identity factors that are impacting your experience'\" in the workforce, Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We thought there would be age and race. We were surprised and shocked when we looked through the data and came up with 30.\"",
      "It's telling that the factors focus on personal qualities like class, marital status and sexual orientation, rather than professional qualifications or skills, underscoring that these biases aren't relevant to whether a woman can perform in the workplace, the researchers said.",
      "\"There is always an excuse masquerading as a reason given for a women about why she's not quite right for any role,\" noted Dzubinski.",

      "Stumbling on the broken rung",
      "While the new research focuses on women in their 40s and 50s who have already reached leadership roles, younger women are more likely to be held back by the so-called broken rung, or when women fail to get a promotion out of entry-level jobs at the same rate as men, research from consulting firm McKinsey and LeanIn, the nonprofit started by former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, has found.",
      "Their research found bias may play a role in stunting women's careers, with young men often promoted on their potential while young women are judged more on their track records.",
      "The new research on bias encountered by women in leadership roles didn't examine how women coped with bias as they climbed the professional ladder, although Diehl noted that women who rise into senior positions tend to \"have a thick skin,\" and might use techniques such as diverting conversations away from identity issues when they arise.",
      "Bias from other women",
      "The researchers focused on four industries where workers are either split equally between men and women or are female-dominated, although the top leadership positions in all these fields are typically held by men. The goal, in short, was also to examine the impact of gender bias in industries not dominated by men.",
      "The women leaders who responded to the survey were college presidents, vice presidents and provosts within higher education; physicians and physician administrators in health care; lawyers and partners within the legal field; and women who hold top leadership roles in faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"If you have women well represented in the industry, we're still seeing that women are still experiencing various types of bias,\" Stephenson said. \"It's a very real and very embedded situation within any workplace\" regardless of gender composition.",
      "Dzubinski added, \"It used to be the argument that as soon as you get more women in, it would fix itself \u2014 it's not fixing itself.\"",
      "Women can internalize bias and express it against other women in their workplace, while some might believe that there's not enough room at the top for more than a few women, the researchers noted. That can lead to the belief the only way to ascend into leadership roles is if another woman loses her spot, they said.",
      "Can you combat workplace bias?",
      "It's difficult for women to fight such biases, given that others may judge women negatively regardless of their situation, such as whether they are married or unmarried, both of which can trigger prejudices, the research noted.",
      "\"Notice that they are contradictions \u2014 if you are married, that's a problem, or if you aren't married that's a problem,\" Dzubinski told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you put them together you see that they are made up excuses\" to justify why women don't deserve promotions.",
      "While difficult, women should try not to take identity-based criticism personally, Diehl said.",
      "\"It feels very much, 'It's about me,' but it really isn't. It's about larger, systematic gender bias that's trying to force them out of the workplace or into supporting roles, and not leadership roles,\" she said.",
      "Organizations can deal with some of these issues by going over their practices and checking whether these identity factors are playing a role in whether people receive or are denied promotions, the researchers said. Another tool is to use a \"flip it\" strategy, applying the same statement about a woman to a man, such as \"John can't take on this role because he just had a child',\" they noted.",
      "With an onling push against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) from conservative lawmakers, some companies are dropping their investment in DEI. That could pick up speed under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he'll do more to remove these policies in his next term, while Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's handbook for the next conservative White House, proposes removing all federal rules and programs around DEI.",
      "But rooting out bias can help organizations perform better, the researchers noted.",
      "\"When woman after woman is dealing with all this stuff day after day, it takes time away from them doing their actual job,\" Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hurting the organization in terms of the amount of quality work they can get to.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court order reviving a shareholder lawsuit brought against the social media giant in light of consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's 2015 misuse of millions of Facebook users' data.",
      "In its first opinion of the term, the high court issued a one-line unsigned decision dismissing Facebook's appeal. The court's ruling indicates it believes it should not have taken up the case, though the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning.",
      "In tossing the appeal, the Supreme Court leaves in place a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in favor of Facebook shareholders. They had filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Facebook for allegedly misleading them in financial filings about the risks stemming from the massive data breach by Cambridge Analytica.",
      "The case involved what information publicly traded companies must disclose in the \"risk factors\" section of their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically, whether they're obligated to share risks that materialized in the past, even if those events don't present ongoing or future business harm.",
      "The dispute stems from a class action lawsuit that arose out of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica had purchased data collected through a personality quiz on Facebook and used it to create psychological profiles of U.S. voters to assist GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "While Cambridge Analytica said in the wake of the scandal that it deleted the data from Facebook, it was reported in 2018 that the firm had lied. Instead, it kept the information and used it to help then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Facebook's stock price was not impacted after Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data was revealed in 2015. But it plummeted in early 2018 after the consulting firm's ongoing misuse of Facebook data for the Trump campaign came to light.",
      "A group of investors who bought Facebook stock between February 2017 and July 2018 swiftly sued the tech giant in federal court, alleging the company's statements in the risk factors section of its 2016 10-K filing were misleading.",
      "In its filing, Facebook warned that \"security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\" The investors alleged the statements were inaccurate because they framed the risk of data misuse by third parties as hypothetical \u2014 even though Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data from Facebook members.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the claims, finding in part that the challenged statements weren't false because \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was [not] harming Facebook's reputation, business or competitive position\" when the company filed its 2016 risk disclosure.",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled for the shareholders and allowed their case to proceed, finding they adequately alleged Facebook's risk disclosures were misleading because the company \"represented the risk of improper access to or disclosure of Facebook user data as purely hypothetical when that risk had already transpired.\"",
      "Facebook then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the 9th Circuit's decision imposes \"expansive risk-disclosure requirements that will force public companies to inform investors of past incidents that pose no known threat to the business.\"",
      "The company also noted that there is a split among the federal courts of appeals as to what companies have to disclose on their SEC filings. One, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, doesn't require firms to disclose any past events in their risk factors, while other appeals courts require such disclosures only if the company knows the prior events will harm their business.",
      "Facebook said that the 9th Circuit's rule would open the door to lawsuits alleging \"fraud-by-hindsight\" and make risk disclosures burdensome to companies and less useful to investors as they seek to avoid liability.",
      "The Biden administration backed the shareholders in the case, arguing that \"it is plainly misleading to characterize an adverse event that has already materialized as a merely hypothetical future risk.\"",

      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",

      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "title": "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices, analysis finds",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:09:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could raise costs for U.S. consumers, economists say. Here's how much grocery bills could rise.",
    "story": [
      "Americans say they continue to feel the aftereffects of the highest inflation in four decades, especially at the grocery store, where prices remain 26% higher than before the pandemic. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could cause even more financial strain in the nation's food aisles by reigniting price hikes, according to a recent study.",
      "Although it remains to be seen what he does as president, ahead of the Nov. 5 election Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, as well as a 60% tariff on products from China. Manufacturers and retailers typically pass on at least some of those costs to customers.",
      "As a result, hefty new tariffs could cause prices for a range of consumer goods, from everyday items such as groceries to less frequent purchases like furniture, to rise, according to the\u00a0analysis\u00a0from Third Way, a left-leaning think tank. Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

      "Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of almost daily all-time highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",

      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:07:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Workers at the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with identifying improvements for federal agencies to protect public interests, have the highest median salary, at about $242,000, according to federal data.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:44:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA says America's food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" despite some recent high-profile recalls and outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

      "A study by AI firm Sensity found that Elon Musk is the most common celebrity used in deepfake scams. One likely reason is his wealth and entrepreneurship. Another reason is because of the amount of interviews he's done; the more content there is of someone online, the easier it is to create convincing deepfakes.",
      "Anatomy of a deepfake",
      "At the University of North Texas in Denton, Professor Christopher Meerdo is also using artificial intelligence. But he's using it to create art.",
      "\"It's not going to replace the creative arts,\" Meerdo said. \"It's going to just augment them and change the way that we understand things that we could do in the sphere of creativity.\"",
      "Even though Meerdo sees artificial intelligence as a way to be innovative, he sees its dangers.",
      "Meerdo showed the CBS News Texas I-Team how scammers can take a real video and use AI tools to replace a person's voice and mouth movements, making them appear to say something completely different.",
      "Advances in technology are making it easier to create deepfake videos. All a person who's familiar with AI needs to make one is a single still image and a video recording.",
      "To demonstrate this, Meerdo took a video of investigative reporter Brian New to create a deepfake of Elon Musk.",
      "These AI-generated videos are hardly perfect, but they just need to be convincing enough to deceive an unsuspecting victim.",
      "\"If you are really trying to scam people, I think you can do some really bad things with this,\" Meerdo said.",
      "How can you spot a deepfake?",
      "Some deepfakes are easier to spot than others; there can be signs like unnatural lip movements or odd body language. But as the technology improves, it will get harder to tell just by looking.",
      "There are a growing number of websites claiming they can detect deepfakes. Using three known deepfake videos and three authentic ones, the CBS News Texas I-Team put five of these websites to an unscientific test: Deepware, Attestiv, DeepFake-O-Meter, Sensity and Deepfake Detector.",
      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 12:11:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Thanksgiving dinners will cost less if you buy store-brand products. Here's how much savings they offer.",
    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

    "summary": "Americans struggling to stay financially afloat should consider debt relief before tapping into retirement accounts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "No one wants to file for bankruptcy, but if you're heading in that direction, delaying the inevitable may only make things worse.",
      "Bankruptcies are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but have gone up relative to last year. Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",

      "One of his most highly anticipated selections was Scott Bessent for Treasury. If confirmed, the 62-year-old investor would be the first openly gay secretary to lead it and responsible for quarterbacking Mr. Trump's proposed policies on taxes and tariffs.",
      "DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. President-Elect): The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.",

      "Mr. Trump selected a pair of doctors to lead health agencies. Former Congressman David Weldon has promoted debunked anti-vaccine views and is being tapped to lead the Centers for Disease Control. Food and Drug Administration pick Martin Makary critiqued vaccine mandates during the COVID pandemic.",

      "We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training.",
      "I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline.",
      "Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK Jr. at HHS secretary, Dave Weldon to CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65, and yet the Biden administration and Rochelle Walensky actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your 6-month-old, and the American public is rejecting this.",
      "Only about 20 percent of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster, because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's vaccination rates in other \u2013 other vaccines as well, not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles. There are concerns about other\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Right, but people have to believe it. Exactly.",
      "But people are doubting because they're being told that. I will give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines.",
      "But, like, when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just \u2013 my baby is new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months?",
      "So, really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country.",
      "I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees, from what I heard. You \u2013 you have been \u2013 I'm sorry. Did you want to say\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though.",
      "But you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57 percent of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters.",
      "The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40 percent say the U.S. military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard, and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I'm 100 percent supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people.",
      "Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say all-points bulletin, all in, but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. And we've \u2013 we've had a distrust of putting the Army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job, but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific.",
      "And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, if he's going to resist that, it will go all the way to the Supreme Court.",
      "And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is - - what he is offering is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government.",
      "Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and, really, I think, will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40-year period of time.",
      "What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially.",
      "How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image.",
      "But I will tell you that, just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the Army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol.",
      "And they have a list now of 15,000. I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list, you put these people on an all- points bulletin, these are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on, and they would go out and seek those people.",
      "That \u2013 we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes. That should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them. In all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from.",
      "So I think, if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the Army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching, carrying semiautomatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the Army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard, that specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors.",
      "I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or Army. I think there's a lot of FBI.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: There's a lot of Border Patrol agents. There's a better way to do it. And it needs to be individualized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor.",
      "Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I have heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive.",
      "I don't like tariffs, but, then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel. There are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, yes, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people.",
      "I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against Bessent, because it's also the president's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So, everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's part of one of the booms of postwar and post- Industrial Revolution. This amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits, that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.",
      "Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, in 2017, I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go. It's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue, that you have to have spending cuts.",
      "So, I have always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I have also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut spend \u2013 cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector, I think that's a good idea. But if you do it, I would cut spending.",
      "And there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64 percent polled by us think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington.",
      "Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "And I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "And so I think that the people are and would be overwhelmingly in favor\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 of someone who's going to base hiring on merit, not on racial characteristics.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become attorney general.",
      "This was after he had met with senators. And CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green-light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green- light. I'm glad that they held the line on him.",
      "I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And, you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected.",
      "But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of Defense, since you sit in this advisory role on Armed Services, I don't have to tell you, but, for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now, thousands of them in front-line combat roles.",
      "You were one of them in 2004, when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG, and you sustained severe injuries.",
      "Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving:",

      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on Armed Services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong.",
      "Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.",
      "And let me just make one thing clear. The women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in Special Forces or the SEALs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong, we don't \u2013 the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing.",
      "And so he's just flat-out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And, frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is.",
      "He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.",
      "Remember that the Pentagon is three million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And, frankly, women actually make our military more effective.",
      "And I have personally found that I brought many insights to my job when I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer that came from my own personal background that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all-male unit, and my gender didn't have \u2013 wasn't a problem.",
      "I just adapted, and we continued to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex.",
      "I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as \u2013 quote \u2013 \"rape, victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events.",
      "Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullin said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\"",
      "Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, that's \u2013 that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year.",
      "I hope that we will. But I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will make \u2013 raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and \u2013 and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma.",
      "It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel.",
      "Your colleague Senator Van Hollen said it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position. And, in fact, I have cosigned many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world.",
      "My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions. They don't actually have binding effect. And, frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now.",
      "And I am deeply concerned that a resolution that doesn't actually do anything might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and \u2013 American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience.",
      "But I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza. And, you know, I have cosigned many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration.",
      "With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as \u2013 as pro-union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Absolutely.",
      "I \u2013 you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back.",
      "I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign and a \u2013 for Mr. Trump.",
      "So it's about, are they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of Democratic control of the Senate and the White House, there's a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by end of December, pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill, and I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding. Emergency relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So, we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The president has now submitted $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So, I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone, is that right?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This is - that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, will support disaster relief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've always had the philosophy, all for one and one for all when Americans get hit by these disasters. I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, as you know, a new commander in chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies.",
      "But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as secretary of State, for example, or this new choice to be Labor secretary?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is, this is what the vetting process is all about, the hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. And I take that responsibility very seriously.",
      "I've been troubled by some talk that President-elect Donald Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do an end run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out.",
      "Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration, that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done. And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7th of last year, and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months the president will finally make more effective use of American leverage to, at the very least, uphold American law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you take a nuanced and specific stand on that, upholding U.S. law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them, who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department's reviewing 500 incidents where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be green lit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. weapons used in violation of the international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to put in a halt for a few weeks? And then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point? How do you respond?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The president had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level - at the senior level who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel, was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: For his obstruction on this. Even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean he's been ignored on other things, too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Palestinian Authority.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So, what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration. His latest book is \"At War with Ourselves,\" which chronicles his time at the White House.",
      "Good morning, and welcome back.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER (Retired, Former White House National Security Adviser): Good morning, Margaret. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy early Thanksgiving to you.",
      "I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks of the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S.-made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile, to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti-personnel land mines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office.",
      "Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, it's another one of these example how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons.",
      "And so, I think it's - it's important because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in. And you see Russia throwing troops into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking - you know, they're taking tens of thousands of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can, and they're trading some - some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces.",
      "So, the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of the - you know, how - what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, quote, \"push us out by January 20th,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation. He is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid. The vice president-elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's - it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.",
      "I think he'll - and what I hope is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.",
      "I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China's doing to sustain Russia's war-making machine with the cash Vladimir Putin needs but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran. Iran is providing the drones and missiles. North Korea's also providing, you know, eight million rounds of artillery. So, I think what's happened is, so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things - and you are a historian. You've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War with Ourselves\" was, \"it is important,\" based on your study of the Vietnam War, \"to ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\"",
      "Do you think so far that Mr. Trump's choices for director of national intelligence, for defense secretary, are these individuals who will provide the president with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to - has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76 where John Adams said, really this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn. He does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So, who will those people be?",
      "I think for the new secretary of defense, the nominated director of national intelligence, they ought to be asked, what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on - on the nominee for - for the - for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made. And I think as a result almost green lighted the invasion - the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.",
      "What are the consequences if - if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile or help President Trump reconcile peace through strength and what you see in some elements of the Republican Party which replicate the far left oftentimes toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries as - as - as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about, you know, how Putin really felt aggrieved. And that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated and in direct contradiction (ph) to what U.S. intelligence has concluded.",
      "I also want to ask you about someone you personally -",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And this is what - this is what I can't understand, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: There's some - there's some people in the Republican Party these days who kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a - kind of a defender of western civilization, just a shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who - who is - who is not going to stop in his efforts to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of re-establishing the Russian empire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And the only thing that stops him really is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin.",
      "Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the senior director for counterterrorism, deputy assistant to the president. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But I - you know, I think that - that the president and others who are working with him will probably determine that pretty quickly soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, timestamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The 2024 election was historic for several reasons. Among them, the first openly transgender person was elected to the United States Congress. She joins us now from the state she will be representing, Delaware. Democratic Representative-elect Sarah McBride.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): Thank you for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting given how polarized, how angry and divided this country is that people choose to serve and to run. You told my colleague, Scott MacFarlane, that it was your personal experience as a caregiver for your husband during his bout with terminal cancer that inspired you to run. Do you expect that health care policy will be the focus of your work here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I certainly am glad to be back here in Delaware after two weeks of orientation and to have the privilege of serving the state that I love in Congress.",
      "I ran to bring down costs facing workers, retirees, and their families. That means bringing down the cost of health care, but also housing and childcare and everyday expenses like gas and groceries.",
      "I did run for office after my experience as a caregiver to my husband, Andy, during his battle with cancer. And throughout that experience, while Andy ultimately lost his life, we both knew how lucky we were. We knew how lucky Andy was to have health insurance that would allow him to get care that would hopefully save his life. And we both knew how lucky we were to have flexibility with our employers that allowed Andy to focus on the full- time job of getting care and me to focus on the full-time job of being there by his side to care for him, to love him, to marry him, and to walk him to his passing.",
      "And I ran for office because I do not believe that in the wealthiest, most developed nation on earth, that that time and that ability to get care should be a matter of luck. I believe it should be the law of the land. And it's why during my time in the Delaware general assembly I passed paid family and medical leave and secured the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program. And I want to do that work in Congress on health care, but also on housing and childcare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Paid leave is something that Mr. Trump has - has paid lip service to. We'll see in the new Congress if it comes up.",
      "We see in our CBS polling that 86 percent of voters feel congressional Democrats should find common ground with Mr. Trump and Republicans.",
      "Do you feel you can?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I said throughout this campaign that I will work with anyone who's willing to work with me to help Delawareans, to lower cost facing my constituents. There are opportunities for us to find common ground. But it's also clear that this administration, as it begins to fill its appointments with Project 2025 authors, that a lot of the policies that this president will pursue will likely hurt my constituents and raise prices.",
      "And so, where I need to fight back, I will. But where I can find common ground, I will certainly seek it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: That's when I've done during my time in the general assembly where nearly every bill I passed, passed with bipartisan support.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe are you are being treated with dignity by your colleagues?",

I ran to deliver for Delawareans. And while Republicans in Congress seem focused on bathrooms and trans people and specifically me, I'm focused on rolling up my sleeves, diving into the details, setting up my office, and beginning the hard work of delivering for Delawareans on the issues that I know keep them up at night.",
      "And I look forward to working with any colleague who's ready to work and ready to be serious about the issues that matter because, at the end of the day, how I'm being treated does not matter. What matters is how the American people are being treated, and whether we're actually focused on the issues that matter to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of your fellow congressional Democrats, including Tom Suozzi and Seth Moulton, have also recently spoken about their feelings, looking back at the last election, and said Democrats should be more open about saying whether they object to transgender athletes playing in girls' sports. Those were the specific examples they brought up.",
      "How would you respond to your soon-to-be Democratic colleagues on those? Do you understand why some parents, for example, feel uncomfortable or frustrated?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Look, I think this country is still entering into a conversation about who trans people are, the full diversity of the community. And I've had conversations with colleagues in the Democratic caucus already that span diversity of thought about how the party should engage on a whole host of issues.",
      "But I think we are all united that every single American deserves equal rights, I think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean spirited but really an attempt to misdirect. Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract. It is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time - every single time we hear them say the word trans, look at what they're doing with their right hand. Look at what they're doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors while privatizing Social Security and Medicare. Look what they're doing undermining workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: And here's also what we have to be clear about, because I think the last week has been a prime example of this. Every bit of time and energy that is used to divert the attention of the federal government to go after trans people is time and energy that is not focused on addressing the cost of living for our constituents. And we have clear that there is a real cost for the American worker every time they focus on this.",

One of the things you've written in \"At War With Ourselves,\" was, it is important, based on your study of the Vietnam War, to \"ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\" Do you think so far, that Mr. Trump's choices for Director of National Intelligence, for Defense Secretary, are these individuals who will provide the President with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to- has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76, where John Adams said, really, this- this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn, he does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So who will those people be? I think, for the new Secretary of Defense, the nominated Director of National Intelligence, they- they ought to be asked, or- what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on- on the nominee for- for the- for- for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made, and I think, as a result, almost green lighted the invasion, the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022. What are the consequences if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds, globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile, or help President Trump reconcile, peace through strength? And what you see in some elements of the Republican Party, which replicate the far left, oftentimes, toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries, as- as- as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about how- how Putin really felt aggrieved, and that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's- that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated, and in direct contravention to what U.S. intelligence has concluded. I also want to ask about someone you--",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: This is what- this is what I can't understand, Margaret. There's so- there's some people in the Republican Party these days which kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points. I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a kind of a defender of Western civilization, just the shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who- who is- who is not going to stop in his effort to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of reestablishing the Russian Empire. And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do. And the only thing that stops it, really, is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin. Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the Senior Director for Counterterrorism, Deputy Assistant to the President. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But, you know, I think that- that the President, others who are working with him, will probably determine that pretty quickly, soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Time stamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 24, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, good to have you here.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of democratic control, the Senate and the White House has a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by the end of December, pass the defense bil l-the NDAA- and extension to the farm bill. And I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding- emergency Relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The President has now submitted a $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief, and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone. Is that right?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This- that's part of the Emergency Relief Fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike will support disaster relief. We've always had the philosophy\" all for one and one for all\" when Americans get hit by these disasters, I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon, and as you know, a new commander-in-chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies. But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, for example. Or this new choice to be labor secretary?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is this is what the vetting process is all about. The hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations, and I take that responsibility very seriously. I have been troubled by some talk that President-elect Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new Republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do it and run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out. Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done, and I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7 of last year and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the President had effectively used US leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely, and then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months, the President will finally make more effective use of American leverage to at the very least uphold American law, to insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza and they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you take a nuanced and specific stand on that upholding, US law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department is reviewing 500 incidents where US weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel is doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be greenlit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the President of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by secretaries Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500 as you said. And we haven't gotten the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process, because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen US weapons used in violation of international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM-20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that US weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed US officials on this privately, they've said, \"What do you want us to do? You want us to put in a halt for a few weeks and then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point?\" How do you respond to that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The President had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level- at the senior level, who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a cease fire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet, President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Why?--",
      "SEN. VAN HALLEN: \u2013for his obstruction on this, even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the President of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean, he's been ignored on other things too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the Palestinian Authority--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts, and yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books. So this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course, we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position. Thank you. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, of the state of Illinois. She sits on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Good morning, thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become Attorney General. This was after he had met with senators, and CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green light. I'm glad that they held the line on him. I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected. But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of defense, since you sit in this advisory role on armed services, I don't have to tell you, but for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now. Thousands of them in front line combat roles. You were one of them in 2004 when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG and you sustained severe injuries. Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving.",
      "[ PETE HEGSETH SOT ]",
      "PETE HEGSETH: I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "[ END SOT ]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on armed services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong. Our military could not go to war without the 220,000 plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal. And let me just make one thing clear, the women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in special forces or the COs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong. We don't. The ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing. And so he's just flat out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is. He was a pretty low ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately, unqualified for the position. Remember that the Pentagon is 3 million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And frankly, women actually make our military more effective. And I've personally found that I brought many insights to my job. When I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer, that came from my own personal background, that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all male unit, and my gender didn't have- wasn't a problem. I just adapted, and we continue to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex. I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as, \"rape: victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events. Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullen said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\" Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH",
      "Well, that's- that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year. I hope that we will, but I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and- and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma. It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "This past week, your committee did review a number of military promotions, nearly 1000 of them, and one name that seems to have been left off the list, despite the Pentagon's recommendation, was Lieutenant General Christopher Donahue. He was- he became known as the last U.S. service person to leave Afghanistan back in 2021, a key role there. Sources tell CBS that it is your Republican senator colleague, Senator Mullen, who stood in the way of this. I'm told it's out of a desire to hold those accountable for Afghanistan. What do you make of this? And is there a chance it could move?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH",
      "Well, if he is fully qualified for the move and for the promotion, he should come before the committee, the whole committee, not one member of the committee, and we should consider him. Remember that I wrote the legislation that created the Afghan War Commission. So we are actually undergoing, right now, an active, multi-year review of what happened in Afghanistan. And that was a bipartisan commission. We passed that law in a bipartisan way, and I hope the committee will be allowed to move forward with reviewing what happened to- in Afghanistan. It's, you know, you're not going to get a full picture by holding one person's promotion up. Frankly, he needs to come before the full committee, and we need to decide, and it's not Markwayne Mullen's decision whether or not one promotion comes before the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, I ask because there are concerns about whether there will be generals held to account by Mr. Trump, as he said, he thinks others should be fired for Afghanistan. But to move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel. Your colleague, Senator Van Hollen, said, it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position, and in fact, I have co-signed many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world. My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions, they don't actually have binding effect. And frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now, and I am deeply concerned that resolution, that doesn't actually do anything, might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience, but I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza, and you know, I've co-signed many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration. With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary, former Congresswoman Lori Chavez DeRemer. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as- as pro- union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Absolutely, I- you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins, over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back. I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump. So it's about were they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Thank you",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee. Welcome back to \"Face The Nation,\" Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training. I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline. Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK jr. at HHS Secretary, Dave Weldon, the CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy. I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65 and yet the Biden administration, Rochelle Walensky, actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your six-month-old. And the American public is rejecting this. Only about 20% of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Well its vaccination rates in other- other vaccines as well not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013Right but people have to believe it, right exactly, but people are doubting because they're being told that. I'll give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine, are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines, but like when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just- my babies new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, Why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months? So really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country. I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees. From what I heard you, you have been- I'm sorry, did you want to say?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SEN. PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though, but you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57% of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters. The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40% say the US military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I'm 100% supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people. Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say All-points bulletin, all in but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. We've, we've had a distrust of putting the army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to Judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific. And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, he's going to resist that it will go all the way to the Supreme Court. And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is- what he is offering, is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government. Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and really, I think will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40 year period of time. The. What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up. There are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially. How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS Secretary Kristi Noem?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image. But I will tell you, but just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen, and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol. And they have a list now of 15,000 I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list. You put these people on an All-points bulletin. These are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on. And they would go out and seek those people that we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes, that should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them, in all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from. So I think if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching carrying semi automatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right",
      "SEN. PAUL: Object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard. That specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors. I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or army. I think there's a lot of FBI, there's a lot of border patrol agents. There's a better way to do it, and it needs to be individualized. That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor. Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SEN.\u00a0 PAUL: You know, I've heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive. I don't like tariffs, but then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel, there are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel. So yeah, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people. I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against best and because it's also the President's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade. It's part of one of the booms of post-war and post-industrial revolution. These amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail. As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, in 2017 I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go, it's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue that you have to have spending cuts. So, I've always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I've also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut- cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector. I think that's a good idea, but if you do it. I would cut spending, and there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force, that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86% prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64% polled by us, think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington. Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Yes, and I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit. And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2013",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said that Pete Hegseth is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Sunday that Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform,\" Duckworth said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.\"",
      "Trump tapped Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as his pick to head the Defense Department earlier this month. The 44-year-old has drawn criticism for his stance on women in combat roles, along with his level of experience.",
      "Duckworth, who in 2004 deployed to Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot and sustained severe injuries when her helicopter was hit by an RPG, outlined that women who serve in combat roles have met the same standards as men, passing rigorous testing. She said Hegseth's position \"just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is,\" while arguing that he's \"inordinately unqualified for the position.\"",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform,\" Duckworth said. She added that having women in the military \"does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth has also drawn scrutiny amid recently unearthed details about an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017. Hegseth denies the allegation and characterized the incident as a consensual encounter. The Monterey County district attorney's office declined to file charges as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" His lawyer has acknowledged that Hegseth paid a confidential financial settlement to the woman out of concern that the allegation would jeopardize his employment.",
      "Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, said it's \"really troubling\" that Trump would nominate someone who \"has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him.\"",
      "\"This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense,\" she added.",
      "The comments come after Trump announced a slew of picks for top posts in his administration in recent days. Meanwhile, one pick \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general \u2014 has already withdrawn his name from consideration after he faced intense scrutiny amid a House Ethics Committee investigation and a tenuous path to Senate confirmation.",
      "While Duckworth acknowledged that she's glad her Senate Republicans \"held the line\" on Gaetz and also elected Sen. John Thune as leader over a candidate favored by many in Trump's orbit, she said she's \"deeply concerned\" her Republican colleagues will green light Trump's nominees.",
      "\"From what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump,\" Duckworth said.",
      "But Duckworth didn't rule out supporting some of the nominees herself during the Senate confirmation process, pledged to evaluate each candidate based on their ability to do the job, and their willingness to put the needs of the American people before \"a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a CBS News poll released on Sunday found that 33% of Americans say Hegseth is a \"good choice\" for defense secretary, including 64% of Trump voters. But 39% of Americans said they hadn't heard enough yet about the pick. More broadly, Americans generally say they want Trump to appoint people who'll speak their minds and who have experience in the field or agency they'll run.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said he believes that Hegseth can run the massive Defense Department, despite his lack of experience managing a large organization. Though he did not address Hegseth's comments about women in combat roles, Paul said he believes the \"vast majority of people\" support leaders who are picked based on merit, citing Hegseth's criticism of the Pentagon for what he says has been a move away from merit-based hiring and toward hiring based on \"racial characteristics.\"",

      "Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue was slated to be promoted to a four-star rank and take command of the U.S. Army in Europe. However, he was not included in a batch of nearly 1,000 promotions that moved through the Senate Armed Services Committee this week despite receiving a Pentagon recommendation.",
      "Mullin has put a hold on the promotion. The intention is to allow for the new Republican-controlled Congress and President-elect Donald Trump to weigh in on the promotion given Donahue's involvement in the Afghanistan withdrawal, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "Behind the scenes, there is an effort underway by the Army and other allies to convince Congress to move forward and lift the hold, which appears to be politically motivated, sources said.",
      "During\u00a0the campaign, Trump frequently mentioned his surprise that no officers were consequently fired by President Biden for the chaotic withdrawal.",

It was the Trump administration that in February 2020\u00a0brokered the deal\u00a0with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, but it was Mr. Biden\u00a0who decided\u00a0to execute that withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking the terms of that U.S. agreement.",
      "Donahue was the last U.S. soldier to exit Afghanistan in 2021. The U.S. evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its withdrawal, during which dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were killed\u00a0in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul.",

      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that if Donahue is \"fully qualified\" for the promotion, he should come before the full Armed Services Committee, rather than allow one senator to hold it up.",
      "\"We are actually undergoing, right now, an active, multi-year review of what happened in Afghanistan, and that was a bipartisan commission,\" Duckworth said. \"We passed that law in a bipartisan way, and I hope the committee will be allowed to move forward with reviewing what happened in Afghanistan.

Marco Rubio, who is Trump's pick to be secretary of state.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump nominated Dr. Marty Makary Friday to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who opposed vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Makary, a Johns Hopkins University professor, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system to be \"broken\" and in need of a shakeup.",
      "Makary has criticized in books and articles the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "\"I'm a part of a generation that says, 'We as a medical generation have made some mistakes, we've done things that resulted in a loss of the public trust and we need to be open and honest about our problems if we're going to fix it,'\" Markey\u00a0said\u00a0in a 2012 interview with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Trump announced the nomination in a statement Friday night, saying Makary would \"restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\" Makary will have to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though he was not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, Makary had concerns about vaccinations in young children.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, Makary was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "In a February 2021 Wall Street Journal piece, he wrote that \"COVID will be mostly gone by April, allowing Americans to resume normal life.\" That summer the delta variant of the virus ripped through the U.S., followed by omicron in the winter, leading to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.",
      "If Makary is confirmed and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also confirmed as Trump's pick to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, Makary would likely report to Kennedy. Makary does not share Kennedy's discredited views on vaccines, but he has a similar distrust of the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Makary has lamented that drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Makary would also inherit a number of ongoing projects at the FDA kicked off by outgoing Commissioner Robert Califf, including the reorganization of the agency's food division and plans to regulate artificial intelligence in medical technology.",
      "In the event of other controversial initiatives under Trump, career staffers may simply drag the work out until a new administration comes to power.",

    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",
      "\"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.",
      "Politics also runs in his family, as former Rep. John Jenrette was his uncle and is also known for serving a prison sentence for his role in 1980s Abscam scandal, South Carolina's Post and Courier reported.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:04:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump's new lawyers will have to decide how to handle hot-button issues before the high court this term, including cases on treatments for transgender youth and on ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court convenes for arguments in December, the justices will hear from the top lawyer for the Biden administration, who will urge them to strike down laws in nearly half the states that ban hormone treatments for transgender minors.",
      "In January, President-elect Donald Trump's new lawyers at the Justice Department will have to decide if the federal government still believes those laws are unconstitutional.",
      "How to handle ongoing cases before the Supreme Court is always one of the most consequential questions for a new presidential administration. It's a big task. Of the 45 cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear for its current term, which began in October, the United States is party to 21 of them, including the case over certain treatments for transgender youth. In many others, the Biden administration has outlined its view of the legal issues.",
      "In most of those cases, the Justice Department takes a predictable, even nonpartisan approach, such as by routinely defending federal criminal prosecutions on appeal.",
      "But other cases involve judgment calls that reflect the new administration's policy preferences.",
      "In addition to the transgender case, many others touch on hot-button issues: the Biden administration supported a federal regulation of ghost guns, which are weapons that people can buy in pieces and put together at home; it opposed a lower court's ban on a Texas law that requires people who access pornographic websites to prove they are adults; and it defended the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize flavored e-cigarette products for sale.",
      "But Trump's lawyers can flip these positions. As Chief Justice John Roberts noted in 2022, \"a new administration is of course as a general matter entitled to do that.\"",
      "How does it work? That depends.",
      "If the United States lost the case in the lower court, the new lawyers can simply dismiss the appeal.",
      "The Biden administration took this approach in a prominent 2020 abortion case over Trump's decision to bar federally funded health clinics from making abortion referrals. When a lower court struck down the policy, Trump's lawyers brought it to the Supreme Court, which agreed to consider the issue.. But after President Biden took office in early 2021, his legal team dropped the appeal and the case was removed from the Supreme Court's calendar.",
      "The Trump administration will now have to decide whether to withdraw its appeal in the transgender case. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, a Biden appointee who argues on behalf of the government before the Supreme Court, has argued that state laws that keep minors from taking hormones \"discriminate[] based on transgender status.\" Trump, who campaigned on getting \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools,\" is unlikely to see the issue the same way.",
      "But Trump's lawyers may consider staying the course if it looks like the Supreme Court disagrees with the Biden administration's position at oral argument early next month. This prospect seems likely because the ACLU is poised to pursue the case if the government drops out, making withdrawal by the new Trump administration potentially futile.",
      "The Trump administration's approach to the ghost-guns case is also unclear. At oral argument in October, the justices indicated that they had no issue with the Biden administration's regulations on these do-it-yourself weapons, buoying the spirits of gun-control advocates. If the Trump administration opposes the regulations on ghost guns, which subject these weapons to the same requirements as firearms sold commercially, it could dismiss the case, which would keep intact a lower court ruling that blocked the rule.",
      "In contrast, if another party is appealing a case that the U.S. won in the lower court, the approach of Trump's lawyers may depend on different factors.",
      "One factor is how far the case has progressed. In January 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a criminal-sentencing case. But before the parties submitted briefs outlining their arguments in the case, the Biden administration told the Supreme Court that \"following the change in administration, the Department of Justice began a process of reviewing the government's interpretation of\" the law and reversed course. The Supreme Court then appointed an outside lawyer to argue the Trump administration's previous position.",
      "And regardless, the Supreme Court's caseload may change if Trump rolls back Mr. Biden's policies. In 2017, Trump, in his first term, dropped former President Barack Obama's policy for bathroom use for transgender students right before a Republican challenge to the guidance landed at the Supreme Court, which brought an end to the case.",
      "Trump's new lawyers will have to make strategic choices against this backdrop.",
      "Some may involve how to portray the government's interests. The Supreme Court sometimes asks Justice Department lawyers to explain how a pending ruling might affect the government. Several of these kinds of requests are outstanding, including a Honolulu challenge that seeks to hold oil and gas companies accountable for the effects of emissions on the climate.",
      "And some choices might not even result in any change to the Supreme Court's current docket. One of the administration's jobs is to ask the high court to review upcoming cases. Trump's new lawyers may withdraw \u2014 or simply never pursue \u2014 certain appeals that the Biden administration teed up.",

      "The powerful next-level, multiple-warhead battlefield weapon, which has been analyzed by the Pentagon, has prompted NATO to hold an emergency summit on Tuesday. Among the cruise missiles intercepted in the assault was what the Defense Department has identified as a variant of the RS-26, an \"experimental\" intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a reconfigured Russian intercontinental ballistic missile, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The missile aimed at Dnipro in central Ukraine focused on one area, carrying six warheads about 750 miles from the launch location, in retaliation for Ukraine's attack earlier in the week on a military facility in Russia. Ukraine is bracing for more volleys.",
      "While publicly, U.S. officials say Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles, sources say these ballistic missiles pose a unique threat. They're capable of reaching 3,000 miles, and carrying a multiple-payload system. These systems are designed to carry and launch multiple warheads and to release them at different speeds and different directions, potentially over an area of more than 1,000 miles. They're also capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Heightening U.S. and NATO concerns further, it's the first time such a system has been used, and much still remains unknown about their utilization.",

    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund.

    "summary": "A new study says 86% of businesses and organizations hit by cyberattacks were targeted on a weekend or holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Just a week before Thanksgiving, shoppers at Stop & Shop stores across Massachusetts were forced to leave empty-handed after a cyberattack against the supermarket chain's parent company led to inventory shortages.",
      "Parent company Ahold Delhaize said in a statement earlier this month, that it had alerted law enforcement about the cyber breach and had taken some systems offline. \"While there may be some limited inventory for certain products, we are working to re-stock our shelves and anticipate item availability to continue to improve over the next few days,\" the company said. But the incident may be a sign of things to come during the holiday season, when cybersecurity crises are likely to peak.",
      "Already this year, corporate giants like AT&T, Ticketmaster and United Health have suffered paralyzing cyberattacks, and now, businesses are bracing for the holidays, a time when many cybersecurity operations rely on skeleton staffing. But the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning that it's no time for them to be taking a \"cyber vacation.\"",
      "The vast majority of ransomware attacks that hobbled businesses and organizations over the past year \u2014 86% \u2014\u00a0 occurred on a weekend or holiday, according to a new global study of 900 IT and security professionals released this week by cybersecurity firm Semperis. But researchers also found that 85% of surveyed organizations \u2014 90% in the U.S. \u2014 reduce security staffing by as much as 50% during those same periods.",
      "\"This study would say that we're not making thoughtful choices,\" former White House \"cyber czar\" and Semperis strategic adviser Chris Inglis told CBS News. \"If you realize that most of these attacks take place on holidays and weekends and you reduce your manning, you take away your opportunity to essentially have parity with your adversaries,\" said Inglis. He added, \"The advantage goes to the attacker, because they're not taking a day off. They never take a day off.\"",
      "According to the report, organizations consistently overestimate their defenses, with 81% of respondents reporting that they believe they have the necessary expertise to safeguard their digital identities from threats. Still, 83% of participants suffered a successful ransomware attack within the past year.",
      "Organizations are beginning to sense they're more vulnerable around the holidays, but Inglis suggested consumers, too, need to be vigilant. Technologies like smart phones and tablets are now cheaper and nearly ubiquitous, but safety measures have not kept up.",
      "\"We've not actually made the necessary investments to make it such that these technologies \u2014 or this system of technologies \u2014 is defensible and well defended,\" he said.",
      "According to the survey, mergers, acquisitions, stock launches or layoffs also functioned as \"magnets\" for ransomware attacks, with a majority of respondents \u2013 63% \u2013 also experiencing a cyber attack following what's known as a \"material corporate event.\"",
      "With financial executives predicting that President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House could usher in a wave of bank mergers and acquisitions, cybersecurity experts worry that cybercriminals will be able to take advantage of these \"moments of distraction.\"",
      "\"Our adversaries \u2013 be they criminal or foreign, rogue nations \u2013 they test the waters every day. They're conscious of the fact that our attention waxes and wanes,\" Inglis said. \"If there's a merger or an administration transition, those are moments of distraction. So we can expect that they will do what they always do. It's not that they search at this moment, it's that they see their opportunities being perhaps more productive at this moment.\"",
      "In February, UnitedHealth Group suffered the biggest hack in U.S. healthcare history after its acquisition of Change Healthcare meant it inherited outdated technology, with digital systems not yet safeguarded by multi-factor authentication.",
      "Beyond an anticipated onslaught of big bank deals, changes in administration \u2013 regardless of politics \u2013 have historically enticed foreign adversaries to test the defenses of new leadership in Washington. In 2021, President Joe Biden inherited fallout from a sophisticated Russian cyberattack leveled against Texas software-maker SolarWinds and used to breach roughly 100 top U.S. companies and a dozen government agencies.",
      "In June 2017, the Russian military waged the devastating 'NotPetya' cyber attack during Trump's first year in office, unleashing a virus that crippled parts of Ukraine's infrastructure and ravaged computer systems worldwide, amounting to billions in damages.",
      "Security staffing also remains a widespread challenge across industries, with just 85% of organizations maintaining a year-round, 24-hour Security Operations Center, according to Semperis, and staffing challenges prompted by higher overtime costs when most employees are typically out of the office around the holidays.",
      "Contributing to cybersecurity staffing headaches, cybersecurity workforce growth worldwide has flatlined for the first time since 2019. With growth of just 0.1% year-over-year in 2024, budget cuts, layoffs and hiring freezes have exacerbated a global staffing shortage of cybersecurity professionals, according to a recent report released by ISC2.",
      "The former U.S. national cyber director said that he's routinely asked what keeps him up at night. \"It's not the attackers, the Russians, the Chinese or any kind of ransomware actors. It's us,\" Inglis said. \"Sometimes, it's the complacency and the proactive ambivalence on our side that is actually, I think, more determinative of our future.\"",

      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia was released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach, officials said Friday.",
      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state's most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\" Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird's release, shared by the government on Friday.",
      "\"I'll miss Gus. It's been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn't have missed,\" she added.",
      "Biddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.",
      "\"He absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They're social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\" she said.",
      "Gus gained weight in her care, from 47 pounds when he was found to 54 pounds. He is 39 inches tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is farther south than Western Australia.",

      "Emperor penguins have been known to cover up to 1,000 miles on foraging journeys that last up to a month, the government said.",
      "They are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea\u00a0ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",
      "The demand for stock now requires all hands on deck. Logging companies like Collins Pine are helping the Forest Service source pine cones and clear scorched land for replanting.",
      "\"Fire and ecology and insects and disease \u2014 it doesn't care about a property line. So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",

    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",

      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",

    "story": [
      "Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched six space tourists on a high-speed dash to the edge of space and back Friday, giving the passengers \u2014 including a husband and wife making their second flight \u2014 about three minutes of weightlessness and an out-of-this world view before the capsule made a parachute descent to touchdown at the company's west Texas flight facility.",
      "Science popularizer and TV host Emily Calandrelli shed tears of elation after landing, telling an interviewer \"oh my gosh, when we got to weightlessness, I immediately turned upside down and looked at the planet, and then there was so much blackness, there was so much space! I didn't expect to see so much space!\"",
      "\"And I kept saying, like, that's our planet,\" she added, wiping away tears. \"That's our planet. It was the same feeling I got when my kids were born, and I was like, that's my baby, that's my baby. I had that same feeling like where I'm seeing it for the first time. It was just beautiful. Oh my God.\"",
      "Calandrelli, developer Marc Hagle and his wife Sharon, both making their second New Shepard flight, and three other entrepreneurs \u2014 Austin Litteral, James Russell and Henry Wolfond \u2014 blasted off from Bezos' sprawling ranch near Van Horn, Texas, at 10:30 a.m. EST. Accelerated to nearly three times the speed of sound, the crew capsule was released to fly on its own about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "As it continued coasting upward, the passengers were able to unstrap and float about the cabin during about three minutes of weightlessness, taking in the view of Earth below and space above from the largest windows ever built into a spacecraft.",
      "\"We got to MECO (main engine cutoff) and it was like BOOM! I'm not scared any more!\" Calandrelli said. \"That kick in your pants from (capsule-booster) separation is wild. It is wild. I had to tell my brain, like, this is normal, like, this is expected, it's supposed to be a kick in the pants.\"",
      "The launching marked Blue Origin's 28th New Shepard flight and the ninth with passengers on board. The company has now launched 47 individuals to space, including Bezos and three who have flown twice. It's not known how much Blue Origin charges for a ticket, but the company said Litteral won his seat in a contest sponsored by Whatnot, a livestream shopping platform.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump was on hand with Elon Musk for the sixth test flight of SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

    "summary": "Daisy's mission is two-fold: To waste scammers' time so they can't speak to real people and to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant.",
    "story": [
      "Meet Daisy \u2013 an AI-generated grandma created by British phone company Virgin Media O2 as the ultimate scam buster. Daisy's sole purpose is to talk to scammers all day so real people don't have to.",
      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",

He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

      "\"They still look like Elon Musk,\" she said. \"They still sound like Elon Musk.\"",
      "Deepfake scams on the rise in the U.S.",
      "As artificial intelligence technology evolves and becomes more accessible, these kinds of scams are becoming more common.",
      "According to Deloitte, a leading financial research group, AI-generated content contributed to more than $12 billion in fraud losses last year, and could reach $40 billion in the U.S. by 2027.",
      "Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau have issued warnings that deepfake scams are on the rise.",
      "A study by AI firm Sensity found that Elon Musk is the most common celebrity used in deepfake scams. One likely reason is his wealth and entrepreneurship. Another reason is because of the amount of interviews he's done; the more content there is of someone online, the easier it is to create convincing deepfakes.",
      "Anatomy of a deepfake",
      "At the University of North Texas in Denton, Professor Christopher Meerdo is also using artificial intelligence. But he's using it to create art.",
      "\"It's not going to replace the creative arts,\" Meerdo said. \"It's going to just augment them and change the way that we understand things that we could do in the sphere of creativity.\"",
      "Even though Meerdo sees artificial intelligence as a way to be innovative, he sees its dangers.",
      "Meerdo showed the CBS News Texas I-Team how scammers can take a real video and use AI tools to replace a person's voice and mouth movements, making them appear to say something completely different.",
      "Advances in technology are making it easier to create deepfake videos. All a person who's familiar with AI needs to make one is a single still image and a video recording.",
      "To demonstrate this, Meerdo took a video of investigative reporter Brian New to create a deepfake of Elon Musk.",
      "These AI-generated videos are hardly perfect, but they just need to be convincing enough to deceive an unsuspecting victim.",
      "\"If you are really trying to scam people, I think you can do some really bad things with this,\" Meerdo said.",
      "How can you spot a deepfake?",
      "Some deepfakes are easier to spot than others; there can be signs like unnatural lip movements or odd body language. But as the technology improves, it will get harder to tell just by looking.",
      "There are a growing number of websites claiming they can detect deepfakes. Using three known deepfake videos and three authentic ones, the CBS News Texas I-Team put five of these websites to an unscientific test: Deepware, Attestiv, DeepFake-O-Meter, Sensity and Deepfake Detector.",
      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",

      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Right, but people have to believe it. Exactly.",
      "But people are doubting because they're being told that. I will give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines.",
      "But, like, when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just \u2013 my baby is new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months?",
      "So, really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country.",
      "I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees, from what I heard. You \u2013 you have been \u2013 I'm sorry. Did you want to say\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though.",
      "But you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57 percent of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters.",
      "The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40 percent say the U.S. military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard, and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I'm 100 percent supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people.",
      "Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say all-points bulletin, all in, but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. And we've \u2013 we've had a distrust of putting the Army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job, but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific.",
      "And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, if he's going to resist that, it will go all the way to the Supreme Court.",
      "And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is - - what he is offering is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government.",
      "Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and, really, I think, will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40-year period of time.",
      "What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially.",
      "How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image.",
      "But I will tell you that, just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the Army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol.",
      "And they have a list now of 15,000. I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list, you put these people on an all- points bulletin, these are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on, and they would go out and seek those people.",
      "That \u2013 we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes. That should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them. In all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from.",
      "So I think, if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the Army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching, carrying semiautomatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the Army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard, that specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors.",
      "I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or Army. I think there's a lot of FBI.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: There's a lot of Border Patrol agents. There's a better way to do it. And it needs to be individualized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor.",
      "Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I have heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive.",
      "I don't like tariffs, but, then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel. There are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, yes, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people.",
      "I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against Bessent, because it's also the president's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So, everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's part of one of the booms of postwar and post- Industrial Revolution. This amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits, that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.",
      "Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, in 2017, I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go. It's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue, that you have to have spending cuts.",
      "So, I have always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I have also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut spend \u2013 cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector, I think that's a good idea. But if you do it, I would cut spending.",
      "And there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64 percent polled by us think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington.",
      "Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "And I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "And so I think that the people are and would be overwhelmingly in favor\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 of someone who's going to base hiring on merit, not on racial characteristics.",

      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Good morning. Thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become attorney general.",
      "This was after he had met with senators. And CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green-light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green- light. I'm glad that they held the line on him.",
      "I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And, you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected.",
      "But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of Defense, since you sit in this advisory role on Armed Services, I don't have to tell you, but, for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now, thousands of them in front-line combat roles.",
      "You were one of them in 2004, when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG, and you sustained severe injuries.",
      "Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving:",

      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on Armed Services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong.",
      "Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.",
      "And let me just make one thing clear. The women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in Special Forces or the SEALs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong, we don't \u2013 the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing.",
      "And so he's just flat-out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And, frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is.",
      "He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.",
      "Remember that the Pentagon is three million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And, frankly, women actually make our military more effective.",
      "And I have personally found that I brought many insights to my job when I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer that came from my own personal background that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all-male unit, and my gender didn't have \u2013 wasn't a problem.",
      "I just adapted, and we continued to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex.",
      "I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as \u2013 quote \u2013 \"rape, victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events.",
      "Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullin said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\"",
      "Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, that's \u2013 that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year.",
      "I hope that we will. But I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will make \u2013 raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and \u2013 and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma.",
      "It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel.",
      "Your colleague Senator Van Hollen said it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position. And, in fact, I have cosigned many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world.",
      "My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions. They don't actually have binding effect. And, frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now.",
      "And I am deeply concerned that a resolution that doesn't actually do anything might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and \u2013 American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience.",
      "But I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza. And, you know, I have cosigned many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration.",
      "With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as \u2013 as pro-union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Absolutely.",
      "I \u2013 you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back.",
      "I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign and a \u2013 for Mr. Trump.",

      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of Democratic control of the Senate and the White House, there's a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by end of December, pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill, and I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding. Emergency relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So, we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The president has now submitted $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So, I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone, is that right?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This is - that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, will support disaster relief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've always had the philosophy, all for one and one for all when Americans get hit by these disasters. I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, as you know, a new commander in chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies.",
      "But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as secretary of State, for example, or this new choice to be Labor secretary?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is, this is what the vetting process is all about, the hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. And I take that responsibility very seriously.",
      "I've been troubled by some talk that President-elect Donald Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do an end run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out.",
      "Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration, that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done. And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7th of last year, and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months the president will finally make more effective use of American leverage to, at the very least, uphold American law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you take a nuanced and specific stand on that, upholding U.S. law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them, who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department's reviewing 500 incidents where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be green lit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. weapons used in violation of the international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to put in a halt for a few weeks? And then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point? How do you respond?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The president had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level - at the senior level who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel, was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: For his obstruction on this. Even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean he's been ignored on other things, too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Palestinian Authority.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So, what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position.",

      "I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks of the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S.-made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile, to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti-personnel land mines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office.",
      "Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, it's another one of these example how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons.",
      "And so, I think it's - it's important because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in. And you see Russia throwing troops into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking - you know, they're taking tens of thousands of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can, and they're trading some - some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces.",
      "So, the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of the - you know, how - what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, quote, \"push us out by January 20th,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation. He is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid. The vice president-elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's - it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.",
      "I think he'll - and what I hope is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.",
      "I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China's doing to sustain Russia's war-making machine with the cash Vladimir Putin needs but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran. Iran is providing the drones and missiles. North Korea's also providing, you know, eight million rounds of artillery. So, I think what's happened is, so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things - and you are a historian. You've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War with Ourselves\" was, \"it is important,\" based on your study of the Vietnam War, \"to ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\"",
      "Do you think so far that Mr. Trump's choices for director of national intelligence, for defense secretary, are these individuals who will provide the president with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to - has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76 where John Adams said, really this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn. He does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So, who will those people be?",
      "I think for the new secretary of defense, the nominated director of national intelligence, they ought to be asked, what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on - on the nominee for - for the - for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made. And I think as a result almost green lighted the invasion - the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.",
      "What are the consequences if - if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile or help President Trump reconcile peace through strength and what you see in some elements of the Republican Party which replicate the far left oftentimes toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries as - as - as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about, you know, how Putin really felt aggrieved. And that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated and in direct contradiction (ph) to what U.S. intelligence has concluded.",
      "I also want to ask you about someone you personally -",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And this is what - this is what I can't understand, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: There's some - there's some people in the Republican Party these days who kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a - kind of a defender of western civilization, just a shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who - who is - who is not going to stop in his efforts to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of re-establishing the Russian empire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And the only thing that stops him really is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin.",
      "Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the senior director for counterterrorism, deputy assistant to the president. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But I - you know, I think that - that the president and others who are working with him will probably determine that pretty quickly soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, timestamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The 2024 election was historic for several reasons. Among them, the first openly transgender person was elected to the United States Congress. She joins us now from the state she will be representing, Delaware. Democratic Representative-elect Sarah McBride.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): Thank you for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting given how polarized, how angry and divided this country is that people choose to serve and to run. You told my colleague, Scott MacFarlane, that it was your personal experience as a caregiver for your husband during his bout with terminal cancer that inspired you to run. Do you expect that health care policy will be the focus of your work here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I certainly am glad to be back here in Delaware after two weeks of orientation and to have the privilege of serving the state that I love in Congress.",
      "I ran to bring down costs facing workers, retirees, and their families. That means bringing down the cost of health care, but also housing and childcare and everyday expenses like gas and groceries.",
      "I did run for office after my experience as a caregiver to my husband, Andy, during his battle with cancer. And throughout that experience, while Andy ultimately lost his life, we both knew how lucky we were. We knew how lucky Andy was to have health insurance that would allow him to get care that would hopefully save his life. And we both knew how lucky we were to have flexibility with our employers that allowed Andy to focus on the full- time job of getting care and me to focus on the full-time job of being there by his side to care for him, to love him, to marry him, and to walk him to his passing.",
      "And I ran for office because I do not believe that in the wealthiest, most developed nation on earth, that that time and that ability to get care should be a matter of luck. I believe it should be the law of the land. And it's why during my time in the Delaware general assembly I passed paid family and medical leave and secured the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program. And I want to do that work in Congress on health care, but also on housing and childcare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Paid leave is something that Mr. Trump has - has paid lip service to. We'll see in the new Congress if it comes up.",
      "We see in our CBS polling that 86 percent of voters feel congressional Democrats should find common ground with Mr. Trump and Republicans.",
      "Do you feel you can?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I said throughout this campaign that I will work with anyone who's willing to work with me to help Delawareans, to lower cost facing my constituents. There are opportunities for us to find common ground. But it's also clear that this administration, as it begins to fill its appointments with Project 2025 authors, that a lot of the policies that this president will pursue will likely hurt my constituents and raise prices.",
      "And so, where I need to fight back, I will. But where I can find common ground, I will certainly seek it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: That's when I've done during my time in the general assembly where nearly every bill I passed, passed with bipartisan support.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you mentioned, you were here for orientation. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was asking about you coming to work and some objections by a female South Carolina Republican representative regarding what bathroom you'd be able to use.",
      "Here's what the speaker said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): A man is a man, and a woman is a woman. And a man cannot become a woman. That said, I also believe - that's what scripture teaches, what I just said. But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe are you are being treated with dignity by your colleagues?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: I didn't run for the United States House of Representatives to talk about what bathroom I use. I didn't run to talk about myself. I ran to deliver for Delawareans. And while Republicans in Congress seem focused on bathrooms and trans people and specifically me, I'm focused on rolling up my sleeves, diving into the details, setting up my office, and beginning the hard work of delivering for Delawareans on the issues that I know keep them up at night.",
      "And I look forward to working with any colleague who's ready to work and ready to be serious about the issues that matter because, at the end of the day, how I'm being treated does not matter. What matters is how the American people are being treated, and whether we're actually focused on the issues that matter to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of your fellow congressional Democrats, including Tom Suozzi and Seth Moulton, have also recently spoken about their feelings, looking back at the last election, and said Democrats should be more open about saying whether they object to transgender athletes playing in girls' sports. Those were the specific examples they brought up.",
      "How would you respond to your soon-to-be Democratic colleagues on those? Do you understand why some parents, for example, feel uncomfortable or frustrated?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Look, I think this country is still entering into a conversation about who trans people are, the full diversity of the community. And I've had conversations with colleagues in the Democratic caucus already that span diversity of thought about how the party should engage on a whole host of issues.",
      "But I think we are all united that every single American deserves equal rights, I think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean spirited but really an attempt to misdirect. Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract. It is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time - every single time we hear them say the word trans, look at what they're doing with their right hand. Look at what they're doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors while privatizing Social Security and Medicare. Look what they're doing undermining workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: And here's also what we have to be clear about, because I think the last week has been a prime example of this. Every bit of time and energy that is used to divert the attention of the federal government to go after trans people is time and energy that is not focused on addressing the cost of living for our constituents. And we have clear that there is a real cost for the American worker every time they focus on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman-elect, I'm sure we'll be seeing you here in Washington.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "summary": "Chuck Woolery was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:08:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue was slated to be promoted to a four-star rank and take command of the U.S. Army in Europe.",
    "story": [
      "The promotion of a three-star general who was part of the 2021\u00a0U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan\u00a0has been paused by Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, three sources familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News Saturday.",
      "Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue was slated to be promoted to a four-star rank and take command of the U.S. Army in Europe. However, he was not included in a batch of nearly 1,000 promotions that moved through the Senate Armed Services Committee this week despite receiving a Pentagon recommendation.",
      "Mullin has put a hold on the promotion. The intention is to allow for the new Republican-controlled Congress and President-elect Donald Trump to weigh in on the promotion given Donahue's involvement in the Afghanistan withdrawal, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "Behind the scenes, there is an effort underway by the Army and other allies to convince Congress to move forward and lift the hold, which appears to be politically motivated, sources said.",
      "During\u00a0the campaign, Trump frequently mentioned his surprise that no officers were consequently fired by President Biden for the chaotic withdrawal.",
      "Military officers execute U.S. policy but do not create it. It was the Trump administration that in February 2020\u00a0brokered the deal\u00a0with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, but it was Mr. Biden\u00a0who decided\u00a0to execute that withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking the terms of that U.S. agreement.",
      "Donahue was the last U.S. soldier to exit Afghanistan in 2021. The U.S. evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its withdrawal, during which dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were killed\u00a0in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul.",
      "The U.S. underestimated the speed with which the Taliban would capture Kabul and the well-documented U.S. logistical and planning failures have been a focus of multiple internal probes at the Pentagon, State Department, and in Congress.",
      "An extensive State Department report\u00a0released last year\u00a0found that \"insufficient\" planning, communication failures and an inability to grasp \"the scale and scope of the operation\" contributed to the chaotic operation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Mullin's office but did not receive a response. It is not clear whether Trump is aware of the hold.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that if Donahue is \"fully qualified\" for the promotion, he should come before the full Armed Services Committee, rather than allow one senator to hold it up.",
      "\"We are actually undergoing, right now, an active, multi-year review of what happened in Afghanistan, and that was a bipartisan commission,\" Duckworth said. \"We passed that law in a bipartisan way, and I hope the committee will be allowed to move forward with reviewing what happened in Afghanistan. You're not going to get a full picture by holding one person's promotion.\"",

    "summary": "Democrats say they're concerned or scared Trump will threaten their rights, but fewer than half feel motivated to oppose him.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration starts off with mostly good will from the public: a majority of Americans overall are either happy or at least satisfied that he won and are either excited or optimistic about what he'll do as president.",
      "Trump's handling of his presidential transition gets approval from most Americans overall and brings near-universal approval from his voters, along with a net-positive response about his selections for Cabinet posts, in particular, Sen. Marco Rubio, who is Trump's pick to be secretary of state.",
      "After inflation and the economy so dominated the election, Americans are more inclined to think his administration will bring down prices for food and groceries rather than raise them, and his voters overwhelmingly say that. Going into the election, his backers expected that, too.",
      "In a similar vein, Trump's election already has some Republicans' views of the economy improving.",
      "Overall, Republicans today are more excited about what Trump will do as president now than they were in 2016 when he was first elected.",
      "Democrats say they feel more scared about what Trump might do than they did in 2016, and a large majority of Democrats think as president he will threaten their rights and freedoms. But at the same time, there seems to be a sense of exhaustion, as fewer than half of Democrats feel motivated to oppose Trump right now.",
      "Americans, and Democrats specifically, do think the Biden administration should work with the incoming Trump administration to ensure a smooth transition, and that congressional Democrats should work with Donald Trump on issues where they find common ground.",
      "Trump and the economy",
      "After winning comes expectations. There's a net optimism about the incoming administration's effect on food and grocery prices, especially among Trump's voters. That comes as most Americans continue to say prices are currently rising. And inflation was a big factor in Trump winning in the first place.",
      "It may be no surprise then that among many potential items for the incoming administration, Americans say plans to lower prices ought to be the top priority.",
      "The percentage of Republicans who call the U.S. economy good, while still low, has gone up, as the percentage who call it very bad has dropped. That pushes voters' overall evaluation of the economy slightly higher than it's been this year \u2014 and further spotlights how much partisanship, along with optimism, always plays into these evaluations.",
      "Trump selections of Cabinet and agency chiefs for his administration",
      "Trump's current selections for agency heads and Cabinet picks get rated overwhelmingly as good choices from Trump's voters, and are net-positive as selections among Americans who have heard enough about them to say. (Many have not heard enough yet.)",
      "As a general rule, Americans want Trump to appoint people who'll speak their minds and who have experience in the field or agency they'll run. But in addition to those qualities, Republicans also want people who'll be loyal to Trump.",
      "A large majority of Republicans and Trump voters think Elon Musk should have at least some influence in the Trump administration. Americans overall are more split on that, largely along partisan lines.",
      "Big majorities of Americans \u2014 and a slight majority of Republicans \u2014 would like to see the Senate hold hearings on his nominations, rather than let him make those appointments without it.",
      "(Within self-identified Republicans, MAGA Republicans are relatively more inclined to say the Senate should skip the hearings.)",
      "That sentiment holds whether or not people are told or reminded that the Constitution says the Senate should give advice and consent.",
      "As a general matter, though, most of Trump's voters and most Republicans do want Trump to have more presidential power this term than he did in his last. That sentiment is higher among Republican voters now than during the campaign.",
      "Trump policies",
      "On another economic front, Trump's voters overwhelmingly favor the idea of tariffs: most of them don't believe that will make prices higher. (For the third who believe tariffs will raise prices but support them anyhow, this is presumably a cost they're willing to bear.)",
      "For the public overall, opposition to tariffs goes hand in hand with the belief they'll lead to higher prices.",
      "As was the case with voters throughout the campaign, most Americans would, in principle, approve of a new mass deportation program.",
      "If the Trump administration does start a mass deportation program, most of the public would have it carried out by law enforcement or current immigration agencies \u2014 most would not have the U.S. military do it.",
      "Elections and democracy",
      "The 2024 results have shifted Republicans' views of U.S. democracy and also returned some confidence to their view of U.S. elections. Few Republicans suspect fraud in 2024. They overwhelmingly did about 2020.",
      "Following Trump's victory, there's been an increase in the number of Republicans who say democracy and rule of law is secure, though most Americans continue to say it is not.",
      "Looking ahead, there's another shift along partisan lines. Throughout the campaign, Republicans said America's best days were in its past, while Democrats felt they were in the future. These views are reversed now. After Trump's win, most Republicans feel America's best days are in its future.",

    "story": [
      "Forecasters around the United States have issued severe weather warnings ahead of another wave of winter storms that could potentially affect travel around the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Meanwhile, parts of the Pacific Northwest and California continued to recover from storm damage and widespread power outages, as they braced for more impact.",
      "In California, where a person was found dead in a vehicle submerged in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more precipitation while grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm. Thousands in the Pacific Northwest remained without power after multiple days in the dark.",
      "The National Weather Service office in Sacramento, California, issued a winter storm warning for the state's Sierra Nevada for Saturday through Tuesday, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 55 miles per hour. Total snowfall of roughly 4 feet was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations expected Monday and Tuesday.",
      "\"A weak low pressure system will continue directing a plume of moisture at the West Coast over the next few days,\" the Weather Prediction Center said in an advisory Sunday, which was effective through Tuesday. \"This will likely result in coastal and low elevation rain, while moderate to heavy snow proliferates across the coastal ranges of Washington, Oregon and California.\"",
      "The heaviest snow was expected to fall over sections of the Sierra Nevada, forecasters said, noting that areas in the Colorado Rockies would likely see snow showers, too, over the next few days. Another atmospheric river event was forecast to arrive in parts of central California on Tuesday.",
      "The Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, forecasters said.",
      "CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said the holiday outlook was still uncertain at the end of last week, but the weather system could bring rain and snow to the northeastern U.S. while causing temperatures to drop across most of the country, outside of the Southeast.",
      "\"While models can change in the days ahead, Thanksgiving Day is showing a low-pressure system moving across the East and entering the Northeast by evening hours,\" Nolan said Friday.",
      "A low-pressure system is forecast to bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast. Areas from Boston to New York could see rain and strong winds, with snowfall possible in parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. If the system tracks further inland, there could be less snow and more rain in the mountains, forecasters said.",
      "Earlier this week, at least two people died when severe weather struck the Pacific Northwest, bringing powerful wind and rain, closing schools, and causing widespread power outages. The two who died were killed by falling trees in Lynnwood and Bellevue, both in Washington state, officials said. Hundreds of thousands lost power, mostly in the Seattle area, before strong winds moved through Northern California.",
      "Rescue crews in Guerneville, California, recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Rob Dillion said, noting the deceased was presumed to be a victim of the storm but an autopsy had not yet been conducted.",
      "Santa Rosa, California, saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 12.5 inches of rain by Friday evening, the National Weather Service in the Bay Area reported. Vineyards in nearby Windsor, California, were flooded on Saturday.",
      "Some 80,000 people in the Seattle area were still without electricity after this season's strongest atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land. The atmospheric river overwhelmed parts of the Pacific Northwest as well as California, and was the strongest weather event of its kind seen all season.",
      "The storm system hit the area Tuesday. It was considered a \"bomb cyclone,\" which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. Although the intensity of the atmospheric river peaked later in the week, forecasters had warned that another bout of severe weather was still yet to come.",
      "The power came back in the afternoon at Katie Skipper's home in North Bend, about 30 miles east of Seattle, after being out since Tuesday. She was tired from taking cold showers, warming herself with a wood stove and using a generator to run the refrigerator, but Skipper said those inconveniences paled in comparison to the damage other people suffered, such as from fallen trees.",
      "\"That's really sad and scary,\" she said.",
      "Another storm brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where rare wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. The precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall.",
      "\"It's not going to be a drought buster, but it's definitely going to help when all this melts,\" said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York.",
      "Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 17 inches, with lesser accumulations in valley cities including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Less than 80,000 customers in 10 counties lost power.",
      "Precipitation in West Virginia helped put a dent in the state's worst drought in at least two decades and boosted ski resorts preparing to open their slopes in the weeks ahead.",

It's a story that drew international headlines because after being suspected of killing Wilson in Texas, Armstrong vanished -- seemingly into thin air. The search for the suspected killer sparked what would become an international manhunt -- first leading authorities across the United States, and then eventually to the beaches of Costa Rica.",
      "In June 2022, one month after Armstrong disappeared, Deputy U.S. Marshals Damien Fernandez and Emir Perez traveled to Costa Rica. A source told them Armstrong could be hiding out in Santa Teresa. They knew finding Armstrong in the small, tourist-filled village was going to be a challenge -- along the way, Armstrong used multiple identities and changed her appearance -- even getting plastic surgery.",

    "story": [
      "Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator from Oklahoma, presidential hopeful and populist who championed Democratic Party reforms in the turbulent 1960s, died Saturday. He was 94.",
      "Harris' wife, Margaret Elliston, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. He had lived in New Mexico since 1976.",
      "\"Fred Harris passed peacefully early this morning of natural causes. He was 94. He was a wonderful and beloved man. His memory is a blessing,\" Elliston said in a text message.",
      "Harris served eight years in the Senate, first winning in 1964 to fill a vacancy, and made unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1976.",
      "\"I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my longtime friend Fred Harris today,\" Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham wrote in a post to social media. \"Harris was a towering presence in politics and in academia, and his work over many decades improved New Mexico and the nation. \u00a0He will be greatly missed.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said in a statement that \"New Mexico and our nation have lost a giant,\" describing him as a \"tireless champion of civil rights, tribal sovereignty and working families.\"",
      "It fell to Harris, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1969 and 1970, to help heal the party's wounds from the tumultuous national convention in 1968 when protesters and police clashed in Chicago.",
      "He ushered in rule changes that led to more women and minorities as convention delegates and in leadership positions.",
      "\"I think it's worked wonderfully,\" Harris recalled in 2004, when he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \"It's made the selection much more legitimate and democratic.\"",
      "\"The Democratic Party was not democratic, and many of the delegations were pretty much boss-controlled or -dominated. And in the South, there was terrible discrimination against African Americans,\" he said.",
      "Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, quitting after poor showings in early contests, including a fourth-place win in New Hampshire. The more moderate Jimmy Carter went on to win the presidency.",
      "Harris moved to New Mexico that year and became a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. He wrote and edited more than a dozen books, mostly on politics and Congress. In 1999 he broadened his writings with a mystery set in Depression-era Oklahoma.",
      "Throughout his political career, Harris was a leading liberal voice for civil rights and anti-poverty programs to help minorities and the disadvantaged. Along with his first wife, LaDonna, a Comanche, he also was active in Native American issues.",
      "\"I've always called myself a populist or progressive,\" Harris said in a 1998 interview. \"I'm against concentrated power. I don't like the power of money in politics. I think we ought to have programs for the middle class and working class.\"",
      "\"Today 'populism' is often a dirty word because of how certain leaders wield power,\" Heinrich said in his statement Saturday. \"But Fred represented a different brand of populism \u2014 one that was never mean or exclusionary. Instead, Fred focused his work and attention on regular people who are often overlooked by the political class.\"",
      "Harris was a member of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the so-called Kerner Commission, appointed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to investigate the urban riots of the late 1960s.",
      "The commission's groundbreaking report in 1968 declared, \"our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\"",
      "Thirty years later, Harris co-wrote a report that concluded the commission's \"prophecy has come to pass.\"",
      "\"The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and minorities are suffering disproportionately,\" said the report by Harris and Lynn A. Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation, which continued the work of the commission.",
      "Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said Harris rose to prominence in Congress as a \"fiery populist.\"",
      "\"That resonates with people...the notion of the average person against the elite,\" Ornstein said. \"Fred Harris had a real ability to articulate those concerns, particularly of the downtrodden.\"",
      "In 1968, Harris served as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. He and others pressed Humphrey to use the convention to break with Johnson on the Vietnam War. But Humphrey waited to do so until late in the campaign, and narrowly lost to Republican Richard Nixon.",
      "\"That was the worst year of my life, '68. We had Dr. Martin Luther King killed. We had my Senate seatmate Robert Kennedy killed and then we had this terrible convention,\" Harris said in 1996.",
      "\"I left the convention \u2014 because of the terrible disorders and the way they had been handled and the failure to adopt a new peace platform \u2014 really downhearted.\"",
      "After assuming the Democratic Party leadership post, Harris appointed commissions that recommended reforms in the procedures for selecting delegates and presidential nominees. While lauding the greater openness and diversity, he said there had been a side effect: \"It's much to the good. But the one result of it is that conventions today are ratifying conventions. So it's hard to make them interesting.\"",
      "\"My own thought is they ought to be shortened to a couple of days. But they are still worth having, I think, as a way to adopt a platform, as a kind of pep rally, as a way to get people together in a kind of coalition-building,\" he said.",
      "Harris was born Nov. 13, 1930, in a two-room farmhouse near Walters, in southwestern Oklahoma, about 15 miles from the Texas line. The home had no electricity, indoor toilet or running water.",
      "At age 5 he was working on the farm and received 10 cents a day to drive a horse in circles to supply power for a hay bailer.",
      "He worked part-time as a janitor and printer's assistant to help for his education at University of Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1952, majoring in political science and history. He received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1954, and then moved to Lawton to practice.",
      "In 1956, he won election to the Oklahoma state Senate and served for eight years. In 1964, he launched his career in national politics in the race to replace Sen. Robert S. Kerr, who died in January 1963.",
      "Harris won the Democratic nomination in a runoff election against J. Howard Edmondson, who left the governorship to fill Kerr's vacancy until the next election. In the general election, Harris defeated an Oklahoma sports legend \u2014 Charles \"Bud\" Wilkinson, who had coached OU football for 17 years.",
      "Harris won a six-year term in 1966 but left the Senate in 1972 when there were doubts that he, as a left-leaning Democrat, could win reelection.",
      "Harris married his high school sweetheart, LaDonna Vita Crawford, in 1949, and had three children, Kathryn, Byron and Laura. After the couple divorced, Harris married Margaret Elliston in 1983. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available Saturday.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he will nominate former White House aide Brooke Rollins to be his agriculture secretary, the last of his picks to lead executive agencies and another choice from within his established circle of advisers and allies.",
      "The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office Jan. 20, 2025. Rollins would succeed Tom Vilsack, President Biden's agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programs related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition.",
      "Rollins, who graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in agricultural development, is a longtime Trump associate who served as his former domestic policy chief.

Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the Small Business Administration.",
      "Trump didn't offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign, but farmers could be affected if he carries out his pledge to impose widespread tariffs. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump's tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war.",
      "President Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The USDA oversees multiple support programs for farmers; animal and plant health; and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs that anchor the nation's food supply. Its federal nutrition programs provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children. And the agency sets standards for school meals.",

      "\"When you tell the story of landscape, you have to tell the story of people,\" said Michael Barthelemy, an enrolled member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and director of Native American studies at Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College. \"You have to tell the story of the people that first inhabited those places and the symbiotic relationship between the people and the landscape, how the people worked to shape the land and how the land worked to shape the people.\"",
      "The U.S. Forest Service would manage the proposed monument. The National Park Service oversees many national monuments, which are similar to national parks and usually designated by the president to protect the landscape's features.",

      "The $300 billion will go to developing countries who need the cash to wean themselves off the coal, oil and gas that causes the globe to overheat, adapt to future warming and pay for the damage caused by climate change's extreme weather. It's not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, but it's three times a deal of $100 billion a year from 2009 that is expiring. Some delegations said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future.",
      "But it was not quite the agreement by consensus that these meetings usually operate with and some developing nations were livid about being ignored.",
      "COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev gaveled the deal into acceptance before any nation had a chance to speak. When they did they blasted him for being unfair to them, the deal for not being enough and the world's rich nations for being too stingy.",
      "However, Chandni Raina, a representative for India's COP 29 delegation, slammed the deal.",
      "\"We are disappointed in the outcome which clearly brings out the unwillingness of the developed country parties to fulfil their responsibilities,\" said Raina, according to Reuters.",
      "She called it \"nothing more than an optical illusion,\" saying it \"will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres   also indicated in a social media post disappointment in the outcome, saying that he \"had hoped for a more ambitious outcome, on both finance and mitigation, to meet the great challenge we face.\"",
      "He said the agreement is a \"base on which to build. It must be honored in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash.\"",
      "In a statement, President Biden called the deal a \"historic outcome,\" saying it \"will help mobilize the level of finance \u2013 from all sources \u2013 that developing countries need to accelerate the transition to clean, sustainable economies, while opening up new markets for American-made electric vehicles, batteries, and other products.\"",
      "He added that \"in the years ahead, we are confident that the United States will continue this work...While some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's underway in America and around the world, nobody can reverse it \u2014 nobody.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he will, for a second time, exit the\u00a0Paris Agreement, which was signed in in 2016 and seeks to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius and carbon emissions keep rising.  The U.S. formally\u00a0withdrew\u00a0during Trump's first term, but then\u00a0rejoined under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, a long line of nations agreed with India and piled on, with Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, CEO of the National Council on Climate Change, calling the deal an insult and a joke.",
      "\"I'm disappointed. It's definitely below the benchmark that we have been fighting for for so long,\" said Juan Carlos Monterrey, of the Panama delegation. He noted that a few changes, including the inclusion of the words \"at least\" before the number $300 billion and an opportunity for revision by 2030, helped push them to the finish line.",
      "\"Our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over,\" he said.",
      "The final package pushed through \"does not speak or reflect or inspire confidence,\" India's Raina said.",
      "\"We absolutely object to the unfair means followed for adoption,\" Raina said. \"We are extremely hurt by this action by the president and the secretariat.\"",
      "Speaking for nearly 50 of the poorest nations of the world, Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi was more mild, expressing what he called reservations with the deal. And the Alliance of Small Island States' Cedric Schuster said he had more hope \"that the process would protect the interests of the most vulnerable\" but nevertheless expressed tempered support for the deal.",
      "There were somewhat satisfied parties, with European Union's Wopke Hoekstra calling it a new era of climate funding, working hard to help the most vulnerable. But activists in the plenary hall could be heard coughing over Hoekstra's speech in an attempt to disrupt it.",
      "Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister, called the agreement \"a huge relief.\"",
      "\"It was not certain. This was tough,\" he said. \"Because it's a time of division, of war, of (a) multilateral system having real difficulties, the fact that we could get it through in these difficult circumstances is really important.\"",
      "U.N. Climate Change's Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the deal an \"insurance policy for humanity,\" adding that like insurance, \"it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.\"",
      "The deal is seen as a step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It's part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.",
      "Countries also anticipate that this deal will send signals that help drive funding from other sources, like multilateral development banks and private sources. That was always part of the discussion at these talks \u2014 rich countries didn't think it was realistic to only rely on public funding sources \u2014 but poor countries worried that if the money came in loans instead of grants, it would send them sliding further backward into debt that they already struggle with.",
      "\"The $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,\" said World Resources Institute President Ani Dasgupta. \"This deal gets us off the starting block. Now the race is on to raise much more climate finance from a range of public and private sources, putting the whole financial system to work behind developing countries' transitions.\"",
      "And even though it's far from the needed $1.3 trillion, it's more than the $250 billion that was on the table in an earlier draft of the text, which outraged many countries and led to a period of frustration and stalling over the final hours of the summit.",

      "Around the world, women cook more meals per week than men \u2014 but Italy, already globally recognized for its cuisine, men are bucking that trend. It's the only nation in the world where men outcook the women.",
      "Cooking is a huge part of culture and family life in the European nation. Dinner rarely comes from a drive-thru or a box, with residents of the nation preferring freshly-made meals.",
      "\"I started cooking when I was a kid,\" said electrical engineer Ilario Tito.\"I learned from my grandmother, from my grandfather, to cook, also to shop (for) good food. And I like to eat.\"",
      "Sociologist Emiliana De Blasio, of Rome's LUISS University, told CBS Saturday Morning that for Italians, time spent cooking is akin to \"religion.\" It also provides a way for families and loved ones to gather. With more and more women joining the workforce and a the desire for good, home-cooked meals lingering, male identity in the nation is \"changing,\" according to De Blasio.",
      "\"So is tradition, is culture, is love, is also the potential to create a group and a family,\" De Blasio said. \"And so probably also men want all this power to create a group and family and to persist the heritage from the past to now.\"",
      "Eataly, a high-end food emporium in Rome, offers cooking classes that cover a variety of topics. When \"CBS Saturday Morning\" attended a class, most of the other students were men. One student, Roberto, said he came after his wife enrolled him in the class as a present.",
      "\"It's just to say 'Why don't you cook also during the night?'\" he said. \"Because we have a lot of fights.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another student, Riccardo, does the bulk of the cooking at the home he shares with his fianc\u00e9e, Chiara. She works late, so he cooks. He likes the time spent preparing a meal \u2014 and the look on his fianc\u00e9e's face when she comes home to a prepared table.",
      "\"I enjoy that moment. I'm very happy to do (for her),\" Riccardo said.",
      "But gender roles haven't changed everywhere. De Blasio joked that when it comes to doing the dishes, women usually pick up the slack.",

      "The powerful next-level, multiple-warhead battlefield weapon, which has been analyzed by the Pentagon, has prompted NATO to hold an emergency summit on Tuesday. Among the cruise missiles intercepted in the assault was what the Defense Department has identified as a variant of the RS-26, an \"experimental\" intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a reconfigured Russian intercontinental ballistic missile, according to a U.S. official.",

They're capable of reaching 3,000 miles, and carrying a multiple-payload system. These systems are designed to carry and launch multiple warheads and to release them at different speeds and different directions, potentially over an area of more than 1,000 miles. They're also capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Heightening U.S. and NATO concerns further, it's the first time such a system has been used, and much still remains unknown about their utilization.",

      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

The case echoed the ongoing high-profile trial that has shocked the nation in which 51 men are accused of raping Gisele Pelicot, drugged by her husband so he could invite strangers to their home to abuse her.",
      "The 38-year-old father was convicted by the court in the southeast Var region of forcing sexual acts on his daughter from the age of 13. Prosecutor Estelle Bois described how the father exercised total control over the young girl, his adoptive daughter. He also brought her to other men, many of them much older, who he contacted through online classified ads.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities have seen a surge of guns and ammunition flowing from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean, fueling conflict in regions already struggling with violence and unrest.",
      "Last week, U.S.-based airlines were struck by gunfire while flying over Haiti's airspace. While the origin of the firearms remains uncertain, Haiti has no domestic firearms manufacturing capacity, and aside from a small artisanal market, the majority of weapons fueling the violence are likely sourced from the U.S.",
      "A new report from research organization Small Arms Survey reveals a staggering nearly 120% surge in firearm shipments seized en route from the U.S. to the Caribbean and Latin America since 2016.",
      "\"Available evidence indicates that traffickers in the U.S. are a major source of illicit weapons in the Caribbean and Latin America,\" said Matt Schroeder, senior researcher at Small Arms Survey and author of the report. \"The illicit acquisition and use of firearms in the Caribbean and Latin America ranks among the most pressing security threats in the hemisphere.\"",
      "Their analysis, based on previously unpublished border seizure data obtained through public records requests, highlights a growing problem. These figures represent only the weapons actually seized, leaving out the vast number of guns trafficked across the U.S. or uncovered through criminal investigations. While it's unclear if these increases reflect more thorough screening, a rise in trafficking or improved data collection, the trend unmistakably points to a consistent demand for illicit firearms.",
      "The black market of American guns and ammunition has been well-established by U.S. and international law enforcement as a key source of weapons fueling humanitarian crises and violence in places like Mexico, Haiti and beyond. A 2023 CBS Reports investigation found up to a million firearms are smuggled across the border annually, including military-grade weapons like grenade launchers and belt-fed Gatling-style miniguns.",
      "The illicit flow of firearms is now a major concern across the Caribbean as well. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office shows that U.S.-sourced firearms account for the vast majority of the violence in Caribbean nations. The report states that 73% of the firearms recovered in the Caribbean between 2018 and 2023 were traced back to the U.S., with a significant portion of these weapons sold in Florida, Georgia and Texas. These firearms are responsible for 90% of homicides in some of the region's most vulnerable nations.",
      "The Small Arms Survey's latest findings reflect these broader trends, highlighting an increase in rifles seized as percentage of all interdicted firearms.",
      "Of the seized rifles headed for the Caribbean, 77% were AK- and AR-style rifles, compared with 48% in shipments to Mexico and 61% to other Latin American countries \u2014 though the total number of rifles seized while heading to the Caribbean remains lower than the quantities seized in shipments to Latin America. In the Caribbean-bound shipments, 93% of the magazines that were identifiable by capacity were capable of holding more than 10 rounds, making them high-capacity magazines.",

      "A Texas state lawmaker has introduced legislation to eliminate the death penalty in the state amid a high-profile death row case currently unfolding.",
      "Democrat state Rep. John Bucy III filed the bill for the upcoming legislative session.",
      "\"I think I've been opposed to the death penalty my whole life as I've thought about its use, and should it exist in our society,\" Bucy said, according to Fox 7.",
      "\"Financially, if you just want to look at it economically, we spend more money to execute than to keep someone in prison, so it's really a lose-lose situation with a high risk stake if we get it wrong,\" he continued.",
      "TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE'S LAWYER SAYS 'THERE WAS NO CRIME' AS SHE MAKES LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE HIS LIFE",
      "Photo shows the gurney in the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)",
      "This comes after the Texas Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the state to schedule a new execution date for inmate Robert Roberson, whose initial execution was delayed last month.",
      "Roberson is currently on death row over his conviction in which prosecutors say he killed his two-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, by shaking her to death, known as shaken baby syndrome. But his lawyers say Nikki actually died from other health issues such as pneumonia and that new evidence proves his innocence. His lawyers also said doctors had failed to rule out these other medical explanations for the child's symptoms.",
      "Roberson was scheduled to be put to death on Oct. 17 before the state Supreme Court issued a stay to delay his execution shortly before it was set to take place.",
      "If he is put to death, he would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed in a case based on shaken baby syndrome.",
      "More than 80 Texas state lawmakers, as well as the detective who helped the prosecution, medical experts, parental rights groups, human rights groups, bestselling novelist John Grisham and other advocates have called for the state to grant Roberson clemency over the belief that he is innocent. A group of state lawmakers have also visited Roberson in prison to encourage him.",
      "\"I feel like I've gotten more engaged with this Robert Roberson case and wanted to make sure that we're continuing this conversation about the lack of humanity tied to the death penalty,\" Bucy said.",

      "Texas has executed nearly 600 people since 1982, according to Texas Coalition to Abolish The Death Penalty executive director Kristin Houle Cuellar.",
      "\"Which is far more than any other state in the nation,\" Houle Cuellar told Fox 7. \"We have quite a reputation when it comes to the use of the death penalty in Texas.\"",
      "Houle Cuellar said that there have been fewer death sentences in the state in the last decade, which she partially attributes to the introduction in 2005 of life without parole.",
      "\"Prosecutors have used that discretion in opting not to seek the death penalty,\" Houle Cuellar said. \"Even in about 30 percent of the cases that they've taken to trial where they've sought the death penalty, jurors have rejected it.\"",
      "Houle Cuellar said that Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Bexar counties lead the state in death sentences and more than half of all Texas counties have never issued a death sentence.",
      "Since 2007, multiple Texas lawmakers have unsuccessfully sought to abolish the death penalty. But Bucy says there is now enough momentum regarding the issue to reintroduce legislation to eliminate the practice.",

      "State Sen. Sarah Eckhardt and state Rep. Joe Moody, both Democrats, have filed similar bills to abolish the death penalty, which will need to be voted on by fellow lawmakers when the legislative session begins early next year.",
      "In another Texas death row case, a judge found last month that Melissa Lucio was innocent in the 2007 death of her two-year-old daughter, Mariah. Senior State District Judge Arturo Nelson recommended that Lucio's conviction and death sentence be overturned. The judge also found that prosecutors suppressed evidence and testimony, including statements from Lucio's other children, that could support the claim that she was not abusive and that Mariah's death was accidental from falling down the stairs."

      "You might have seen it before since it\u2019s been going around for the past few years.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The Apple ID phishing emails have come a long way in recent years. They used to be plain text, had no Apple branding and didn\u2019t even greet or address the user. Now, though, they look almost identical to genuine Apple emails. These fraudulent emails claim your Apple ID has been suspended to trick you into giving up login credentials or other sensitive information. They come complete with an Apple logo, show \"Apple ID\" as the sender name and have a big blue button that says \"Go to Apple ID.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The email pretends to be from Apple Support, claiming your access has been suspended due to \"unusual activity\" or missing or invalid information. It says you can't access your account or Apple services until you verify your identity. There\u2019s usually a link that leads to a fake Apple site, asking you to enter your username, password and additional personal details to reactivate your account. To add urgency, it even warns that if you don\u2019t verify your Apple ID within 24 hours, it will be permanently blocked.",

      "If you\u2019re not paying attention, it\u2019s easy to get tricked into clicking the link in a scam like this. But if you\u2019re keeping an eye out, there are plenty of red flags. I\u2019ve added a sample phishing email below, and you\u2019ll spot the issues immediately. For one, it\u2019s not actually from Apple; the email domain is @uaepass.ae, which has nothing to do with Apple. Any legit Apple email will end with \"@email.apple.com,\" so anything else is an instant red flag.",
      "Then there\u2019s the awful grammar and punctuation. A company worth $3.37 trillion can definitely afford a decent content writer. You know someone at Apple is not going to mix up past and present tense like it\u2019s their first time writing an email.",
      "Take this gem: \"Therefore we need to re-verify your account data. if you did not verify your account within 48 hour, your account will be permanently locked, go to Apple ID and verify as soon as possible.\" It reads like someone smashed a bunch of words together and called it a day.

      "2. Look for spelling and grammar mistakes: Phishing emails often have poor grammar and punctuation. If the message sounds odd or looks like it was written by someone who doesn\u2019t know how to write well, be suspicious.",
      "3. Don\u2019t click on suspicious links: If the email asks you to click a link, don\u2019t do it right away. Hover over the link to see the actual URL. If it doesn\u2019t look like an official Apple website (or any site you trust), don\u2019t click it.",

      "5. Verify directly with Apple: If you\u2019re ever unsure about an email or message, go directly to Apple\u2019s official website or contact their support team. Don\u2019t use any contact info provided in a suspicious email.",
      "6. Invest in data removal services: Scammers often use personal information that\u2019s readily available online to craft more convincing phishing attempts. By investing in data removal services, you can reduce the amount of personal data that\u2019s exposed on the web, making it harder for scammers to target you effectively.",

      "A person typing on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The hidden costs of free email",
      "Free email services may not charge you money directly, but they often monetize your data in other ways. These providers typically engage in data collection and analysis, which can lead to targeted advertising and tracking of your email activity.",
      "As a result, they create comprehensive user profiles that can compromise your privacy and increase your vulnerability to cyber threats. Users often find themselves inundated with ads tailored to their interests, while their sensitive information remains at risk of misuse.",

      "Benefits of privacy-focused email services",
      "Secure email providers offer several advantages over their free counterparts. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices. They offer an ad-free experience and give you greater control over your personal information. This means that when you choose a secure email service, you are investing in a platform that prioritizes your privacy and security.",

      "Steps to switch to a secure email service",
      "Switching to a secure email service involves several steps that can enhance your online security. First, you should research and choose a provider that meets your needs by comparing features, pricing and user reviews. Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward. To further enhance security, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your new account to add an extra layer of protection.

      "The value of investing in privacy",
      "While paying for an email service might seem unnecessary at first glance, it is an investment in your privacy and security that can yield significant benefits over time. By choosing a subscription-based model, you support the development of privacy-focused technologies that prioritize user interests over advertising revenue. This ensures that the service remains accountable to you rather than marketers or corporate investors.

      "However, the fine print linked under \"Privacy Policy\" that you agree to at checkout often comes with a long list or, worse still, an unspecified number of third parties with which your data will be shared. Retailers often sell personal information and purchase histories to third parties, such as marketing companies and data brokers, who use it to build detailed consumer profiles. Once it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s very hard to remove your information from these third-party databases.",

      "After the shopping extravaganza of Black Friday, your inbox and phone may experience their own dark moments. A surge in spam is widely reported during the month of November. This unwanted communication can come from several sources.",

      "1. Create alias email addresses.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of best secure and private email services here.",
      "2. Use a\u00a0password manager to consistently use complex passwords that you can change frequently.",
      "3. Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from emails unless you are sure they are from a trusted source. Scammers or hackers can easily change the name of the sender to make it look like it came from a legitimate organization such as Amazon or an individual.\u00a0 But if you click the email header, you will see the sender's actual email address. By pretending to be a reputable organization, the crooks send urgent messages to make you click on links, reply or provide personal information in an attempt to fix a problem or claim a reward. If you click on a malicious link, then a scammer may be able to access your email and other personal data.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software on all your devices:\u00a0The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Malicious links are often disguised as legitimate ones, but they can download malware onto your device without your knowledge. Malware is a type of software that can damage your device, steal your personal information, or give hackers access to your data. Hackers can then use your data for various purposes, such as\u00a0identity theft, fraud or blackmail. This is why it is important to have antivirus software that can detect and remove malware before it causes any harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Go directly to the official site where you have any accounts, such as your financial institution, to check if any changes or charges were made instead of clicking links in the email you received or responding to the email. This way, you can avoid falling for phishing scams and keep your account secure.",
      "6. Limit the number of accounts or profiles you create with your personal email account.",
      "7.\u00a0Regularly scrub your personal information on the internet. You don\u2019t want spammers to take your email and add it to their lists, do you? That would result in annoying and potentially dangerous messages flooding your inbox. To prevent that, you need to make sure your personal information is not exposed on the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "If a scammer gets hold of your email address, they can use it to access your other accounts, send phishing emails to trick you into revealing your passwords or personal details, or even impersonate you to commit fraud or other crimes. This is why it is important to protect your email address from falling into the wrong hands and to act quickly if you suspect that it has been compromised. Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1. If you can regain control of your accounts,\u00a0change your passwords and inform the account provider.",
      "2. Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use\u00a0identity theft protection services to manage your personal information on and offline. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using identity theft protections services is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4.\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5. You may wish to get the professional advice of a lawyer\u00a0before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft, and if being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing.",
      "6.\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7. Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Navigating the world of online shopping during Black Friday can be a thrilling yet daunting experience. While the discounts are enticing, they often come with hidden costs \u2014 namely, your personal data. As you prepare your shopping list, consider utilizing tools to safeguard your information. These resources can help you maintain your privacy while enjoying the benefits of online shopping.

    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of gift-giving can quickly turn into anxiety over package theft. With porch pirates on the prowl, your carefully delivered gifts can vanish right from your doorstep. In 2023 alone, a staggering\u00a0119 million packages were reported stolen, meaning one in every 180 deliveries disappeared into thin air.",
      "Cities like Seattle, Memphis and San Diego have become hot spots for these unfortunate heists.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself racing home to rescue a package, asking neighbors to keep an eye out or, worst of all, falling victim to these sneaky thieves, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got some tips that could save you from the holiday headache of package theft. Let\u2019s dive in.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",
      "Pro tip: If your camera has the feature, set your video camera to notify you when it identifies packages within view.",
      "GET MORE OF MY TOP PICKS TO AMP UP YOUR HOME SECURITY",
      "Image of a doorbell camera (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 2: Use tracking apps",
      "Next up, make sure you're using tracking apps for your deliveries. Most shipping companies offer tracking services that let you follow your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at your home.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "If you sign up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, you\u2019ll get digital previews of what\u2019s coming to your mailbox, which is super handy. You can set up email or text alerts for delivery updates so you\u2019re always in the loop about when your packages are arriving. Some retailers even send you photos once your package has been delivered, giving you extra reassurance that it made it safely.",
      "A woman using a tracking app on her iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY LAPTOP DEALS",
      "Tip 3: Make sure someone is home",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected. If that\u2019s not possible, coordinate with friends, family members or roommates so someone is always there to grab\u00a0the delivery right away.",

      "A woman receiving packages at home (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS",
      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",
      "A person picking up packages for their neighbor (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",
      "KURT\u2019S UNBEATABLE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS",
      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",
      "When you're checking out, just click on\u00a0Change next to your shipping address, then select\u00a0Find a pickup location near you to see your options. Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",
      "A person picking up a package from a locker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 8: Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery",
      "We added a strong deadbolt to the door leading into the house from the garage before signing up. Now, when we are not home, an Amazon delivery can be placed securely inside our garage using the free service called Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery. The addition of a\u00a0smart garage controller is the first step. Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",
      "A delivery being made using Amazon Key-In-Garage Delivery (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 9: Provide a delivery box",
      "Another great option is to invest in a\u00a0delivery box that allows packages to be securely dropped off and stored discreetly. Just remember that you'll need to inform delivery personnel about using the box and how it works.",
      "Package being placed in a delivery box (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 10: Sign up for delivery notifications",
      "You can get an alert each time a package arrives at your doorstep.\u00a0Both FedEx and UPS will send a text when you've just received a delivery.\u00a0Amazon will also send you a shipment text letting you know a package has just been delivered.",

      "Researchers from China and Brazil have created a robotic dog known as CyberDog, specifically designed to locate fire ant nests. This high-tech robot has been trained to identify red imported fire ants, which are wreaking havoc in various ecosystems around the globe. Impressively, the CyberDog is capable of finding three times more nests than human inspectors, all while showing off greater accuracy.",

      "ROBOT DOG IS MAKING WAVES WITH ITS UNDERWATER SKILLS",
      "Why fire ants are such a big deal",
      "Red imported fire ants may be small, but their impact is anything but trivial. Native to central South America, these aggressive ants have spread across the United States, Australia and parts of Asia, causing extensive environmental and economic damage. In the U.S. alone, they are responsible for an estimated $6 billion in losses each year due to reduced crop yields and damage to farm equipment.",

      "Published in the\u00a0SCI journal Pest Management Science, the study showcases how the CyberDog robot, equipped with an AI model, can efficiently automate the identification and control of red imported fire ants, a notoriously destructive global pest. The research team trained the CyberDog using a comprehensive dataset of over 1,100 images of fire ant nests, resulting in an impressive detection accuracy rate of over 90%.",
      "The robot is programmed to poke suspected nests with its paw; when it does so, active nests release their workers in a defensive frenzy, confirming the presence of fire ants. This unique method allows researchers to distinguish between active mounds and those that may be abandoned or occupied by other species.",

      "More than just ant control",
      "Beyond its practical applications in pest management, the CyberDog also serves an educational purpose. Zheng Yan, one of the researchers involved in the project, emphasizes that sightings of robots tracking fire ant nests can captivate public interest and raise awareness about the dangers posed by invasive species. By engaging communities in this way, scientists hope to foster greater understanding and proactive measures against these ecological threats.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s immigration policy is in desperate need of a high-tech overhaul.\u00a0 Most online immigration tools so far have been rudimentary, and that\u2019s often left legal immigrants complaining of long wait times, contradictory instructions, and a web presence that doesn't help with things like green card renewal or family petitions.\u00a0 Now President-Elect Trump is promising a big deportation push when he comes into office for his second term, and it\u2019s more important than ever for immigrants to have their paperwork in order.",
      "\"Immigration, legal immigration should be efficient and accessible and affordable for everyone,\" says Yasaman Soroori, the co-founder and CEO of Consulta, a new A.I.-powered platform offering high-tech solutions for those immigration issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s thought to be the first online platform dedicated specifically to helping legal immigrants navigate America\u2019s complicated immigration landscape.\u00a0 Their goal is simple;\u00a0 integrating tech with personalized support, hoping to bring order and affordability to a complex and costly process.",
      "And Soroori says their intake protocol is much more simple and cost-effective than going to see an immigration attorney.\u00a0 \"Once the user finds us on our website and goes to the platform,\" she explains, \"they are able to select the service that pertains to them, answer a simplified questionnaire, upload the necessary documents, we\u2019ll even take care of the passport pictures for them. And that's it.\"",
      "As the immigration debate heats up, Consulta is getting more visibility; it has a number of high-profile backers, including the founder of Venmo.\u00a0 Right now, services include renewing green cards, petitions for family visas, and help with citizenship.\u00a0 It\u2019s all part of using A.I. to deliver a more streamlined immigration experience.",
      "\"We always talk about the negativity about immigration, but we don't focus on the legal immigrants that are in this country,\" says Soroori. \"And we wanted to offer them the most stress free, affordable option in order for more people to pursue it.\""

At that time, there was no confirmation from the retailer itself. However, a breach notification site has now confirmed that the personal data of 56,904,909 users was found online and leaked from customers of Hot Topic, Torrid and Box Lunch.",

      "The breach notification service\u00a0Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) announced this week that it alerted 56 million Hot Topic customers about a data breach compromising their personal information. While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",
      "Satanic alleges that the database contains details of 350 million users, though that number seems inflated. The leaked data does, however, include names, email addresses, physical addresses and dates of birth; all information collected through Hot Topic\u2019s loyalty program. The hacker is offering the database for $20,000 and demanding that Hot Topic pay $100,000 to prevent its sale.",
      "Hudson Rock, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, initially reported the breach and considers it credible. The firm traced the issue back to a malware infection on an employee\u2019s computer at Robling, a third-party retail analytics firm. Hudson Rock, which operates the cyber intelligence platform Cavalier to monitor compromised devices, discovered the infection and flagged it for clients.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the threat actor used credentials stolen by info stealer malware to gain access to an analytics platform used by Hot Topic, potentially allowing them to infiltrate the retailer\u2019s cloud environments.",

Hot Topic\u2019s silence could mean a few things, especially with such a big breach.

      "1) Keep a strong password:\u00a0With the Hot Topic data breach exposing sensitive information, it\u2019s essential to update your passwords. Use a strong, unique password for each account, especially for services where your personal details are stored. A mix of letters, numbers and symbols will make it harder for hackers to guess. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",
      "2) Beware of suspicious links:\u00a0After a breach, phishing attempts increase, and hackers may use your leaked email to send fake links or emails. Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Invest in a data removal service:\u00a0Since your personal information could be floating around on the dark web or public databases, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a data removal service.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored. Set up alerts for transactions and logins so you can act fast if anything seems off. Regular monitoring can help you catch fraudulent activity early, minimizing the damage if your data is misused.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Hot Topic data breach is alarming, especially since it affects over 56 million people. What makes the situation even more concerning is that Hot Topic has stayed silent about it. The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses. This situation is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene, whether you\u2019re impacted by a breach or not.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the National Security Agency advises weekly phone reboots to protect against cyberattacks and enhance mobile security.",
      "The telecom industry is one of cybercriminals' favorite targets, likely because of the sensitive data it stores. Your carrier knows who you call and what you text. This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",

      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",

In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data.

      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details.

And he had an opportunity to explain himself and explain what he did, why he acted, how he acted, what he perceived. And so much of it is consistent with not only the evidence in the case, but the testimony in the case.\"",

      "It was the second time that the word \"homicide\" came up controversially and prompted the defense to raise an objection. Earlier this week, Wiley ordered the first comment stricken, when Dr. Harris mentioned that \"all homicide reports\" were reviewed by another doctor in the city medical examiner's office.",
      "Not all homicides are criminal, and the defense argued that the prosecution's repeated espousal of the word could confuse the jury.",
      "The defense asked the court to note for the record that they have had several conversations, and the DA\u2019s office agreed that bringing up testimony from forensic pathologists regarding death as a \"homicide\" would be misleading to the jury.",

Eight percent of Black people in this country have sickle trait, which is a benign medical condition that rarely causes any symptoms, let alone death.\"",
      "At the autopsy, Harris found significant \"sickling\" on Neely's organs, she testified, and lawyers on both sides asked for an explanation. She said the condition did not contribute to Neely's death, and she blamed it solely on asphyxiation from the chokehold.",
      "\"Sickle trait red blood cells do sickle after death, when the body's oxygen supply disappears and can be seen at autopsy \u2013 as with Neely or with anyone with sickle trait dying from any condition,\" Baden said. \"It's a post-mortem artifact like rigor mortis. Further, death from sickle disease takes days of sickling to occur; it can't occur in seconds as happened to Neely.\"",

      "Sitting in for Ambassador Linda-Thomas-Greenfield, he said the draft's demand for \"an unconditional cease-fire with Hamas means this council accepts Hamas retaining power in Gaza. The United States will never accept this.\" He termed the resolution as a way to \"embolden Hamas.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "DOJ officials say Todd Blanche, a former federal prosecutor, knows its tradition of blocking politicians from influencing criminal investigations, but he faces a daunting task.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When Matt Gaetz abruptly\u00a0withdrew\u00a0as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s candidate for attorney general on Thursday, many career attorneys in the Justice Department breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "Hours later, though, Trump nominated\u00a0former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime loyalist who backed the former president\u2019s lies about the 2020 election and said\u00a0\u201chorrible\u201d people in the department were trying to make names for themselves by \u201cgoing after Donald Trump and weaponizing our legal system.\u201d",
      "Justice Department attorneys now hope that Trump\u2019s pick for the critical No. 2 position at the department \u2014 Todd Blanche, the president-elect\u2019s defense lawyer \u2014 can help protect the department\u2019s career civil servants from Trump\u2019s wrath.",
      "If confirmed as deputy attorney general by the Senate, which is widely expected, Blanche will no longer serve as Trump\u2019s defense lawyer. He will then, like all DOJ officials, take an oath to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States\u201d and be required to adhere to the department\u2019s conflict of interest rules.",
      "People close to Blanche say his past work as a career federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York gives him an understanding of the department\u2019s tradition of barring presidents and politicians from influencing individual criminal investigations.",
      "Many current DOJ officials hope that Blanche, who will oversee day-to-day operations in the department, can help prevent a worst-case scenario: Trump wielding federal law enforcement as a cudgel against his political enemies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s more the kind of guy I would have expected. Intelligent, former federal prosecutor, experience working as an attorney, no statutory rape,\u201d said a source inside the Justice Department, referring to the allegation that Gaetz\u00a0paid a 17-year-old for sex, which the former congressman has denied. \u201cYou know, small things like that.\u201d",
      "Close relationship with Trump",
      "Blanche served as Trump\u2019s lead criminal defense lawyer in the\u00a0Stormy Daniels hush money case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump was ultimately\u00a0convicted\u00a0of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and became the first former president to be convicted of a crime.",
      "Blanche, who until recently was a\u00a0registered Democrat,\u00a0left\u00a0the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in early 2023 to represent Trump in the case. Trump's sentencing has been repeatedly\u00a0delayed\u00a0and may never happen now that he\u2019s the president-elect.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance transition team, praised Blanche and said that Trump was re-elected by the American people to \u201cchange the status quo in Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why he has chosen brilliant and highly-respected leaders, like well-respected attorney and prosecutor Todd Blanche to serve in his Administration,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "She did not respond to questions from NBC News about whether the administration would maintain the long-standing policy of limiting White House contacts with DOJ officials and whether Blanche would follow the ethics recommendations of career DOJ officials.",
      "Some current and former DOJ officials say Blanche\u2019s\u00a0close relationship and record of\u00a0legal work with Trump has raised concerns. They are concerned that Blanche won\u2019t stand up to Trump, who throughout his first term repeatedly flouted post-Watergate\u00a0restrictions\u00a0on contacts between the Justice Department and the White House that are in place to stop presidents from using federal law enforcement to target their political enemies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the president\u2019s personal criminal defense attorney. That\u2019s what his job will be,\u201d said one law enforcement official. \u201cHe\u2019s there to protect the president, not the American people.\u201d",
      "Other Justice Department employees were cautiously optimistic that Blanche \u2014 whom one referred to as \u201cthe closest thing to \u2018Team Normal\u2019 that we\u2019ll see\u201d \u2014 would at least prevent some of the scenarios they\u2019ve been conjuring since Trump won the 2024 presidential race and nominated Gaetz.",
      "One Justice Department official said people are feeling better about Blanche because he\u2019s a legitimate lawyer and a former Justice Department official, but \u201cthat reflects the low expectations.\u201d",
      "Mimi Rocah, the district attorney for Westchester County, New York, said on MSNBC last week that she\u2019d worked with Blanche as a federal prosecutor in New York and that Blanche knows what the Justice Department is supposed to be and how it is meant to function.",
      "\u201cHe believes in the vision of the Department of Justice to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,\u201d Rocah said. \u201cAnd I do hope and believe that he knows that, and that he will continue that once he rises to the occasion in that role.\u201d",
      "A former colleague described Blanche as a smart and thorough attorney well-versed in the intricacies of the Justice Department, and the independent role it is meant to play. That person anticipated that Blanche would be a moderate relative to Gaetz, and despite his rapport with Trump would be unlikely to carry out an illegal order.",
      "Michael Bromwich, who previously served as the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, said Blanche would be taking on \u201cone of the hardest jobs in government\u201d with \u201cenormous\u201d management challenges, and that his position as the president\u2019s criminal defense attorney would complicate matters.",
      "\u201cNeedless to say, we\u2019ve never faced this circumstance before,\u201d Bromwich said. \u201cI think it\u2019s ethically problematic for Blanche. I think one of the reasons Trump selected him is that he\u2019s comfortable with Blanche, he communicates with him, and that they have a relationship in which Blanche does what Trump wants him to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an extraordinarily challenging job for Blanche,\u201d Bromwich added. \u201cI think the ethos and the culture that he was brought up in in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office is the antithesis of how Trump uses the criminal justice system, which is that it should do what he wants, rewards his friends and punishes his enemies.\u201d",
      "How Trump\u2019s first deputy attorney general fared",
      "When Trump first took office in 2017, he didn\u2019t know his deputy attorney general\u00a0well, and their relationship immediately became vital and volatile.",
      "Rod Rosenstein, a career federal prosecutor with\u00a0a reputation\u00a0for being nonpartisan,\u00a0chose FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u00a0recused himself from the bureau\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "The decision infuriated Trump, who berated Sessions and Rosenstein for it. For the next two years, though, Rosenstein defended Mueller and protected his team as it completed its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "Mueller found that Trump and his team welcomed help from Moscow during the 2016 election but did not find enough evidence to prosecute them for coordinating with Russia. Mueller reached no conclusion about whether Trump had obstructed justice. Rosenstein resigned from the DOJ in 2019.",
      "Rosenstein told NBC News this week that Blanche would face challenges. He said Trump was \u201cvery hands on\u201d and called him directly during his time in the DOJ\u2019s No. 2 position.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump often called the deputy attorney general, that is me, when he wanted something done, and sometimes we were able to do it, and sometimes we weren\u2019t,\u201d Rosenstein recalled.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that kind of relationship. I think the president obviously seems to want to put into senior jobs people who have been unfailingly loyal to him,\u201d Rosenstein added. \u201cIt\u2019s legal to do that. The risk is, if you prioritize loyalty over competence, you might not get accomplished what you wanted to accomplish.\u201d",
      "But Rosenstein said the deputy attorney general has a duty to prevent the president or White House officials from trying to improperly influence criminal investigations. He said the department\u2019s No. 2 official must \u201cmake sure things are implemented in a nonpartisan way\u201d in all criminal investigations. He added: \u201cSometimes that requires saying \u2018no\u2019 if the president or somebody in the White House wants to pursue a particular case that the department concludes is not appropriate to pursue.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not hypothetical, right? It\u2019s real under Trump,\u201d Rosenstein said.",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority in July gave the president\u00a0\u201cabsolute immunity\u201d when it comes to his interactions with the attorney general, including ordering criminal investigations of specific individuals. But that immunity does not extend to the attorney general, deputy attorney general or other DOJ prosecutors.",
      "\u201cFor the president to call for the prosecution of particular individuals is unusual, but it\u2019s not illegal,\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cHowever, it would be illegal for department officials to implement that kind of a request, and so you need to make sure to serve your appropriate role as an official of the Justice Department.\u201d",
      "Rosenstein added, \u201cThere are some things that the president may want that you can\u2019t do. You just have to tell him \u2018no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rosenstein said the deputy attorney general also needs to have the management experience and temperament to get things done.",
      "\u201cIt requires you to know how to manage the institution, not from a partisan perspective, right? You don\u2019t come in and say, \u2018Hey, we need to fire all the Democrats and hire all Republicans.\u2019\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cYou need people who actually know how to litigate, know how to put together and try cases. You can\u2019t send a politician into court to try to win a case. You need a lawyer. And so they need to make sure they have people who know how to get that job done.\u201d",
      "Blanche must also be able to withstand intense public scrutiny. Rosenstein said the media environment is far different than it was when he\u00a0joined the DOJ in 1990, when career officials \u2014 or even a deputy attorney general \u2014 had \u201cvery little chance of getting any national attention.\u201d",
      "Blanche could also be targeted on social media by the president himself if he stands up to him behind the scenes, as Trump has done to his own Justice Department appointees before.",
      "Bromwich, the former DOJ inspector general, predicted\u00a0that Blanche, given Trump\u2019s track record during his first term, is on a mission impossible.",
      "\u201cI think it will be enormously difficult for Blanche to balance the orders he gets from the president with what he knows is the right thing to do,\u201d Bromwich said. \u201cIf I were he, I would have stayed as far away from the Justice Department as I could. I don\u2019t think it will end well for him.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Congressional Republicans and former Trump appointees have spent the last year building out their response to the movement protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and now that Donald Trump is returning to the White House they warn that protest leaders, activists and those who help them raise money could face an onslaught of federal investigations and possible indictments.",
      "An NBC News review of congressional hearings and letters, along with lawsuits filed by organizations led by former Trump officials, provides a preview of which federal laws a second Trump administration could use when pursuing investigations and potential prosecutions.",
      "Judging from what has been pushed thus far, there are several legal measures most likely to be used once Trump returns to Washington. One would be deporting foreign college students in the U.S. on a visa after they\u2019re found to have openly advocated for Hamas or another U.S.-designated terror group, or after they participated in an unauthorized campus protest and were suspended, expelled or jailed.",
      "Another measure would be to pursue federal prosecutions of demonstrators who block synagogue entrances or disrupt Jewish speakers at events. A third approach is to charge protest leaders and nonprofits that aid in fundraising for protest groups with failing to register with the U.S. Justice Department as an \u201cagent of a foreign principal.\u201d And a fourth avenue is to open investigations into protest leaders who are in direct contact with U.S.-designated terror groups while advocating on their behalf.",
      "The multifaceted law enforcement approach is a marked departure from the Biden administration\u2019s response to the protest movement. Some of the nation\u2019s leading civil rights groups told NBC News that they are gearing up for a flood of legal battles to protect the protesters.",
      "\u201cTrying to predict what Trump will do is a fool\u2019s errand. We have to be prepared for the most extreme version of what he\u2019s threatened,\u201d said Ben Wizner, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s\u00a0Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. \u201cWe have to take him both literally and seriously.\u201d",
      "\u2018A new sheriff in town\u2019",
      "Biden administration officials have told NBC News that prosecuting speech-related crimes related to the anti-war protests is not a high priority for the current Justice Department, nor is seeking out student protesters on foreign visas a top concern for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will enforce the law,\u201d said Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, in an email to NBC News. Ernst recently asked the FBI to open an investigation into a pro-Hamas student group at Columbia University called Columbia University Apartheid Divest. A member had threatened \u201cZionists\u201d on social media, which the organization had initially distanced itself from after a strong public outcry but later supported in an Instagram post. CUAD also has handed out pro-Hamas flyers that circulated around campus featuring masked men holding weapons.",
      "\u201cThere is a new sheriff in town,\u201d Ernst said. The FBI has yet to respond to Ernst\u2019s request, her office said. An FBI spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Columbia University spokesperson said CUAD is not a recognized organization by the school and the flyers were under investigation. Members of CUAD declined to comment.",
      "Reed Rubinstein, who held high-ranking positions in both the Justice Department and the U.S. Education Department in the first Trump administration, is now a senior vice president at America First Legal, a public policy law firm in Washington, D.C., founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. (Miller is expected to return to the White House as a deputy chief of staff for policy.)",
      "Under Rubinstein, America First Legal has in the past year filed four lawsuits that provide a glimpse into how the Trump administration could differ from its predecessor. America First Legal alleges in the suits that the State Department, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education have protected pro-Hamas extremists.",
      "In court papers and in letters to several federal oversight officials, America First Legal has also said it believes the Justice Department should have forced several leaders of pro-Palestinian groups to report themselves under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA, which requires individuals acting as \u201can agent of a foreign principal\u201d to register themselves with the Justice Department.",
      "It has also accused the Department of Education of not following Title VI regulations,\u00a0which prohibits schools that accept federal funding from allowing on-campus discrimination based on race, shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics including being Jewish.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between lawful speech and unlawful conduct,\u201d Rubinstein told NBC News.\u00a0\u201cLaw enforcement has an obligation to act.\u201d",
      "Although the lawsuits haven\u2019t progressed in court, they provide a possible road map for how Trump-minded prosecutors could respond to the protest movement.",
      "So far, only the Education Department has responded to the allegations, court papers show, and said the agency doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to respond to the claims that policies aren\u2019t being enforced. The Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople at the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education all said they can\u2019t comment on pending litigation.",
      "Rubinstein in an interview brought up an additional law he expects a second Trump administration could enforce. Known as the FACE Act, the law prohibits people from using force, threats or intimidation while blocking entrances of places of worship. Earlier this month, protesters with SJP Chicago gathered at the Chicago Loop Synagogue to demonstrate against an Arab Israeli speaker who had served in the Israeli military. Videos posted to social media showed demonstrators blocking the synagogue\u2019s entrance, banging on the windows and getting inside.",
      "\u201cYou do not have the right to deny somebody the ability to congregate in a church or synagogue,\u201d Rubinstein said. \u201cWe would like to see the Department of Justice do its job.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the FBI\u2019s Chicago office said its policy is not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. The Chicago Police Department said it arrested two protesters and charged them with trespassing and one with property damage, both misdemeanor charges.",
      "SJP Chicago did not respond to a request for comment. But in an Instagram post, it said protesters were not being anti-Jewish. \u201cZionist have scrambled to throw together a narrative that these acts were anti-semetic and fueled by hate (what\u2019s new).\u201d",
      "An expected flood of legal battles",
      "Some of the nation\u2019s leading free speech and civil rights groups say they are gearing up to fight a new Trump administration and any attempts to go after protesters or their funders. Since 9/11, organizations including the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), along with the ACLU, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Knight First Amendment Institute have represented Muslim Americans and pro-Palestinian activists in cases involving free speech, surveillance or abuse.",
      "Edward Ahmed Mitchell, CAIR\u2019s deputy executive director, argued that the Biden administration failed to enforce FARA against leaders of pro-Israel groups. Mitchell said both Trump and President Joe Biden single out pro-Palestinian activists with either a lack of enforcement or with too much enforcement.",
      "\u201cJust as Americans who peacefully marched, protested and lobbied against segregation, the Vietnam War and South African apartheid were not deterred when government agencies spied upon, smeared, arrested and brutalized them,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cthe college students, human rights activists and everyday Americans peacefully opposing the Gaza genocide have not been deterred by such government abuses and, God willing, will not be deterred by such abuses in the future.\u201d",
      "Both CCR and the ACLU told NBC News that their concerns go beyond what the administration could do to crack down on just the protests. They pointed to the possibility that a Republican-led Congress could pass a bill currently under consideration that would strip away the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that a Trump appointed treasury secretary designates as providing material support to\u00a0\u201cterrorist supporting organizations.\u201d CCR also said it worries a second Trump administration could wrongly level accusations of failing to register as foreign agents against protest leaders and nonprofits that aid protest groups with collecting donations. CCR is also watching whether a Trump Justice Department will charge certain activists accused of supporting Hamas and other U.S.-designated terror organizations with violating a U.S. anti-terror law that prohibits advocating for terror groups while in coordination with them.",
      "\u201cWe are prepared for the Trump administration coming in and changing the game, particularly around the question, \u2018Where does speech fit into this?\u2019\u201d said Vince Warren, CCR\u2019s executive director.\u00a0 \u201cTo the extent that the Biden administration drew a line between speech and actionable conduct, we don\u2019t think that the Trump administration will do that at all.\u201d",
      "CCR is also concerned about the plans laid out in Project Esther, an initiative backed by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025.\u00a0Project Esther urges law enforcement to use a plethora of federal and state laws to dismantle what it terms the \u201cglobal Hamas Support Network\u201d using racketeering laws \u2014 used to break up the mafia \u2014 along with anti-terrorism and anti-hate speech laws.",
      "\u201cThey will throw any type of spaghetti up against the wall,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The Knight Institute said although it expects the new Trump administration to aggressively police speech, it is prepared to fight back. Earlier this month, Knight successfully rebuffed the Biden Treasury Department, which had blocked a New York based nonprofit from organizing an overseas conference with Hezbollah members, arguing it can\u2019t work with people sanctioned for ties to terrorism groups. The agency reversed course and settled the case earlier this month after Knight argued that an academic exchange of ideas could not violate anti-terror laws.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing the First Amendment protects, it\u2019s the right of Americans to criticize their own government\u2019s policies,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute\u2019s executive director.",
      "The ACLU\u2019s Wizner struck a similar note, saying: \u201cThe courts have made clear that the First Amendment protects all manner of controversial advocacy, including advocacy of violence, so long as the speaker isn\u2019t actively inciting imminent harm,\u201d Wizner said.",
      "Impact on college campuses",
      "Kenneth Marcus, who ran the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights during the Trump and George W. Bush administrations, now leads the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, one of the leading civil rights organizations focused on Jewish students. Over the past year, the center has sued a growing list of universities arguing officials failed to stop what it sees as widespread antisemitism on campus.",
      "Marcus said he has met with Department of Education officials requesting an expansion of civil rights enforcement to protect Jewish students on campuses. The Department of Education didn\u2019t respond to questions regarding Marcus\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cWe know that President Trump has repeatedly expressed concern about the campus situation,\u201d Marcus said.",
      "During the presidential campaign, one of the 20 promises in the preamble to the Republican Party platform was to \u201cdeport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported in August that the Biden administration said it was not targeting visa revocations for foreign students who may have engaged in speech-related offenses or participated in unauthorized campus protests\u00a0and had not terminated any university or college student visas due to protest activity related to the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to Washington could lead to possible attempts to revoke student visas for foreign students who openly support Hamas or other U.S.-designated terror organizations, Marcus said. Marcus also anticipates more intervention from the Justice Department when Jewish students say they are being targeted on campus.",
      "At a campaign stop in September, Trump said that at the start of his second presidency, he would inform universities that if they allow violence and threats against Jewish students, they \u201cwill be held accountable for violations of the civil rights law.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy administration will move swiftly to restore safety for Jewish students and Jewish people on American streets,\u201d Trump said."

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 Most have on jeans, some wear rough work boots, and one sings with a white construction helmet tucked under his arm. Gathered in the church hall before the altar, their song begins low and soft, surges and then sweeps through the Gothic-style church and up to its soaring stone ceiling.",
      "The 80-strong choir has come together to do more than sing, though \u2014 the crew of architects, stonemasons, archaeologists, art historians, art conservators and others have helped rebuild Paris\u2019 Notre-Dame cathedral after a fire ripped through the iconic French Gothic masterpiece nearly five years ago.",
      "With hundreds of people working to rebuild a structure so intimately tied to French art, history and culture, it felt natural to start a choir, said Stephanie Duch\u00eane, a conservation scientist and chemical engineer who helped form the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir, or Notre Dame Companions, nearly two years ago.",
      "Much like the building and rebuilding of a cathedral, a small army of individuals needs to work in unison to create extraordinary music.",
      "\u201cEveryone has to do his part to make the music sound good,\u201d said Duch\u00eane, the chief archaeologist and conservation scientist for the Laboratory of Research for Historical Monuments.",
      "Five years after the blaze that destroyed much of the cathedral\u2019s roof and brought down its iconic spire, long one of the city skyline\u2019s most recognizable sights, the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir is preparing to perform in the building they helped save. It will be part of a weekslong celebration marking the long-awaited reopening.",
      "On Dec. 11, the choir will perform a rendition of French composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCantique de Jean Racine,\u201d or \u201cChant by Jean Racine.\u201d",

      "Agnes Poirier, a French author who published the book \u200b\u200b\u201dNotre-Dame: The Soul of France,\u201d in the aftermath of the fire, echoes the pervasive feeling that the cathedral is much more than simply a building."

    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions will pit a teen phenom from India against a soft-spoken assassin from China \u2014 but it will be missing the GOAT from Norway.",
      "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China. And while it is still considered the game\u2019s marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, this should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

      "It\u2019s no secret that child care expenses have put a huge squeeze on households across the U.S., but the federal numbers show just how steep those costs became from one county to the next during the worst inflation in 40 years. On average, families spent anywhere from $6,552 to as much as $15,600 on full-day care per child in 2022, the latest year with available data.",
      "That upper range is a few hundred dollars more than that year\u2019s median annual rent, the agency noted. While incomes also range widely throughout the country, households typically funnel between about 9% and 16% of their annual income on day care per child.",
      "These costs are just untenable for an awful lot of families.",
      "Gretchen Livingston, U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau",
      "\u201cThese costs are just untenable for an awful lot of families,\u201d said Gretchen Livingston, the branch chief for quantitative research at the Labor Department\u2019s Women\u2019s Bureau, which conducted the study.",
      "The findings offer a snapshot of one of the biggest financial pressures Americans faced in the lead-up to the 2024 election, in which a driving factor was voters\u2019 price-fatigue hangover that even a sturdy economy can\u2019t seem to cure. But while child care costs help explain Americans\u2019 economic dissatisfaction, an NBC News analysis of the Labor Department and election result data also hints at the limits of the issue politically.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump expanded his vote share since 2020 in nearly 90% of counties nationwide, with the median vote shift among counties coming in at 3.2 percentage points, NBC News found. The most forbidding child care markets in 2022 voted two years later for Trump by higher margins than the nation overall, but so did many of the areas where child care was more affordable."

      "Reproductive rights groups are preparing for legal battles in several of the states where voters approved constitutional amendments to protect or expand abortion access this month.",
      "After seven of the 10 pro-abortion rights measures on the November ballot across the country passed, the groups that backed them are now working to ensure they are implemented smoothly, particularly in states where the amendments will undo existing abortion bans.",
      "Abortion rights groups are bracing for an especially tough fight in conservative Missouri, where they see one of the most restrictive bans in the country in place. Missouri banned almost all abortions after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with exceptions to protect the life of the mother and for medical emergencies.",

      "Anti-abortion groups and Republican lawmakers in Missouri challenged the measure\u2019s appearance on the ballot at every turn. As a result, despite the ballot measure\u2019s passage, there is no expectation that lawmakers will swiftly make changes to state statutes regarding abortion access.",
      "\u201cGoing to the courts is our fastest option, and also our most likely option to work in Missouri,\u201d she said.",
      "The ACLU of Missouri, together with a coalition of reproductive rights groups, has already filed litigation seeking to block the dozens of abortion restrictions on the books in the state \u2014 including the near-total ban \u2014 as part an effort to force implementation of the passed amendment.",
      "\u201cMissourians overwhelmingly voted to end Missouri\u2019s abortion ban and protect reproductive freedom. Our lawsuit is the next step to fulfill the promise of the amendment,\u201d Tori Schafer, the deputy director for policy and campaigns at the ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.",
      "The suit specifically asks the Missouri Supreme Court to declare the state\u2019s abortion ban unconstitutional and seeks the legal authorization for abortion providers in the state to resume services immediately. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 4, one day before the amendment would formally take effect.",
      "Several anti-abortion groups, including Missouri Stands with Women and the Thomas More Society, have indicated they\u2019ll fight implementation but haven\u2019t offered specific plans.",
      "Kelsey Pritchard, the director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America,\u00a0a national anti-abortion group that worked against the passage of amendments in Missouri and elsewhere, said in an email that the measure\u2019s \u201cslim margin of victory\u201d amounted to a \u201cclear indication that there will be pro-life victories in Missouri\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "Pritchard didn\u2019t provide any specifics about how the group might fight implementation of the measure in the state.",
      "Similar efforts appear imminent in Arizona, where passage of Proposition 139 created a \u201cfundamental right\u201d in the state\u2019s constitution to receive an abortion up until fetal viability,\u00a0with exceptions after that if a health care professional decides it\u2019s needed to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual.\u201d",
      "Officials will formally certify all statewide elections results Monday, opening the door for prospective litigation around its implementation.",
      "The passage of the ballot measure effectively undoes Arizona\u2019s current abortion law \u2014 which states that abortions are legal up until the 15th week of pregnancy, with an exception after that to save the woman\u2019s life but no exceptions for rape or incest \u2014 and contradicts what abortion rights groups say are approximately 40 other restrictions on care in state law.",
      "For the measure to be effectively carried out, these groups plan to quickly follow the Monday certification deadline with litigation they say is designed to prompt judges to overturn the dozens of existing abortion restrictions on the books in the state. They expect the process to take months.",
      "\u201cThe 40-plus laws that are still on the books don\u2019t automatically disappear,\u201d said Chris Love, a senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. \u201cThere will need to be legal challenges to most or all of those 40 laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Beyond the 15-week ban, the future of many of these abortion restrictions in the state may remain in question, despite the measure\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cThere are others where, potentially, an Arizona judge, likely appointed by one of our many Republican governors over the decades, would see it differently,\u201d said Dawn Penich, a spokesperson for the ballot measure campaign. She cited a 24-hour waiting period required for women to receive abortion care in the state as an example of the kind of law that may be allowed to stand.",
      "Despite the amendment\u2019s passage, securing access to abortion through fetal viability \u201cis not going to be easy and definitely not quick,\u201d she said.",
      "Anti-abortion groups haven\u2019t yet filed any litigation seeking to hamper forward movement of the measure\u2019s implementation in Arizona. At least one prominent anti-abortion organization has vowed to fight its implementation.",
      "\u201cWe hope to bring more alongside us in the next few weeks and months to continue this battle for life.\u00a0This fight is not over,\u201d Arizona Right to Life Chair Jill Norgaard said in a statement. Her group called on \u201cits allies in the fight against Proposition 139 to work together to overturn\u201d it in a statement this week.",
      "Pritchard, of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which also worked against passage of the measure in Arizona, didn\u2019t respond to questions about the group\u2019s future involvement around implementation in the state.",
      "Meanwhile, no litigation on either side of the issue has yet emerged in Montana, where voters passed a ballot measure enshrining abortion in the state constitution. But abortion rights groups in the heavily Republican state said they\u2019re prepared to respond to any.",
      "In Montana, abortion is already legal until fetal viability, meaning there is no need for a complicated legal process to unwind any major restrictions. That has meant that abortion rights groups haven\u2019t needed to file any affirmative litigation, and it significantly lowers the possibility of any viable challenges to the measure\u2019s implementation.",
      "Abortion rights groups also aren\u2019t expecting much of a battle in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada or New York \u2014 the remaining four states where voters passed measures enshrining abortion rights in state constitutions earlier this month.",
      "In Nevada, that\u2019s because voters will have to pass the same measure once again in 2026 for it to take effect (under state law, such amendments must pass in two consecutive election cycles).",
      "In Maryland and New York, abortions are already legal through fetal viability, while Colorado has no laws restricting abortion and no gestational limits for women seeking abortions. The constitutional amendments in these blue states serve almost entirely to prevent lawmakers from undoing existing protections in the future.",
      "Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota rejected proposed amendments that would have enshrined abortion protections in their state constitutions, the first states where pro-abortion-rights ballot measures failed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe.",
      "Reproductive rights groups said those outcomes make it clear that there remains significant opposition to abortion rights in many pockets across the country, and that they can\u2019t take anything for granted \u2014 including in states where such measures passed.",
      "\u201cBallot measures don\u2019t end on Election Day. Ballot measure coalitions have to stay engaged long after to ensure that the policies that they passed are implemented within the spirit that they are intended,\u201d said Quentin Savwoir, the director of programs and strategy at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works with progressive organizations to help advance citizen-led ballot measures.",
      "Savwoir added that his group expected to see an increase in actions and legislation that would make it harder for other states to put the future of abortion rights directly in the hands of voters.",
      "He predicted, for example, the emergence of bills in GOP-led states that mirror a Florida law that requires 60% support from voters to pass any such citizen-led ballot initiative. (The ballot measure that would have enshrined abortion rights in Florida\u2019s constitution failed, even though it received the support of 57% of voters.)",
      "\u201cWe are preparing for an escalation of all types of attacks on the ballot measure and initiative process itself, given the overwhelming support of our initiatives,\u201d he said."

      "The 27-year-old Red Bull driver just needed to finish ahead of his sole championship rival, McLaren's Lando Norris, to eliminate him from contention and secure the trophy with two races and a \"sprint\" to go in the 2024 season. He finished 5th, while Norris finished 6th.",
      "Verstappen becomes just the sixth driver in F1 history to capture four world championships, joining an elite club with Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, Alain Prost and Juan Manuel Fangio.",
      "\u201cOh my God, man. What a season,\u201d Verstappen said while still in his car over team radio. \u201cFour times! Thank you... It\u2019s been a little more difficult than last year, but we pulled through. And we gave it all.\u201d",
      "With actor and filmmaker Sylvester Stallone waving the checkered flag, Mercedes driver George Russell won the 50-lap race after qualifying in pole position, ahead of Mercedes teammate Hamilton in 2nd place and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz in 3rd.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of incredible young talent in the sport and Lando is definitely one of them. And of course, at times, he made it very difficult for me,\u201d Verstappen said\u00a0at a post-race news conference.",
      "Norris congratulated Verstappen after the race, saying he made the most of his opportunities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the strength of his,\u201d Norris told reporters. \u201cHe has no negatives. When he had the quickest car, he dominated races. When he\u2019s not the quickest car, he\u2019s still just behind us and almost winning the races anyway\u2026 He just gets everything out of the car every time.\u201d",
      "The international sport has brought a new level of glitz and glamor \u2014 and a title-decider \u2014 to Las Vegas. Celebrities made appearances in the paddock, with some attendees dropping tens of thousands of dollars for premium trackside tickets in hospitality suites.",
      "\u201cI love fast cars, I love racing and I love Las Vegas,\u201d Paris Hilton, a fan of McLaren and Norris, told NBC News on the grid moments before the race started. \u201cSo it\u2019s a perfect combination of fun.\u201d",
      "The track is best-known for its 1.2 mile-long straight along the famous Las Vegas Boulevard, where the cars reached a top speed of about 221 mph as they zipped by the Venetian, the Bellagio and other casinos on the Strip, while providing a series of exciting overtakes for the fans in attendance.",
      "Verstappen played it safe and took few risks, putting up little defense as the two rapid Ferraris of Sainz and Charles Leclerc challenged and ultimately overtook him. Neither of the Ferrari or Mercedes drivers were mathematically in the title hunt.",
      "Ahead of the race, Norris told reporters that the title was all but out of reach regardless of what happened in Vegas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change anything. He\u2019s pretty likely to win the championship,\u201d Norris said late Friday after qualifying. \u201cBut I\u2019m here to race and do my best in every single race I can, whether Max finishes ahead or not. That\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "The constructors championship, which pays out the lucrative prize money in F1, is still up for grabs. McLaren leads in the standings, ahead of Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes.",
      "Red Bull won the constructors championship in 2022 and 2023, but it is unlikely to repeat that feat this year, largely due to the persistent struggles and weaker performance of its second driver, Sergio Perez, who has had a winless season.",
      "A new American team in F1?",
      "The Las Vegas Grand Prix capped three races in the United States \u2014 including Miami and Austin \u2014 in the 2024 season, more than any other country, a vote of confidence in the growing American market. It was the second race of the 10-year contract in Vegas.",
      "Aside from the road closures and inconveniences for many locals, the race has been a boon to Las Vegas. A report by Nevada\u2019s Clark County said the economic impact of the race was nearly $1.5 billion. Race attendance last year was 316,000, the report added.",
      "And U.S. interest could soon get another boost.",
      "Insiders expect Formula 1 to admit an 11th team on the grid, likely called Cadillac F1, in 2026, sources with knowledge told NBC News.",
      "The anticipated move is linked to an earlier bid by Andretti and GM-backed Cadillac that was green-lit by the sport's governing body, the FIA, but rejected by F1's commercial side. The shift comes amid a commitment from Cadillac to build its own power unit starting in 2028, and changes in the Andretti organization that have put investor Daniel Towriss (rather than Michael Andretti) at the helm of the bid. The news was first reported by the Associated Press.",
      "A spokesperson for Formula 1 declined to comment. The sport's commercial owner, Liberty Media, is facing an investigation by the Department of Justice for potential antitrust violations after denying the earlier bid by Andretti, the company told investors in August.",
      "If approved, the decision would put a famous American team and car manufacturer in the pinnacle of motorsport. It would occur in the same year that Red Bull is set to partner with Ford to build its power unit, setting up a clash of U.S. car giants.",
      "Verstappen\u2019s triumph wasn\u2019t a sure thing",
      "For all his successes, it's been a turbulent season for Verstappen as he has navigated car problems, formidable rivals and seemingly nonstop drama surrounding him off the track.",
      "After winning seven out of the first 10 races, Verstappen has won just one of the last 12 races. The early string of victories have been crucial in Verstappen\u2019s quest for a fourth world championship.",
      "It came after Verstappen had a record-smashing season in 2023, winning 19 of the 22 races during the season. The dominance of his Red Bull car continued into the early part of the 2024 season, but rapidly tapered off as McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes improved their cars and challenged for victories.",
      "Verstappen's campaign was also helped by the fact that multiple rival teams caught up \u2014 if not surpassed Red Bull \u2014 around the same time. The season has seen a total of seven race-winners: including the six drivers with McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes. In numerous cases where Verstappen struggled, others took points off Norris and hindered his quest to challenge the Dutchman."

      "It was a chemical reaction that sparked the massive fire and toxic smoke plume at a lab in Georgia that threatened nearby communities and metropolitan Atlanta in September, according to the findings released by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB).",
      "The board released its findings Friday following an investigation into the Sept. 29 chemical fire at a BioLab plant in Conyers, Georgia.",
      "The safety board said the main substances involved were a collection of chemicals that are commonly used for cleaning and disinfecting: bromochloro-5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (BCDMH), trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (DCCA). The chemicals were stored in the plant\u2019s warehouse and generated heat, eventually leading to their breakdown and resulting in the release of toxic vapors and fires, the CSB said in its report.",
      "\u201cThe resulting massive plumes of toxic smoke contained chlorine and other hazardous substances and caused significant offsite impacts,\u201d the CSB said.",
      "Operator KIK Consumer Products runs the BioLab facility in Conyers, which makes Clorox-branded pool-cleaning products made with chlorine.",
      "The CSB said the incident began at around 5 a.m., when a BioLab employee on fire watch heard \u201ca popping sound\u201d in one of the warehouses. Eventually, the employee called 911 because \u201clarge hazardous plumes of toxic vapors\u201d had been released inside the warehouse.",
      "\u201cBy 6:30 a.m., flames became visible above the area of the chemical reaction and were quickly extinguished in less than two hours,\u201d the CSB said, adding that another, larger fire broke out shortly before 12:30 p.m. and was eventually extinguished at around 4 p.m. The fires completely destroyed that warehouse, known as plant 12.",
      "It was then that emergency responders began evacuating the area, according to the CSB. Around 17,000 people in the nearby community were evacuated and more than 90,000 people in the metropolitan Atlanta area were told to shelter in place. The last shelter-in-place warning regarding the incident was issued on the evening of Oct. 16 and expired the following day.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency found elevated chlorine and hydrogen chloride levels during air monitoring it conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2, the CSB said. The agency continued monitoring the air until Oct. 17, when it detected low chlorine levels at 11 monitoring stations around the site of the incident.",
      "CSB Chairperson Steve Owens said the incident and the risk it brought to Rockdale County were \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cReactive chemical incidents can have severe environmental and public safety impacts due to the combination of fire, toxic gas emissions, and hazardous materials involved, and Bio-Lab and any other facility that has reactive chemicals onsite must manage those materials safely,\u201d Owens said in a statement.",
      "The CSB\u2019s investigation into the incident is ongoing, as it continues to look into the cause of the chemical\u2019s decomposition, the storage and handling of the chemicals, as well as industry guidance for fire safety concerning such chemicals.",

      "Secure 2.0 has also\u00a0boosted access\u00a0to 401(k) and 403(b) plans for certain part-time workers.",
      "Starting in 2024, employers were required to extend plan access to part-time employees who worked at least 500 hours annually for three consecutive years. That threshold drops to two consecutive years in 2025.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing for long-term part-time workers\u201d who may have struggled to qualify for 401(k) eligibility, said Stinnett.",
      "In March 2023, some 73% of civilian workers had\u00a0access to workplace\u00a0retirement benefits, and 56% of workers participated in these plans, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cCoverage is my thing,\u201d said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that people have coverage no matter where they go,\u201d including from full-time to part-time at the same job, she added.",
      "Mandatory auto-enrollment for new 401(k) plans",
      "Another Secure 2.0 change is auto-enrollment for certain 401(k) plans.",
      "Starting in 2025, most 401(k) and 403(b) plans established after Dec. 28, 2022, must include automatic enrollment of eligible employees in the plan with a minimum 3% employee deferral rate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unequivocally a positive step to take,\u201d Munnell said. \u201cMore people will join, and more people will have savings because of that.\u201d",
      "Automatic enrollment and escalation \u2014 gradually increasing the contribution rate annually \u2014 are key plan designs to boost savings, Stinnett\u00a0previously told CNBC.",
      "But those features still may not result in employees saving enough. While experts recommend a 15% savings rate, most plans\u00a0set a cap on automatic escalation. In 2022, 63% limited automated contributions to 10% or less of annual pay, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America."

      "\u201cI think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean-spirited, but really an attempt to misdirect,\u201d McBride told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cEvery single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cIt is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time, every single time we hear them say the word \u2018trans,\u2019 look what they\u2019re doing with their right hand. Look at what they\u2019re doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors by privatizing Social Security and Medicare,\u201d McBride added.",
      "In a separate interview Sunday, she also characterized the ongoing Republican moves to restrict where she can use the bathroom on Capitol Hill \u201ca lot of noise.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the last two years, over the last two weeks, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of noise around me, but I\u2019ve remained focused,\u201d McBride told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t run for her seat, where she\u2019ll begin serving as a first-term congresswoman in January, to make waves.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t run to be a first. I didn\u2019t run to make history. I ran to serve this state that I love and to deliver for Delawareans,\u201d McBride said.",
      "Her comments come as Republicans have ramped up attacks against her in the last two weeks, with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., sponsoring a resolution that would prohibit House members and staff from \u201cusing single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.\u201d",
      "Shortly after introducing the resolution, Mace made clear that the measure was \u201cabsolutely\u201d targeting McBride.",

      "He added that \u201ceach Member office has its own private restroom, and unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Mace doubled down on her anti-trans rhetoric, telling Fox News, \u201cSo many women now today feel more brave and have more courage because I\u2019ve been speaking out. They feel like they\u2019re going to be supported.\u201d",
      "In the wake of Mace and Johnson\u2019s statements, Democrats in both chambers of Congress have backed McBride, condemning Republicans for targeting her.",

Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., blasted Mace as \u201cdisgusting and wrong,\u201d telling CNN: \u201cWe have issues here in this country, and yet she\u2019s worried about one member of Congress using the bathroom. Number one, I think her position is disgusting and wrong, but I also think that we have a lot more to worry about than where somebody goes to pee.\u201d",
      "During Thursday\u2019s White House press briefing, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that President Joe Biden is \u201cvery proud of\u201d McBride and added: \u201cWhat [McBride] said is, \u2018I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families.\u2019 And we agree with her.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis incoming small House Republican Conference majority is beginning to transition to the new Congress by bullying a member of Congress,\u201d Jeffries told reporters.",

This is your priority, that you want to bully a member of Congress, as opposed to welcoming her to join this body so all of us can work together to get things done and deliver real results for the American people.\u201d"

      "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a summons to Indian billionaire\u00a0Gautam Adani,\u00a0indicted\u00a0on U.S. bribery allegations related to a bombshell federal indictment against him, a court filing showed.",
      "The SEC is suing the head of the Adani Group and his nephew\u00a0Sagar Adani,\u00a0alleging they engaged in hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to help an Adani company while \u201cfalsely touting the company\u2019s compliance with antibribery principles and laws in connection with a $750 million bond offering.\u201d",
      "The summons requires an answer within 21 days, according to the filing dated Wednesday in federal court in the Eastern District of New York. The SEC suit seeks unspecified monetary penalties and restrictions on the Adanis from serving as officers of listed companies.",

      "The group has denied the criminal charges as \u201cbaseless\u201d. The group\u00a0CFO said\u00a0the indictment is linked to one contract of Adani Green Energy that makes up some 10% of its business, and that no other firms in the conglomerate were accused of wrongdoing.",

      "Air travelers face a host of headaches on their journeys: slow security lines, long\u00a0waits\u00a0for plush\u00a0lounges, the threat of\u00a0delays\u00a0or cancellations \u2014 and the airport\u00a0Starbucks.",
      "Many travelers, flight crews and even airport employees have at some point encountered long wait times for their Starbucks cappuccinos, cold brews and egg bites.",
      "\u201cThey need to have a better system,\u201d said Coresa Barrino, a Starbucks patron at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport Terminal B earlier this month who said she had been waiting 10 minutes and counting for her coffee. The nursing assistant, who was taking a flight back to Charlotte, North Carolina, said the wait when she buys her coffee at a Starbucks in Charlotte is about two minutes.",
      "The long waits have caught the attention of the coffee chain\u2019s new CEO,\u00a0Brian Niccol, who\u00a0joined\u00a0Starbucks from\u00a0Chipotle\u00a0in September, pledging to\u00a0win back customers\u00a0and reverse the company\u2019s sales slump.",
      "Niccol told investors he thinks that licensed locations, such as those inside\u00a0Target\u00a0stores or airports, are interested in following the company\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0of \u201cgetting back to Starbucks.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I think about the airports and such, there\u2019s such a huge opportunity for us to simplify some of the execution there so that we get people the great throughput that they want so they can get on their way,\u201d Niccol said on the company\u2019s quarterly conference call Oct. 30.",
      "Starbucks\u2019 airport location staff \u2014 and company technology \u2014 will be put to the test this week during some of the busiest travel days of the year. The Transportation Security Administration forecast a record number of travelers during Thanksgiving week and said Sunday, Dec. 1, could be the busiest day of the year, with more than 3 million people screened at U.S. airports.",
      "The surge in air travel, especially during peak times such as Thanksgiving, has led to congestion in airport security lines, in lounges and at\u00a0gates\u00a0\u2014 problems that airlines and the federal\u00a0government\u00a0are trying to\u00a0fix. For the aviation industry, bottlenecks at airport Starbucks are just another sign of soaring demand and overcrowded airports.",
      "A record 1.05 billion people boarded airplanes going either to, from or between U.S. airports in 2023, narrowly topping the total in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "Struggles and fresh approaches",
      "Starbucks has recently struggled. Its\u00a0sales fell\u00a0for the third straight quarter in the period ended Sept. 30, as consumers pushed back against higher prices and ignored initiatives such as discounts and energy drinks aimed at bringing customers back. Same-store sales in the U.S. declined by 6% from a year earlier.",
      "In late October, Niccol unveiled plans aimed at improving customers\u2019 experiences and reviving the company\u2019s sales, from bringing back condiment bars, to eliminating surcharges for\u00a0dairy alternatives\u00a0and cutting down the menu.",
      "Cutting wait time is a key goal: He wants to trim service times down to four minutes, which would shrink long lines and improve the customer experience.",
      "And while Starbucks started rolling out mobile order and pay to its airport locations in 2022, the change can sometimes add to the confusion and chaos at the cafe counter instead of resolving it. Plus, some travelers might not be regular Starbucks customers who already have the app downloaded.",
      "Improving the coffee chain\u2019s airport outposts could boost both sales and the brand\u2019s reputation during a time when it needs it most. Even the customers Starbucks has lost might visit an airport location while they\u2019re traveling.",
      "With travelers returning in\u00a0droves\u00a0after the pandemic, it gives Starbucks and other restaurant chains a chance to boost sales.",
      "Concessions contribute about 4% of U.S. airport revenue annually, according to the latest available Federal Aviation Administration\u00a0data, but they\u2019re an important feature to many passengers, who have limited time \u2014 and, often, energy \u2014 to fuel up before a flight.",
      "At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, revenue from food and beverage outlets is growing faster than passenger numbers, said Jennifer Simkins, the airport\u2019s assistant vice president of concessions. The airport has become the world\u2019s third-busiest for passengers, up from 10th place in 2019, according to Airports Council International.",
      "Airlines are also packing more seats on their aircraft and in some cases are\u00a0flying larger jets.",
      "More passengers per plane means restaurants can become crowded during peak times with more customers waiting to be served and space limited, said Ursula Cassinerio, an assistant vice president at Moody\u2019s Ratings who covers airports.",
      "She noted that many airports have been undergoing major renovations, if not building new terminals. That means \u201cmore opportunities for revenue if you have more square footage for retail and restaurants,\u201d she said.",
      "The 25 busiest airports in the U.S. have an average of 80 food and beverage brands as options for travelers, according to data from market research firm Technomic.",
      "Licensing model",
      "A challenge for Starbucks is that licensees \u2014 not Starbucks itself \u2014 operate its airport locations.",
      "Starbucks opened its first airport location with licensee HMSHost in 1991 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which serves Starbucks\u2019 hometown.",
      "For nearly three decades, HMSHost operated the chain\u2019s airport locations through an exclusive deal with Starbucks and gradually grew its airport footprint to roughly 400 outposts.",
      "But in 2020, HMSHost ended the deal, giving the operator flexibility to offer more coffee options to airports.",
      "While HMSHost still operates the overwhelming majority of Starbucks\u2019 airport cafes, more operators, such as Paradies Lagardere and OTG, have since taken a swing at it.",
      "HMSHost, Paradies Lagardere and OTG did not respond to requests for comment for this story.",
      "\u201cAirport locations are tricky because they can make good money, but operationally, at times, they can be very challenging,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst and CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.",
      "Licensing its stores saves Starbucks the hassles of operating inside an airport, such as staffing problems, high rents and security checkpoints. And though the coffee chain is used to handling a surge of undercaffeinated customers in the mornings, the swell in demand at an airport can be even more erratic.",
      "\u201cA plane lands, and all of a sudden there\u2019s a hundred people when there were zero people there before,\u201d said Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research for Technomic.",
      "The trade-off is that Starbucks makes less money from those licensed restaurants.",
      "The company has more than 16,300 locations in the U.S. as of Sept. 24. But it only runs about 60% of those cafes itself; licensees operate the rest. That number includes its cafes in 47 of the 50 busiest airports in the U.S., according to Starbucks. The company did not disclose its current airport store count to CNBC.",
      "In fiscal 2024, licensed locations accounted for 12% of Starbucks\u2019 revenue, or $4.51 billion. From those stores, Starbucks collects only licensing fees, a percentage of monthly sales through royalties, and payments for supplying its coffee, tea and food to licensees, according to company filings.",
      "For every dollar spent in a licensed store, Starbucks generates about 7 cents of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to estimates from Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore. Company-owned stores make about 23 cents per dollar spent, Senatore wrote in a research note in September.",
      "If its business partners and third-party providers slack off, Starbucks\u2019 brand could be damaged, the company noted in the risk factors section of its latest annual filing.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of customers, they don\u2019t know whether that is a company-owned Starbucks or a licensed Starbucks,\u201d Kalinowski said. \u201cThey just want their Starbucks. They want it made properly. They want it quickly. And they\u2019re in a situation of heightened stress because they\u2019re trying to get to their gate.\u201d",
      "Airports themselves have been adopting more technology in their restaurants to help move lines along.",
      "Labor challenges have led to more kiosks and tablets inside airport restaurants, for example.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s harder and harder to staff a lot of these restaurants, so any front-of-house savings that you can make by having consumers order on kiosks or tablets or whatever, that really, really helps,\u201d Schimpf said.",
      "Laurie Noyes, vice president of concessions and commercial parking at Tampa International Airport, said that \u201csometimes the airports are a little bit behind the street.\u201d But she said the airport has made strides in offering more digital options and now, travelers can order food ahead of time via\u00a0Uber\u00a0Eats, and pick it up at airport restaurants.",
      "Dallas Fort Worth offers DFWOrderNow, a website and platform available at digital kiosks so travelers can order food ahead. Simkins said the airport\u2019s platform will reroute Starbucks customers to Starbucks\u2019 own platform. Starbucks offers more than 170,000 possible drink orders, according to the chain\u2019s website. \u201cWe just found the value in keeping the familiarity for their customers,\u201d Simkins said.",
      "Simkins said the airport is developing robotic technology for delivery to speed up service. It\u2019s also experimenting with offering meal and retail bundles from airport restaurants and shops, she said, so passengers \u201cno longer have to plan their route for multiple stops\u201d in an airport.",
      "A local coffee company, Fort Worth, Texas-based Ampersand, plans to open a robotic barista at DFW\u2019s Terminal C, Simkins said. It will be available 24/7, to accommodate flight crews arriving at off-hours.",
      "Simkins said popular chains still draw a crowd.",
      "\u201cThere are some brands that people will line up for,\u201d she said.",
      "For Barrino, who was waiting for her coffee at LaGuardia, Starbucks is one of those companies.",
      "\u201cI just really love the brand,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cFirst and foremost, the people involved with this should be fired immediately,\u201d Schmitt said in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",

      "His remarks come as special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting two cases against Trump \u2014 one related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and one related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office in 2021 \u2014 plans to wind down the cases against Trump and resign before he takes office.",
      "In the week after Trump was projected to win the election, Smith asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to hit pause on the 2020 election case. Chutkan granted the motion shortly after the request was filed.",
      "Schmitt framed his call to fire anyone who worked on these cases as a form of \u201caccountability,\u201d telling moderator Kristen Welker, \u201c[The cases] all fell apart under the weight of the law. And so I do think there needs to be accountability. I think that getting it back to crime-fighting is important, but there has to be accountability for these kinds of abuses.\u201d",
      "Trump repeatedly attacked the Justice Department while campaigning this year and detailed what he would expect from the department if elected.",
      "Trump has often said he would pardon the more than 1,000 supporters who have been charged with crimes related to storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "On the campaign trail, he also indicated that he would use the Justice Department to target his political opponents, including Smith.",
      "On his social media site Truth Social, Trump once reposted a photo of Smith with the words, \u201cHe should be prosecuted for election interference & prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d",
      "And after a September campaign rally, Trump wrote in a post, \u201cWHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences. Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials.\u201d",
      "Schmitt also said he would back former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom Trump said he would nominate for attorney general after his previous pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew himself from consideration.",
      "\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d Schmitt said when asked whether he\u2019d vote to confirm Bondi.",
      "He added, \u201cI intend to to help Pam Bondi get the votes. I know her well. She\u2019s a friend. I\u2019ve come to respect Pam Bondi. She was a great attorney general in Florida. This is a home run by President Trump.\u201d",
      "In an interview with CNN Sunday, Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Trump would pressure Bondi to go after his political adversaries.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we know one way or the other,\u201d Lankford said.",
      "He added, \u201cEvery single U.S. attorney around the country works for them and with them. So, it is very important that we get this role right, and that they\u2019re actually focused on diminishing crime in America and making sure we\u2019re getting good prosecutions.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s no secret that child care expenses have put a huge squeeze on households across the U.S., but the federal numbers show just how steep those costs became from one county to the next during the worst inflation in 40 years. On average, families spent anywhere from $6,552 to as much as $15,600 on full-day care per child in 2022, the latest year with available data.",
      "That upper range is a few hundred dollars more than that year\u2019s median annual rent, the agency noted. While incomes also range widely throughout the country, households typically funnel between about 9% and 16% of their annual income on day care per child.",
      "These costs are just untenable for an awful lot of families.",
      "Gretchen Livingston, U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau",
      "\u201cThese costs are just untenable for an awful lot of families,\u201d said Gretchen Livingston, the branch chief for quantitative research at the Labor Department\u2019s Women\u2019s Bureau, which conducted the study.",
      "The findings offer a snapshot of one of the biggest financial pressures Americans faced in the lead-up to the 2024 election, in which a driving factor was voters\u2019 price-fatigue hangover that even a sturdy economy can\u2019t seem to cure. But while child care costs help explain Americans\u2019 economic dissatisfaction, an NBC News analysis of the Labor Department and election result data also hints at the limits of the issue politically.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump expanded his vote share since 2020 in nearly 90% of counties nationwide, with the median vote shift among counties coming in at 3.2 percentage points, NBC News found. The most forbidding child care markets in 2022 voted two years later for Trump by higher margins than the nation overall, but so did many of the areas where child care was more affordable."

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 19:43:00 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Gladiator II\" starring Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen, Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal is finally out, but getting mixed reviews. See how fans are reacting.",
    "story": [
      "\"Gladiator II\" has finally hit theaters and it's leaving some fans up in arms about its shaky plotline.",
      "Helmed by \"Gladiator\" director Ridley Scott,\u00a0the movie stars Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen, Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal and is a follow up to the first \"Gladiator\" film that came out in 2000. The sequel follows Mescal's character, Lucius, who becomes a gladiator after he is taken prisoner and forced to work into the Colosseum.",
      "While winning battles for Macrinus (Washington), a well-connected Roman businessman, Lucius learns his family's history and is inspired to help Rome return to its former glory.",
      "The film was released on Friday, Nov. 22, and has a total run time of 2 hours and 28 minutes. According to Variety, \"Gladiator II\" has a projected domestic opening weekend of $60 million and opened with a \"powerful\" debut of $87 million in the international box office arena, making it the biggest international R-rated opening weekend for Paramount Pictures.",
      "While the box office stats appear to be doing well for the sequel to the Oscar-winning film, on social media fans had mixed reactions.",
      "Some applauded the film, calling it \"excellent\" and \"soooo good.\"",
      "Others were a bit more dramatic with one writing, \u201cJust watched gladiator 2 and suddenly life is worth living again.\u201d",
      "Another shared they were in tears over the film.",
      "While some felt the new film was a great follow up to the first, others on X felt differently. Some noted that \"Gladiator II\" just couldn't compare to the first movie.",
      "\"If you love Gladiator 1, Don\u2019t watch Gladiator 2,\" a fan wrote.",
      "Another added their analysis: \"While Gladiator 2 is not bad at all, it suffers from a comparison to that masterpiece that Scott directed in 2000. The first Gladiator was pure Cinema from start to finish, where the fantastic performances and visuals were complimented by an heartfelt story and a glorious score.\"",
      "A third shared their thoughts, calling \"Gladiator\" a \"MASTERPIECE,\" but  \"Gladiator II\" a \"sword-and-sandals action flick you\u2019ll forget about next week.\"",
      "A few questioned the film's plot with one calling the film \"unnecessary\" with a \"forced script that didn\u2019t add to the story in any meaningful way.\"",
      "Another added that they hated the lazy \"plot points\" of the film.",
      "One even joked that the film's plot had nothing to with Lucius storyline, sharing a meme that read, \"Me; \u201cI\u2019m watching Gladiator 2 for the plot,\u201d before adding a shirtless photo of Paul Mescal next to a photo of Pedro Pascal with the headline, \"The plot;\"",
      "Though the social media reactions to \"Gladiator II\" varied online, there seemed to be an overwhelming consensus about one thing: Denzel Washington made it worth the watch.",
      "\"GLADIATOR II is okay. Mescal is fine, as is everyone else,\" one person tweeted before adding, \"The real star, as you\u2019ve probably heard, is Denzel Washington, delivering one of his most magnetic performances. His contagious, electrifying presence goes a long way in elevating a painfully by-the-numbers movie.\"",
      "Another person predicted that Washington would get an Oscar nod for his performance.",
      "\"Not going to lie I can\u2019t stop thinking of Denzel\u2019s performance in Gladiator 2. He has an Oscar with his name written on it,\" the person wrote in part.",
      "Others had similar sentiments about Washington's performance, with one even joking that the Oscar winner carried the entire film."

      "But then the most shocking single moment was \u2014 there's a giant sculpted face of Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard that I'm sure you know what I'm talking about in the movie. And Ari (Ariana Grande) and I were just walking around set one day, just like having a little walk about, and then we just popped up on it, and it really gave us a jump scare. But it\u2019s just because he\u2019s so striking and handsome, of course.",

      "We would have wine nights after shoots, especially when we were shooting remotely out in the countryside. The Shiz campus was like, all the way outside of London. And so they put us up in this place where we would just like, have a little night cap. And it was just a really tasteful adult thing. And then we would all go to bed and show up to work the next morning. It just felt like an adult summer camp.",
      "I\u2019ve been obsessed with it. Cynthia (Erivo) and I have the same thing where we didn\u2019t see it until much later in our lives, but we knew the songs and the story, obviously... If you were in a drama club in the aughts, it was just the thing, like you lived and breathed it.",
      "I just remember going to the library and renting out the original Broadway cast recording and flipping through the booklet \u2014 remember those? And just seeing pictures of Idina (Menzel, the original Elphaba) and Kristin (Chenoweth, the original Glinda). I was like, something has changed within me. I was like, this is the best, this is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.",
      "Pfannee's vibe. There's a moment where Pfannee and Shenshen run up to Galinda when she gets off the boat at Shiz that you might see in an extended version of the film. But they are just there to rekindle this friendship with Galinda that they've had since they were kids.",
      "That's background, that's not totally necessary, but I think, what's really interesting about them as characters is that they see and they operate on status. They see Galinda, and they're like, she's someone that we can, like, glom onto.",
      "We talked about them early on and Jon (M. Chu) was like, \"I don't think these are the lackeys, or like the snickering best friends. I think there's something more to them.\" And we were like, \"Yeah, what is it?\" I think what we landed on was that they are kind of Galinda's publicists.",
      "Ari was very protective of Galinda not being the one to enact the bullying, she\u2019s good. And so it falls on these two characters to be the nefarious ones. We\u2019re the ones who give her the hat and are like, \u2018You know who should wear this? Elphaba.\u2019\u201d",

      "Oh yeah, we're so excited. This is the perfect time of year to do a double feature. You've totally got nothing but time, hopefully.",
      "I think \u201cGladiator II\u201d is going to be slightly more intense, maybe more of an emotional drain, perhaps. It\u2019s going to be very, I think, quite violent.",
      "And I think our movie is a cute salve to put over that wound. Yeah, maybe watch \u201cWicked\u201d after \u201cGladiator.\u201d",
      "The rules of Ozian culture are: The train to the Emerald City is too small. That's rule of culture No. 7.",

      "And rule of Ozian culture No. 4 is Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) is unfortunately a style icon, even though she's a villain.",
      "Look, everyone\u2019s like, \u2018This is the longest intermission ever.\u2019 It needs to be that because a lot of time passes between the acts.",
      "A lot happens right when we pick up. Galinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen are at her side still, but a lot is in motion. The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like, the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "The story is so flexible how it relates to our real world, but I think, it's going to be interesting to see it \u2014",
      "(Editor\u2019s note: Paul Mescal, star of \u201cGladiator II,\u201d stopped to say hello to Yang in the TODAY green room.)",
      "And a lot has shifted in the topography of things. But yeah it needs that, because if you go straight from \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d to what happens in Act 2, it just feels like too much of a lurch."

(For a bit of \u201cWicked\u201d history, both Menzel and Chenoweth were nominated for best performance by a leading actress in a musical at the 2004 Tonys, which Menzel won.)",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful moment where Ariana is about to hit a high note, and Kristin puts her hand over her mouth,\u201d Schwartz adds.",

      "After being captured, Lucius and several other prisoners are sent into the Colosseum where they are forced to fend off a pack of feral baboons \u2014 or die.",
      "\u201cThat sequence is absolutely insane, almost unfathomable when you see it,\u201d Mescal said, according to the film\u2019s press notes. \u201cHe is taken prisoner and dragged into Rome. He has an intense anger towards everything Roman that will grow as the film progresses.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen he enters the arena for the first time, he sees Acacius, the\u00a0 general who led the siege of his city and was responsible for killing his wife. He sees him sitting there with his\u00a0own wife and he vows to himself to kill them or be killed,\u201d Mescal continues.",
      "Lucius soon realizes the heavy implication of that vow. Acacius' wife, played by Connie Nielsen, is his mother \u2014 and no one appears to remember his true identity.",

He doesn\u2019t want to be the emperor. He wants to control the emperor,\u201d Washington said, according to the press notes.",
      "\u201cAnd power is an addictive drug. Once you have it, you can\u2019t live without it. Once he had a taste for taking, he had to have more. He doesn\u2019t really care about anyone. He uses them. If people can\u2019t make him more powerful, he has no interest in them,\u201d he added.",

So, then he\u2019s a good guy. And the movie plays those tricks on us continually.\u201d",
      "Acacius attempts to take over the government from the twin emperors, but Macrinus learns of his plan through his connections throughout the empire and thwarts it.",

      "The death of Acacius destabilizes the emperors\u2019 reign, which Macrinus capitalizes on. He begins plotting to turn the twin brothers against each other, and focuses on Caracalla\u2019s insecurity as the weaker leader. He convinces him to kill his own brother, and during the murder, Macrinus even helps him cut off Geta\u2019s head.",
      "An obvious nod to his instability, Caracalla appoints his pet monkey as first consul, but appoints Macrinus as his second consul, giving the businessman sweeping authority over the empire.",
      "Meanwhile, Lucius hears that his mother is set to be executed for her role in the attempted coup and decides to finally accept his destiny as a leader in Rome.",
      "He sends a messenger (along with a ring belonging to his father given to him by Lucilla) to a group of Acacius\u2019 soldiers gathered outside of Rome. His plan? To rally his fellow gladiators to try to stop his mother\u2019s execution and use the Acacius' soldiers to take back the city.",
      "As Lucilla is brought out into the Colosseum\u00a0to be executed, the gladiators overpower the guards, but not before Macrinus manages to shoot Lucilla in the chest with an arrow. He then rides out of the Colosseum to gather his own army to fight against the Acacius\u2019 soldiers.",
      "Lucius chases him, and the pair face off in an epic battle on the outskirts of town with their two armies watching. Lucius wins the battle, cutting off Macrinus' arm and killing him in a river. He then gives an inspiring speech to the soldiers about rebuilding Rome, just as his father Maximus would have wanted.",
      "In the film's final scene, Lucius returns to the Colosseum and picks up some of the dirt, an obvious homage to the first film. A brief clip, which appears to be from the original film, then plays and shows a hand touching wheat in a field, a moment symbolic of one passing through to the afterlife.",
      "The screen then fades to black, leaving fans and viewers to wonder if there will be a third film in the \u201cGladiator\u201d universe."

      "More than 80 years later, \"Wicked,\" a prequel to the beloved film based on the Broadway musical of the same name, will hit theaters on Nov. 22.",
      "But is \"Wicked\" \u2014 which follows the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good \u2014 also family-friendly?",
      "\"Wicked\" was rated PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested, and some material may not be suitable for young children.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the kid-friendliness of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Is 'Wicked' for kids?",
      "Yes, \"Wicked\" is for kids, director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com.",
      "Chu says two of his five children, age 7 and 5, have seen \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy 3-year-old did not see it yet, but I\u2019m going to bring her,\u201d he adds.",
      "\"Wicked\" is rated PG for \"some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material.\"",
      "For parents of young kids, Chu notes: Beware the flying monkeys.",
      "Toward the end of \"Wicked,\" viewers learn the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West's famous henchman, her flying monkeys. Instead of costumed actors like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" uses computer-generated imagery for the monkeys (and all the other animals in the film, including a lion cub, bear and goat).",
      "Chu says the monkeys are \"definitely not as creepy\" as they were in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" However, a Washington Post review of the film argues the flying monkeys are more terrifying with CGI, warning parents, \"this is not a movie for very young children.\"",
      "As for thematic and brief suggestive material, the film does feature some romance. There's an onscreen kiss and an implied sexual encounter in one of the film's first scenes.",
      "What age is 'Wicked' appropriate for?",
      "Common Sense Media rates the film as appropriate for kids aged 10 and up, citing \"(light) jump-scares\" involving the flying monkeys, the Wizard of Oz's giant avatar head and the bullying Cynthia Erivo's character Elphaba experiences.",
      "The film is also long, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes in the theater, not including any previews.",
      "The original Broadway musical that the film is based on is recommended for children age 8 and up, and children under 5 years old are not admitted, according to the \"Wicked\" musical's website. The 1995 book that inspired the musical, Gregory Maguire's  \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch,\" is not for children and includes swearing, sex, violence and more mature themes.",
      "Chu overall describes his 2024 \u201cWicked\u201d film as \u201caccessible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about a relationship, and that relationship is nuanced \u2014 we\u2019ll see if kids pick that up,\u201d Chu says, referring to the complex friendship between Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande).",
      "\u201cI think they will fall in love with this friendship and this world. And there\u2019s a lot of things to look at and be enamored by,\u201d Chu says. \u201cBut in the end, I think they will love these two friends. And I think as a young person, when you\u2019re meeting new friends, I think that all connects with them, too.\u201d"

      "Part 1 of the film adaptation clocks in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it about the same length as the entire \"Wicked\" musical. But the first film is just half of the story, following the events of Act 1 while giving moments \"a chance to breathe,\" the musical's composer Stephen Schwartz says.",

      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",

Pfannee and Shenshen\u00a0(Bronwyn James) are at her side still, but a lot is in motion,\" Yang says. \"The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "\"The story is so flexible with how it relates to our real world,\" Yang adds.",
      "A love triangle",
      "Act 2 of the musical also delivers on lingering chemistry and Elphaba's unrequited feelings for Fiyero.",
      "While Elphaba resigned herself to being \"not that girl\" in Act 1, audience members learn in the second act that the reason Fiyero joined the Wizard's army was to take an active role in searching for Elphaba, who has been missing in action but speaking out against the Wizard, his leadership and his treatment of Animals (sentient animals).",
      "When Elphaba tries to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created at the end of Act 1, she runs into the Wizard, who, after a failed attempt to again sway her to his side, turns her in to his guards.",
      "She and Fiyero reunite, and instead of bringing her to the Wizard, he helps her escape and leaves with her, abandoning Glinda.",
      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",
      "A transformation",
      "While Elphaba leads a campaign against the Wizard, her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode in the film), has taken over as governor of Munchkinland in the wake of their father's death and rules harshly. Her relationship with Boq (Ethan Slater) has soured, and he stays by Nessarose's side under duress rather than love.",
      "Elphaba visits Nessarose in Act 2, and the younger sister airs her resentment. Elphaba then casts a spell on Nessarose's silver shoes, allowing her to walk. Boq responds by announcing his intentions to leave and declare his true affections for Glinda.",
      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: Part 2\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",

      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d producer Douglas Wick said the team learned \u201ca lot from the showmen of the ancient arena\u201d when they researched the first film.",
      "\u201cAs we contemplated a sequel, we reached back 2,000 years for guidance on how to top ourselves,\u201d Wick said, according to the press notes. \u201cThey had great answers. Enter the rhino.\u201d",
      "But is a gladiator facing a charging rhino something that could have actually happened in the Roman Colosseum? What about fending off a pack of ferocious, starved baboons, like Lucius, played by Paul Mescal, does while he's handcuffed?",
      "Lauren D. Ginsberg, associate professor of classical studies and theater studies at Duke University, gives TODAY.com an inside look into the historical accuracy of the three gladiator battles in the film featuring some seemingly absurd animals.",
      "\u201cThe goal, of course, was to have the strangest animals you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ginsberg says of the spectacles inside of the Colosseum. \u201cAnd that can mean animals no one has ever seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea was, especially for the Colosseum, the emperor can bring the whole Roman world to you,\u201d Ginsberg, who was not involved in the film, continues. \u201cAnd also every emperor has to do something flashier and more exciting and more innovative than the previous person.\u201d",
      "So, enter the rhino. And baboons. But sharks? Surprisingly, only one of these animals was completely out of the question in the Roman Empire, Ginsberg says.",
      "Could gladiators fight rhinos?",
      "While rhinos could appear in Roman arenas, gladiators weren't actually fighting them, Ginsberg says. Other animals could be brought in to fight each other, or professionally trained athletes could hunt the animals, she explains.",
      "But rhinos were a fan favorite among the Romans long before the Colosseum was even built.",
      "\u201cI think Julius Caesar was the first person that ever exhibited one, so even way before the Colosseum, because the Colosseum was built by the Flavian dynasty in the first century,\u201d Ginsberg says. \u201cRhinoceroses had been staples, but they weren\u2019t so common as to become boring. People were always still really excited when there was a rhinoceros.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg thinks rhinos were so popular for two main reasons.",
      "\u201cThey look interesting, but also because they\u2019re really angry creatures, or at least the way they were treated made them very angry in the arena, so they were often unpredictable, which was exciting,\u201d she says.",
      "While rhinos were a big hit at the Colosseum and other Roman arenas, Ginsberg does say there is no evidence to support a gladiator would have ever ridden one, like in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one was riding these wild animals. And part of that is that these were highly trained, very valuable athletes, so you don\u2019t actually want to put them in harm\u2019s way,\u201d she explains.",
      "What about baboons?",
      "In Lucius\u2019 first encounter with animals in the Colosseum, he\u2019s handcuffed along with several other prisoners and tasked with fighting off a slew of ravenous baboons.",
      "Wick, the film\u2019s producer, explained that many of the scenes in the movie came directly from Scott\u2019s mind.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be in a meeting discussing some story problem when Ridley would divine a solution. He thinks visually. We were pondering how to dramatize Lucius\u2019 anger as his superpower in the arena,\u201d Wick said, according to the press notes. \u201cRidley started to sketch Lucius in mortal battle with a ferocious baboon.\u201d",
      "In fact, Scott said he came up with the idea for the scene based on a real-life video of a baboon attack on a group of tourists in a parking lot in South Africa, according to the film's press notes.",
      "In the film, Lucius is not only able to fend off the baboons, but he eventually sinks his own teeth into one of the animals\u2019 arms and spits out the furry flesh. Due to his victory against the primates, he transforms from a prisoner to a gladiator.",
      "\u201cSuddenly there\u2019s a new alpha in the fight,\u201d Wick said of the scene.",
      "Ginsberg says monkeys were a possibility to appear in the arena, but they were a relatively late development and would have been hunted for sport.",
      "\u201cThe one reference that I found was Antoninus Pius was, at that time, credited with giving, like, the biggest possible Roman games of all time, which every emperor got, so every time it had to be more,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cHe brought monkeys from Africa, but they don\u2019t seem to have been the highlight of that show,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey were there, but they weren\u2019t the most famous animals. He also had rhinoceroses. And people were more into them.\u201d",
      "Other land animals Ginsberg found that took part in arena spectacles include elephants, ostriches, bears, bulls, lions, leopards, tigers, panthers and more.",
      "Ginsberg spoke of a large industry throughout the Roman Empire dedicated to locating exotic animals and transporting them back to the emperor, as well as teams of trainers and caretakers who kept the animals alive \u2014 and ready to fight.",
      "\u201cThere was a whole industry of people from, like, the moment you decided, \u2018I want an elephant from Africa,\u2019 that would be in charge of getting it, storing it, transporting it on a boat, getting it to where it needs to be, under the Colosseum, making sure it doesn\u2019t die, and then making sure it\u2019s ready to go out and give people the show that you want,\u201d she says.",
      "The baboon scene is also a great example of how differently gladiators were treated from prisoners, according to Ginsberg.",
      "\u201cGladiators would never be handcuffed because they\u2019re prized athletes. You came to watch them fight, and so handcuffing them would just not be interesting,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut prisoners, you absolutely wanted them to have no escape, and you also wanted them to die in the most dehumanizing way possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I tell my students, the Romans are jerks. Very interesting, but they\u2019re jerks,\u201d she adds.",
      "Sharks?",
      "In one of Lucius' clashes, the Colosseum is filled with water \u2014 and man-eating tiger sharks \u2014 as dozens of gladiators fight for their lives on ships in a staged naval battle.",
      "Ginsberg says that sharks would have never been in the Colosseum, or any ancient Roman amphitheater. \u201cI\u2019m willing to stake my reputation on this,\u201d she says through laughter.",
      "\u201cI actually have no proof that the Romans even knew what sharks were,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of sharks in the Mediterranean \u2014 it\u2019s not a very common creature ... but I racked my brain trying to think of anyone in the classical world that actually talks about sharks.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg did say that if the Romans knew that something like a great white or a hammerhead shark existed, and could find a way to transport it (Ginsberg notes there was unlikely to be any technology at the time to support such a journey), they would have \u201cbeen all about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey would have thought that was fantastic, and absolutely would have used them all the time, because they especially like sea creatures,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for sure, no.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg says there is evidence to support that some semiaquatic animals, like crocodiles and seals, were used in battles, as it was possible for the Colosseum to be filled with water.",
      "She cites works from Martial, a Roman poet who described watching reenactments of Roman naval engagements, as well as evidence of pipes and drains in the Colosseum itself that seems to suggest water could have been both brought in and removed.",
      "\u201cI think the estimates are, like, five hours to fill it and four hours to drain it,\u201d she says.",
      "Ginsberg adds that prisoners were the most likely to be used in these staged historical mock battles, which mainly showed Rome being triumphant against an easily stereotyped culture, often with exotic costumes.",
      "\u201cThose would not be professional gladiators. Those would often be condemned prisoners, because the idea would be that most of those people would drown and die, right? So you didn\u2019t want your top sports athletes doing that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t there would be, like, extra danger in the water, like sharks or other creatures.\u201d"

He isolated me from my whole entire life, he wouldn\u2019t let me be who I wanted to be, he made me hate everything that I loved about myself. He broke me down and then made me feel like he was all I had left, and he just kept repeatedly beating me down and beating me down.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast episode, she gave specific incidents of their fights. For example, LaPaglia said Bryan took issue with a dress she wore to the Golden Globes this past January.",
      "\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want to date someone who presents themselves that way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe makes me believe that I have to change my image to keep up with his, or something, so I was twisted in the head \u2014 OK, yeah, he doesn\u2019t want to be with a girl that, I don\u2019t know, has cleavage,\u2019\u201d she said.",

      "Post breakup, LaPaglia said she doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cdefined\u201d by their relationship. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I let my career be defined by what he did to me,\u201d she said on TikTok on Nov. 20.",
      "What does an NDA have to do with this?",
      "Also on the Nov. 7 episode of the podcast, LaPaglia said that Bryan wanted her to sign an NDA after their breakup and offered her $12 million and a New York apartment in exchange for her silence.",
      "She said she considered the offer \u201cfor a second,\u201d but said no because she doesn\u2019t \u201cthink you can pay people off that you hurt for them to protect you.\u201d",

      "LaPaglia said she didn\u2019t take the money so that she could speak out for other victims of emotional abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just for me, it\u2019s for anyone else that\u2019s been emotionally abused, it\u2019s for people right now that are being emotionally abused, it\u2019s for people that don\u2019t have a support system that I was luckily enough to have going through this. And the last year of my life has been the hardest year of my life, like dealing with the abuse from this dude,\u201d she said.",
      "LaPaglia said she wants to be a voice for survivors in a Nov. 20 TikTok video. \u201cI want to show people that it\u2019s OK to continue on with your life, and when it\u2019s hard to, that you have to \u2014 or you won\u2019t,\u201d she continued.",
      "She said she\u2019s gotten \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of DMs a day from men and women who have \u201cgotten the courage\u201d to leave their relationships or \u201cfinally felt validated.\u201d"

      "Both the movie and musical versions of \u201cWicked\u201d are based on the 1995 novel by Gregory Maguire, following the friendship between Elphaba and Glinda \u2014 two witches popularized by the \u201cWizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "The \"Wicked\" film adaptation is split into two parts. The first movie, which hit theaters Nov. 22, follows the events and songs of Act 1 of the musical. \"Wicked: Part 2\" is expected in November 2025.",
      "Director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com that he approached making the film adaptation from \u201ca very specific perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw it for the first time in San Francisco before it made it to Broadway,\u201d he says, referring to the musical\u2019s 2003 tryout performances before it opened at the Gershwin Theatre. \u201cThose are like core memories of when Glinda comes down in the bubble and during \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 \u2018What Is This Feeling?\u2019 \u2014 these things stayed with me through all of those years.",
      "\u201cSo I feel like I channel that first time seeing it,\u201d Chu adds.",
      "Composer Stephen Schwartz and \u201cWicked\u201d screenplay writer Winnie Holzman say when the show opened on Broadway in October 2003, they \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine being in November of 2003, having survived until that\u201d \u2014\u00a0much less a film adaptation.",
      "But once they did make it to November 2003, and the show proved a success, \u201cwe knew eventually it was going to be a movie,\u201d Schwartz says.",
      "\u201cSo really for 20 years, we've been talking, particularly Winnie and myself, about 'Well, in the movie, what if we do this? Maybe we should try that?'\" Schwartz says. \"We've been thinking about it for a long time, but what was most important to us was to tell our story in the movie.\"",
      "The first \u201cWicked\u201d film is faithful to Act 1 of the musical, all the way down to the soundtrack. No songs were cut, and with the exception of one song \u201cexpansion\u201d \u2014 as composer Stephen Schwartz puts it \u2014\u00a0the tracks are true to the original Broadway cast recording.",
      "But there are some minor changes that devoted \u201cWicked\u201d fans may pick up on.",
      "Chu notes that even if what happens on screen isn\u2019t exactly what happened on the stage, his goal was \u201cre-enacting those moments that I felt back then.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat it felt like was happening, I tried to do that in the movie,\u201d he says.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the differences between the \u201cWicked\u201d film and musical.",
      "The length",
      "Despite being only a portion of the beloved musical, the movie runs over two and a half hours, nearly as long as the full Broadway production.",
      "\u201cThis one movie is longer than the first act,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of the first act in terms of the storytelling, but it\u2019s as long as our whole show.\u201d",
      "Holzman says Chu felt \u201creally confident\u201d about the decision to split the movie in two. Once that happened, she says she had \u201cfreedom\u201d to slow down moments that may have happened quickly in the musical.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments that we ... really wanted to take and \u2014 \u201d Holzman says.",
      "\u201cGive them a chance to breathe,\u201d Schwartz adds.",
      "Trying to fit all of the \u201cWicked\u201d musical into one film would have been a \u201cburden,\u201d Schwartz says.",
      "\u201cIt was great not to constantly feel, with every musical moment, with every scene, \u2018Oh, we simply don\u2019t have time,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cOnce that burden was lifted, it was very inspiring.\u201d",
      "Both Schwartz and Holzman wrote new songs and scenes for Part 1 that didn't end up in the final cut.",
      "\u201cWe tried to be very careful that anything we expanded was additive and not padded,\u201d he says.",
      "An expanded backstory for Elphaba and Nessarose",
      "In both \u201cWicked\u201d the musical and movie, Elphaba\u2019s backstory is explored in the opening track, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\u201d The song, sung by Glinda, walks through how Elphaba\u2019s mom drank a green elixir before having an affair, which ultimately leads to her baby arriving with a tinted skin tone. After Elphaba is born, her father wants nothing to do with her.",
      "But the movie takes a beat to show what her childhood looked like. After her birth, Elphaba's nanny, a bear named Dulcibear, raises the child and vowed to look after her. Her relationship with her younger sister Nessarose is also explored more deeply.",
      "\u201cThere are things that go past in lightning speed, like the two sisters,\u201d Holzman says of the \u201cWicked\u201d musical. \u201cWhen you first meet them, if you blink, you miss their conversation.\u201d",
      "In the movie, there's a scene where Elphaba is bullied as a child for her appearance. It also establishes a loving and protective relationship with Nessarose by showing Elphaba fight back after the kids make her sister cry.",
      "Nessarose, played by Marissa Bode, also asserts independence in the film. Bode, who is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life, says her character goes off to attend Shiz University to be on her own and \u201cprove to yourself that you can, even though you already know that you can,\u201d Bode says.",
      "In the musical, Elphaba arrives at Shiz as an enrolled student under strict orders to look after her sister. In the movie, however, Elphaba isn't enrolled, and only stays at school after she accidentally uses her powers, catching the eye of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh).",
      "More details on the Grimmerie",
      "While most of the songs of the \u201cWicked\u201d movie soundtrack are the same as the musical, \u201cOne Short Day\u201d has a notable addition.",
      "The song follows Glinda and Elphaba as they arrive in the Emerald City to meet with the Wizard of Oz. The movie\u2019s version of \u201cOne Short Day\u201d includes new bars of music sung by \u2014\u00a0much to Broadway fans\u2019 delight \u2014 Idina Menzel, who originated the role of Elphaba, and Kristin Chenoweth, the original Glinda.",
      "In the cameo, they jokingly battle for the spotlight and sing some of their iconic riffs.",
      "Menzel and Chenoweth perform as part of the Emerald City players troupe, taking on the roles of fabled Wise Ones who wrote down their spells in a book known as the Grimmerie.",
      "The Grimmerie ends up being the key to Elphaba unlocking her powers and transforming into a witch, and the movie gives more details on how it led to the Wizard assuming power.",
      "According to the Wise Ones\u2019 prophetic song, \u201cin Oz\u2019s darkest hour,\u201d a powerful figure with the ability to read the Grimmerie will come along and lead Oz. That person ended up being the Wizard, after he landed in Oz via a hot air balloon. Now can he actually read the Grimmerie? That\u2019s another story.",
      "\u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 Easter eggs",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d is notably a prequel story to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d but Part 1 of the film offers more Easter eggs to L. Frank Baum\u2019s story and the 1939 film.",
      "While both the film and musical open with the rousing musical number \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked,\u201d set after the death of the Wicked Witch of the West, the movie firmly places the story in time with \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "The first scene of the film features the voice of Ariana Grande's Glinda declaring the Wicked Witch of the West dead. The camera pans to a black witch's hat sitting atop a puddle of water, a reference to how the witch melted in the 1939 film after Dorothy threw a pail of water at her.",
      "\u201cWe drop into a crime scene. We don\u2019t drop into a big musical number, we drop into a puddle of water,\u201d Chu says. \u201cTo me, that was really important to return us to the scene of the crime, the place we last left Oz.\u201d",
      "From there, Oz comes into full focus. Viewers see someone escaping a castle on horseback. Then the camera pans to the yellow brick road, as the figures of Dorothy and her companions follow the path toward the Emerald City.",
      "The focus then moves into Munchkinland, and the opening notes of \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked\u201d kick in.",
      "In another \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d connection, the movie changes a scene to involve poppy flowers. After Dr. Dillamond is removed from his teaching position, a new teacher brings in a lion cub to teach a lesson on cages. Elphaba, noticing the cub is trembling, casts a spell in the musical to cause chaos and help rescue the animal.",
      "But in the movie, Elphaba accidentally uses poppy flowers to put everyone in the classroom \u2014 except for herself and Jonathan Bailey's Fiyero \u2014 to sleep. Then, they rescue the cub and set him free in the wild.",
      "The poppies seem to foreshadow a scene in the \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d when the four main characters \u2014 Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion \u2014 travel through a field of the same flowers. In the story, both Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep.",
      "Later, once Elphaba and Glinda are in Oz, the Wizard shows them his vision of the city, including a long winding road. He runs through several options for the color of the pathway, and Glinda ultimately suggests making the brick road yellow."

      "So what exactly happened at the end of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d for the cast to say they felt a spiritual connection? Keep reading to find out.",
      "What is \u2018The Piano Lesson\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d follows the lives of the Charles family in Doaker Charles's home.",
      "Set in Pittsburgh in 1936, the film is based on August Wilson\u2019s 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. It centers on the struggle between a brother and sister, Boy Willie and Berniece, who fight over their family\u2019s treasured heirloom, an engraved wooden piano, which documents the family\u2019s history through special carvings made by their enslaved ancestor.",
      "Is \u2018The Piano Lesson\u2019 based on a true story?",
      "No, \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is not based on a true story.",
      "In an interview with Dennis Watlington, published in the book \u201cConversations with August Wilson,\u201d Wilson said the inspiration and title for \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d came from a \u201cRomare Bearden painting\u201d he saw.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a painting of a woman, a piano, and a little girl playing the piano,\u201d he said, describing Romare Bearden\u2019s 1983 \u2018The Piano Lesson\u2019 collage. \u201cThe woman is standing over her, and I heard the woman in my mind admonishing the little girl: Now you, Maretha, get your piano lesson. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d",
      "Wilson said Bearden\u2019s work made him want to \u201cexplore the question, \u2018Can you acquire a sense of self-worth by denying your past?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you can, and I wanted to show this,\u201d he said, referring to his 1987 play. \u201cI had the idea of this piano. I wanted it to be very visible on stage. I wanted the piano in the course of the play to get bigger and bigger. I figured the more you understand about the piano, the more you understand about these people. The piano goes back 137 years, and was used to purchase members of the family during slavery.\u201d",
      "Who are the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog in \u2018The Piano Lesson\u2019?",
      "The Ghosts of the Yellow Dog in \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d are the spirits of men who died in the 357 Yellow Dog boxcar train after it was set on fire by a group of white men who were looking for the people who stole the piano from slave owner Robert Sutter\u2019s house.",
      "Aside from Boy Charles (Willie Boy\u2019s father), who was involved in the removal of the piano from Sutter\u2019s home, it\u2019s unclear who else was in the box car.",
      "Jackson, who plays Doaker Charles in the film, says it\u2019s also unclear who exactly lit the boxcar on fire, though many believe it was Robert Sutter, Sheriff Carter, Ed Saunders and/or Robert Smith.",
      "Following the deaths the men in the boxcar, Saunders, Sutter and others who were said to have been responsible for the men\u2019s deaths were said to have died \u201caccidentally\u201d by falling into wells.",
      "\u201cPeople said it was the ghosts of them men what died in that boxcar pushed him in his well,\u201d Jackson says in the film of Saunders' mysterious death.",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018The Piano Lesson\u2019 movie?",
      "In the final moments of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d Berniece asks Avery Brown, a local pastor and her suitor, to \u201cbless\u201d their house after Wining Boy seemingly conjures up a spiritual presence when he drunkenly plays the piano.",
      "As the lights flicker and the house gets colder, Avery begins a Christian ritual to cast out the spirit of James Sutter, but his attempts are unfruitful as paranormal things continue to happen around the house.",
      "Meanwhile, Boy Wille, in his own futile attempt to get rid of Sutter\u2019s ghost, antagonizes the spirit by calling out his name and sprinkling water around the house.",
      "\u201cCome get some of this water. You already fell down the well,\u201d Boy Willie says.",
      "As Boy Willie runs upstairs to sprinkle more water around the house, an unseen presence pushes him and he flies through the air, hitting the wall and falling back down the stairs.",
      "The family looks on, shocked by the incident as Boy Willie tries to reorient himself. Refusing to give up, Boy Willie heads back upstairs and calls out Sutter\u2019s name \u2014 only to be repeatedly struck down by an unseen presence. Eventually, Boy Willie is seen being choked by Sutter\u2019s ghost as Avery\u2019s ritual ultimately fails \u2014 as indicated by the snuffing out of the candle Berniece holds during the ceremony.",
      "Avery acknowledges he \u201ccan\u2019t do it\u201d and pleads with Berniece to take over.",
      "Berniece quietly agrees to take on the ritual and sits at the piano as she calls out to her ancestors\u2019 names.",
      "\u201cI want you to help me,\u201d she says repeatedly as the lights flicker on and off in their home.",
      "\u201cI want you to help me, Mama Berniece,\u201d she continues as she strikes a key on the piano. She proceeds to call for Mama Ester, Papa Boy Charles and Mama Ola to help her as she dramatically strikes keys on the piano.",
      "As Berniece calls their names and plays the piano, the spirits of her ancestors are seen gathered around her with their hands placed on her as she plays.",
      "While Berniece plays as she\u2019s surrounded by her ancestors, Sutter\u2019s ghost is suddenly engulfed in flames and Boy Wille is finally let loose from his iron grip.",
      "The house then returns back to normal with the lights no longer flickering and the candle regaining its flame. Berniece rocks back and forth and says thank you to her ancestors.",
      "As the family looks around at the now silent house, Boy Willie comes down the stairs and clears this throat.",
      "\u201cBerniece, if you and Maretha don\u2019t keep playing on that piano, ain\u2019t no telling,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cMe and Sutter both likely to come back.\u201d",
      "They hug and Berniece tells him \u201cthank you\u201d as tears run down her face.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Deadwyler spoke more about the emotions she felt and the implications of the final scene.",
      "\u201cYou want to uphold legacy \u2013 less reputation in my sense, and more about connecting to what has existed before you that you are not as aware of and know that can come from you,\u201d she says, reflecting on how she felt during that moment at piano where she says she was in the presence of her \u201cancestors.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that my last living grandparent, whom I love and adore, and encouraged me in all of her quiet ways, and had a completely different life than myself. My grandmother was with me,\u201d she adds.",
      "As part of the final scene, Berniece is now seen teaching her daughter Maretha how to play the piano as she they sit together on its bench.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d concludes with a fast-forward to Boy Willie\u2019s return down South in what appears to be the same field of where his ancestors worked. As he shifts through the dirt in the field with his hands, glimpses of his father interchanges with his own image. In those final moments, it appears that Boy Willie has decided to move on from purchasing Sutter\u2019s property as he drives away from the property\u2019s big for sale sign at the end scene."

      "The Israeli offensive in Gaza\u00a0has devastated\u00a0wide areas, and around 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with little food, water or basic services.",
      "At least two women were shot dead Saturday while waiting in line for bread in central Deir al-Balah, relatives and witnesses told the AP. It was unclear who shot them and why.",
      "The United Nations says its attempts to support hard-hit northern Gaza, which has been the focus of a renewed Israeli offensive for weeks, have been denied or impeded, and that less than 20% of the population has remained there since the offensive began."

      "The incoming administration is likely to pressure European leaders to take a harder line on China, which it sees as America\u2019s main enemy, but their countries are economically intertwined with both powers and their interests don\u2019t always align with Washington\u2019s, several European officials and diplomats told NBC News. Were Trump to follow through on his vow to impose tariffs on imports on Europe as well as from China, they would likely deviate further.",

      "There are signs that European countries may decide the answer is to move closer to China, potentially opening a rift with the U.S.",
      "During his first administration, Trump was hyperfocused on China, and since then he has maintained his hard-line stance against the country, which both the U.S. and Europe view as an economic competitor and systemic rival, even as they count it among their biggest trading partners.",
      "Days before the U.S. presidential election, Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., wrote in The Economist that the next president should quickly end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and \u201cfinally focus strategic attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d",

      "They soured further after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with some European leaders suggesting Beijing should lean harder on Moscow to end the conflict.",
      "Still, four European diplomats and officials from key Western capitals, who asked not to be named to be able to speak freely, said their countries are not seeking full-on confrontation with China.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be dragged into the foreign policy toward China which the new American administration will be engaged in,\u201d said one of the senior European officials. \u201cAmerica is our friend and ally.

      "Starmer called for \u201cconsistent, durable\u201d ties between the two countries, while Xi said they have \u201cvast potential for cooperation.\u201d Though Starmer told reporters he had had a \u201cfrank\u201d discussion with Xi about issues where China and Britain disagree, he was criticized by British lawmakers for not publicly condemning the prison sentences handed down this week to\u00a045 pro-democracy figures\u00a0in the Chinese territory of\u00a0Hong Kong, as well as the ongoing trial of pro-democracy media tycoon\u00a0Jimmy Lai, a British national.",
      "Xi also discussed the war in Ukraine as well as E.U. tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles in meetings with Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the G20 summit.",
      "In some ways, a second Trump term might be \u201cgood news\u201d for Europe, because unlike President Joe Biden, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t care that much\u201d about rallying U.S. allies against China, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cThat will give Europeans more leeway in managing their relations with China,\u201d Wu said Monday at an event hosted by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Centre on Contemporary China and the World.",

      "Russian threat",
      "For many Europeans, it is Moscow, not Beijing, that poses an immediate threat. In their view, China could help to pressure Russia over Ukraine as Xi loses patience with a war he did not expect would drag on for almost three years.",
      "One senior European diplomat said that while China has never explicitly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it has helped in other ways to rein in Moscow.",
      "\u201cThey have been firm with Russia about not using nuclear weapons with Ukraine,\u201d the diplomat said.",
      "China is also concerned about the growing security ties between Russia and North Korea after the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership in June, the diplomat added.",
      "The U.S. and others say that the secretive communist state\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, has sent thousands of troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine in exchange for technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",

      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu's office branding the decision \"antisemitic,\" rejecting the charges as \"absurd and false\" and condemning the ICC as a \"biased and discriminatory political body.\"",
      "Hamas welcomed the warrants as an \"important step towards justice\" but senior political official Basem Naim said the court's decision \"remains limited and symbolic if it is not supported by all means by all countries around the world to implement it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that the U.S. \u201cfundamentally rejects the Court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials\" and that it was \"deeply concerned by the prosecutor\u2019s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.\"",
      "Both Israel and the U.S. do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants. But the warrants do put the Israeli officials at risk of arrest in other countries, including much of Europe.",
      "In its announcement Thursday the ICC rejected challenges from Israel to its jurisdiction. It said the warrants issued for Netanyahu and Gallant were related to \"crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October, 2023 until at least 20 May, 2024,\" including \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\"",
      "It also said reasonable grounds were found to believe they bore criminal responsibility as \"civilian superiors\" for the war crime of \"intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population.\"",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant were accused of having \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity.\"",
      "The ICC said it further found that their conduct had hampered the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential items to those in desperate need in the enclave.",

      "President Joe Biden has authorized Kyiv to use U.S. weapons for strikes deep inside Russia, according to two U.S. officials \u2014 a major policy shift that drew a furious response from the Kremlin on Monday, accusing the administration of pouring \"oil on the fire\" two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Crucially for Ukraine, the decision comes after months of pleading and just as Russia has intensified a wave of aerial attacks that forced widespread blackouts and killed more than a dozen people, according to local officials.",
      "\"It is excellent news for us and a significant move,\" Kyiv resident  Maryna Vlasenko, 39, told NBC News.",
      "She also bemoaned the lengthy process and the continued limits on Ukraine's use of the long-range weapons, however. \u201cSometimes I just have a feeling that we are receiving the bare minimum in order not to die, and with such an attitude, Ukraine will bleed to death,\u201d  Vlasenko said in an interview Monday.",

      "The U.S. has for months rebuffed Kyiv's pleas to lift the restrictions on its usage of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in the Kursk border region of Russia.

      "Despite the warnings and protestations, however, analysts said it was unlikely that the U.S. decision would either provoke major escalation from the Kremlin or do significant damage to the Russian military's positions on the front lines, which have broadly been improving with each passing day.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "They feared the toll would rise as communications in the area are down and fresh information on casualties is difficult to come by. They said the helicopter carrying the government delegation was also shot at, but managed to land safely on Saturday.",
      "Armed groups have attacked settlements that are populated by members of rival sects. Many homes have been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations have been set alight, the officials said."

    "title": "Chess' future looms over the world championship, once again missing its biggest star",
    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:00:39 GMT",
    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions will pit a teen phenom from India against a soft-spoken assassin from China \u2014 but it will be missing the GOAT from Norway.",
      "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China. And while it is still considered the game\u2019s marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, this should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

      "Verstappen becomes just the sixth driver in F1 history to capture four world championships, joining an elite club with Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, Alain Prost and Juan Manuel Fangio.",
      "\u201cOh my God, man. What a season,\u201d Verstappen said while still in his car over team radio. \u201cFour times! Thank you... It\u2019s been a little more difficult than last year, but we pulled through. And we gave it all.\u201d",
      "With actor and filmmaker Sylvester Stallone waving the checkered flag, Mercedes driver George Russell won the 50-lap race after qualifying in pole position, ahead of Mercedes teammate Hamilton in 2nd place and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz in 3rd.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of incredible young talent in the sport and Lando is definitely one of them. And of course, at times, he made it very difficult for me,\u201d Verstappen said\u00a0at a post-race news conference.",
      "Norris congratulated Verstappen after the race, saying he made the most of his opportunities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the strength of his,\u201d Norris told reporters. \u201cHe has no negatives. When he had the quickest car, he dominated races. When he\u2019s not the quickest car, he\u2019s still just behind us and almost winning the races anyway\u2026 He just gets everything out of the car every time.\u201d",
      "The international sport has brought a new level of glitz and glamor \u2014 and a title-decider \u2014 to Las Vegas. Celebrities made appearances in the paddock, with some attendees dropping tens of thousands of dollars for premium trackside tickets in hospitality suites.",
      "\u201cI love fast cars, I love racing and I love Las Vegas,\u201d Paris Hilton, a fan of McLaren and Norris, told NBC News on the grid moments before the race started. \u201cSo it\u2019s a perfect combination of fun.\u201d",
      "The track is best-known for its 1.2 mile-long straight along the famous Las Vegas Boulevard, where the cars reached a top speed of about 221 mph as they zipped by the Venetian, the Bellagio and other casinos on the Strip, while providing a series of exciting overtakes for the fans in attendance.",
      "Verstappen played it safe and took few risks, putting up little defense as the two rapid Ferraris of Sainz and Charles Leclerc challenged and ultimately overtook him. Neither of the Ferrari or Mercedes drivers were mathematically in the title hunt.",
      "Ahead of the race, Norris told reporters that the title was all but out of reach regardless of what happened in Vegas.",

      "Aside from the road closures and inconveniences for many locals, the race has been a boon to Las Vegas. A report by Nevada\u2019s Clark County said the economic impact of the race was nearly $1.5 billion. Race attendance last year was 316,000, the report added.",
      "And U.S. interest could soon get another boost.",
      "Insiders expect Formula 1 to admit an 11th team on the grid, likely called Cadillac F1, in 2026, sources with knowledge told NBC News.",
      "The anticipated move is linked to an earlier bid by Andretti and GM-backed Cadillac that was green-lit by the sport's governing body, the FIA, but rejected by F1's commercial side. The shift comes amid a commitment from Cadillac to build its own power unit starting in 2028, and changes in the Andretti organization that have put investor Daniel Towriss (rather than Michael Andretti) at the helm of the bid. The news was first reported by the Associated Press.",
      "A spokesperson for Formula 1 declined to comment. The sport's commercial owner, Liberty Media, is facing an investigation by the Department of Justice for potential antitrust violations after denying the earlier bid by Andretti, the company told investors in August.",
      "If approved, the decision would put a famous American team and car manufacturer in the pinnacle of motorsport. It would occur in the same year that Red Bull is set to partner with Ford to build its power unit, setting up a clash of U.S. car giants.",
      "Verstappen\u2019s triumph wasn\u2019t a sure thing",
      "For all his successes, it's been a turbulent season for Verstappen as he has navigated car problems, formidable rivals and seemingly nonstop drama surrounding him off the track.",
      "After winning seven out of the first 10 races, Verstappen has won just one of the last 12 races. The early string of victories have been crucial in Verstappen\u2019s quest for a fourth world championship.",
      "It came after Verstappen had a record-smashing season in 2023, winning 19 of the 22 races during the season. The dominance of his Red Bull car continued into the early part of the 2024 season, but rapidly tapered off as McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes improved their cars and challenged for victories.",
      "Verstappen's campaign was also helped by the fact that multiple rival teams caught up \u2014 if not surpassed Red Bull \u2014 around the same time. The season has seen a total of seven race-winners: including the six drivers with McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes. In numerous cases where Verstappen struggled, others took points off Norris and hindered his quest to challenge the Dutchman."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:42:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The Kremlin said Friday that its attack using a new ballistic missile was a warning to Ukraine's \"reckless\" Western allies.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed that a newly developed ballistic missile fired into Ukraine earlier in the week was incapable of being intercepted, the culmination of a week of escalating threats to the West.",
      "\u201cThere is no countermeasure to such a\u00a0missile, no means of intercepting it,\" Putin said in televised comments, according to Reuters. \"And I\u00a0will emphasize once again that we will continue testing this\u00a0newest system. It is necessary to establish serial production.\"",
      "Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said its attack using the hypersonic \u201cOreshnik\u201d\u00a0missile was a warning to Ukraine\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d Western allies.",
      "On Thursday, Putin said he had ordered a strike with the new intermediate-range ballistic missile in response to Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia for the first time.",
      "Despite Moscow\u2019s deployment of the new weapon, which carried multiple warheads, the United States and its European partners have vowed not to be deterred in their support for Kyiv.",
      "Meanwhile, new details were emerging about the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued his own nuclear threat to his U.S.-backed southern neighbor and accused Washington of fueling tensions.",
      "The latest round of saber rattling from Putin and Kim has come during a week in which the war in Ukraine passed 1,000 days and with Washington preparing for a change in leadership.",
      "Still, Western officials and analysts have sought to play down what they said was an effort to intimidate Kyiv and its backers.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried the use of the new missile on the eastern city of Dnipro as a \"severe escalation.\" He also announced that Ukraine was holding meetings with its \"partners\" about new air defense systems to counter any new threats.",
      "On Thursday, he said the Russian missile strike was a second major step toward escalation after the Kremlin's deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops.",
      "On Friday, Kim warned that due to U.S. hostility, his region had never faced a greater risk of \"the most destructive thermonuclear war,\" according to the KCNA state news agency.",
      "The Kim-Putin alliance was likely one factor behind the decision of Washington and its allies to relax restrictions on Kyiv. And NATO, the Western military alliance bracing for a second Donald Trump presidency, said it would not stop that support in the face of Putin's threats.",
      "\u201cDeploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,\u201d alliance spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said.",
      "Biden administration officials briefed Ukraine and other allies in recent days to help them prepare for Russia possibly using the new weapon, according to a U.S. official.",
      "\u201cRussia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict,\u201d the U.S. official said.",
      "Ukraine's use of long-range Western weapons to strike Russian soil followed months of pleading during which it came under intensifying Russian attacks in the air and on the battlefield.",
      "In a sign of the danger felt on the ground, the Ukrainian Parliament canceled a session Friday and reduced staff presence because of the increased threat of a missile attack on the area housing government buildings, the country\u2019s public broadcaster said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Beluosov said that his forces had sped up their advance and \u201cdisrupted\u201d the Ukrainian military\u2019s plans for the upcoming year.",
      "On a visit to a command post of the country\u2019s \u201cnorth\u201d group of forces \u2014 the group targeted by a Ukrainian strike in the Kursk border region that used British Storm Shadow long-range missiles \u2014 Beluosov said that Ukraine\u2019s \u201cbest units were ground down here\u201d and that \"the advancement [of the Russian Armed Forces] has accelerated.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry, which posted the comments Friday, did not say when or where the visit took place.",
      "Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher at the Geneva-based United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, was unconvinced by escalating Russian threats.",
      "Russia clearly felt the need to respond to Ukraine's crossing its red lines, he said. But, he told NBC News in a phone interview Friday after the new missile was launched that it is \"unclear what this is adding to Russian capabilities.\"",
      "While the new missile had multiple warheads, it was not clear how precise they were, Baklitskiy said.",
      "The U.S. said the Oreshnik \u2014 or \u201cHazel tree\u201d \u2014 was a new, experimental type of missile based on the design of the existing RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile.",
      "Kyiv initially claimed that Russia had fired an ICBM.",
      "The weapon would also likely be \"quite expensive,\" Baklitskiy said, so not something the Kremlin could regularly deploy.",
      "While Baklitsky conceded that the attack still had its uses as a thinly veiled threat that it could one day unleash a nuclear payload, he caveated that by pointing to signals that the Kremlin was still eager to avoid significant escalation\u00a0\u2014 Russia notified U.S. officials about the attack using nuclear risk reduction communication channels.",
      "\"You are responding with something you haven\u2019t used before,\" he  added. \"But then it\u2019s not escalatory in the sense of things getting out of hand.\""

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A woman who claimed mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor \u201cbrutally raped and battered\u201d her in a Dublin hotel penthouse was awarded nearly 250,000 Euros ($257,000) on Friday by a civil court jury in Ireland.",
      "The woman said the Dec. 9, 2018 assault after a night of partying had left her heavily bruised and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "McGregor shook his head as the jury of eight women and four men returned the verdict after deliberating about six hours in the High Court in Dublin. He was mobbed by cameras as he left court but did not comment.",
      "McGregor testified that he never forced the woman to do anything against her will and said she fabricated the allegations after the two had consensual sex.",
      "The woman\u2019s lawyer said she never pretended to be a saint and had gone out looking for a good time that ended up turning into a nightmare.",
      "Attorney John Gordon said McGregor was angry about a fight he had lost in Las Vegas two months earlier and took it out on his client.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not a man, he\u2019s a coward,\u201d Gordon told jurors. \u201cA devious coward and you should treat him for what he is.\u201d",
      "The woman had to take several breaks in her emotional testimony as she said McGregor threatened to kill her during the encounter.",
      "McGregor put her in a choke hold several times and later told her, \u201cnow you know how I felt in the octagon where I tapped out three times,\u201d referring to an Ultimate Fighting Championship when he had to admit defeat, she said.",
      "She feared she would die and never see her daughter again.",
      "\u201cHe let me go and I remember saying I was sorry, as I felt that I did something wrong and I wanted to reassure him that I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone so he wouldn\u2019t hurt me again,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she then let him do what he wanted and he had sex with her.",
      "Police investigated the woman\u2019s complaint, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, saying there was insufficient evidence and a conviction was unlikely.",
      "McGregor said the two had sex that was athletic and vigorous, but not rough. He said \u201cshe never said \u2018no\u2019 or stopped\u201d and testified that everything she said was a lie.",
      "\u201cIt is a full blown lie among many lies,\u201d he said when asked about the chokehold allegation. \u201cHow anyone could believe that me, as a prideful person, would highlight my shortcomings.\u201d",
      "McGregor\u2019s lawyer told jurors they had to set aside their animus toward the fighter.",
      "\u201cYou may have an active dislike of him, some of you may even loathe him \u2014 there is no point pretending that the situation might be otherwise,\u201d attorney Remy Farrell said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to invite him to Sunday brunch.\u201d",
      "The defense said the woman never told investigators McGregor threatened her life. They also showed surveillance video in court that they said appeared to show the woman kiss McGregor\u2019s arm and hug him after they left the hotel room. Farrell said she looked \u201chappy, happy, happy.\u201d",
      "McGregor said that when he was first questioned by police, he read them a prepared statement. On the advice of his lawyer, he refused to answer more than 100 follow-up questions."
