      "The U.S. State Department's revelation that it has revoked visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is the latest indication that the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make public points",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the United States revokes someone's visa, it is typically confidential, with few exceptions. But with British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan and others, the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make a public point when it deems a case particularly egregious.",
      "The State Department\u2019s number two diplomat made headlines when he posted a social media message this week saying visas for the band for an upcoming U.S. tour had been revoked. British police are investigating whether a crime was committed when the duo's frontman led the audience in chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces \u2014 at a music festival in the U.K.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that their visas had been revoked \u201cin light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\u201d",
      "The band rejected claims of antisemitism and said in a statement that it was being \u201ctargeted for speaking up\u201d about the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and certain statutes related to the privacy of government documents, the State Department has for years resisted or refused to discuss specific cases in which visas may have been denied or revoked. Certain exemptions apply, such as when foreign officials and their immediate family members are found to ineligible for entry into the United States for violating anti-corruption or human rights regulations.",
      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",
      "\u201cForeigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said when asked about the public announcement.",
      "She said one reason for announcing the revocations was to make clear that the administration is serious about the standards it will apply to visa holders and applicants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about that standard, and this was a very public event that violated that very basic standard about the nature of who we want to let into the country,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Other recent cases have been less clear-cut, although some have ended up in public court cases.",
      "Earlier this year, as part of an initiative to expel foreign students who are accused by the Trump administration of engaging in pro-Hamas, anti-Israel or antisemitic activity, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had rescinded at least 300 visas and expected that number to rise.",
      "Many of those cases were not publicized individually.",
      "One that was: Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained by immigration authorities in Massachusetts for authoring an opinion piece criticizing Tufts University for not taking a tougher line on alleged Israeli atrocities in Gaza.",
      "U.S. officials said at the time that her visa had been revoked because of adverse foreign policy consequences if she remained in the United States.",
      "Other high-profile and public cases of visa revocations for political reasons date back decades, including actor Charlie Chaplin in 1952 during the Truman administration and an ultimately unsuccessful deportation attempt against Beatles singer John Lennon in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe practice of ideological exclusion has a long history in the United States, having been used for decades as a political tool to keep U.S. audiences from being exposed to dissident viewpoints,\u201d the human rights group Amnesty International said in a 2020 report.",
      "\u201cDuring the Cold War, in particular, the U.S. government denied visas to some of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, writers and artists who, the government thought, might promote Communism or other 'subversive' views,\u201d it said.",

      "While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his high-stakes federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel",
      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "Monday was the last day as an independent agency for the six-decade-old humanitarian and development organization, created by President John F. Kennedy as a peaceful way of promoting U.S. national security by boosting goodwill and prosperity abroad.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered USAID absorbed into the State Department on Tuesday.",
      "The former presidents and Bono spoke with thousands in the USAID community in a videoconference, which was billed as a closed-press event to allow political leaders and others privacy for sometimes angry and often teary remarks. Parts of the video were shared with The Associated Press.",
      "They expressed their appreciation for the thousands of USAID staffers who have lost their jobs and life's work. Their agency was one of the first and most fiercely targeted for government-cutting by President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, with staffers abruptly locked out of systems and offices and terminated by mass emailing.",
      "Trump claimed the agency was run by \u201cradical left lunatics\u201d and rife with \u201ctremendous fraud.\u201d Musk called it \u201ca criminal organization.\u201d",
      "Obama, speaking in a recorded statement, offered assurances to the aid and development workers, some listening from overseas.",
      "\"Your work has mattered and will matter for generations to come,\u201d he told them.",
      "Obama has largely kept a low public profile during Trump\u2019s second term and refrained from criticizing the monumental changes that Trump has made to U.S. programs and priorities at home and abroad.",
      "\u201cGutting USAID is a travesty, and it\u2019s a tragedy. Because it\u2019s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world,\u201d Obama said. He credited USAID with not only saving lives, but being a main factor in global economic growth that has turned some aid-receiving countries into U.S. markets and trade partners.",
      "The former Democratic president predicted that \u201dsooner or later, leaders on both sides of the aisle will realize how much you are needed.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the State Department said it would be introducing the department\u2019s foreign assistance successor to USAID, to be called America First, this week.",
      "\u201cThe new process will ensure there is proper oversight and that every tax dollar spent will help advance our national interests,\u201d the department said.",
      "USAID oversaw programs around the world, providing water and life-saving food to millions uprooted by conflict in Sudan, Syria, Gaza and elsewhere, sponsoring the \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d that revolutionized modern agriculture and curbed starvation and famine, preventing disease outbreaks, promoting democracy, and providing financing and development that allowed countries and people to climb out of poverty.",
      "Bush, who also spoke in a recorded message, went straight to the cuts in a landmark AIDS and HIV program started by his Republican administration and credited with saving 25 million lives around the world.",
      "Bipartisan blowback from Congress to cutting the popular President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, helped save significant funding for the program. But cuts and rule changes have reduced the number getting the life-saving care.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve showed the great strength of America through your work \u2014 and that is your good heart,\u2019\u2019 Bush told USAID staffers. \u201cIs it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you,\" he said.",
      "Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, former Colombian President Juan Manual Santos and former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield also spoke to the staffers.",
      "So did humanitarian workers, including one who spoke of the welcome appearance of USAID staffers with food when she was a frightened 8-year-old child in a camp for Liberian refugees. A World Food Program official vowed through sobs that the U.S. aid mission would be back someday.",
      "Bono, a longtime humanitarian advocate in Africa and elsewhere, was announced as the \u201csurprise guest,\u201d in shades and a cap.",
      "He jokingly hailed the USAID staffers as \u201csecret agents of international development\u201d in acknowledgment of the down-low nature of Monday\u2019s unofficial gathering of the USAID community.",
      "Bono spoke passionately as he recited a poem he had written to the agency and its gutting. He spoke of children dying of malnutrition, in a reference to people \u2014 millions, experts have said \u2014 who will die because of the U.S cuts to funding for health and other programs abroad.",
      "\u201cThey called you crooks. When you were the best of us,\u201d Bono said.",

      "Oliver devoted a May 4 segment to names and promotions of minor league baseball teams, announcing: \u201cWe are willing to use all of our resources and stupidity to give one Minor League Baseball team a total rebrand.

      "Oliver announced Sunday he had chosen Moon Mammoths, using Bob Costas' voice as narrator of a promotional video introducing the moniker.",
      "The name was inspired by the 1991 discovery of woolly mammoth remains by George Moon, a Summit Township resident who found a bone while scuba diving in Lake Pleasant, about 8 miles south of Erie. The mammoth remains are housed in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Erie, which has won the past two Eastern League championships, will be renamed the Moon Mammoths for games on July 19, Aug. 19, Sept. 12 and Sept. 13.",
      "Major League Baseball said Monday the team will wear jerseys with a rising moon with the team\u2019s name across the chest, a moon on sleeves and a patch with a woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "Oliver is expected to attend the July 19 game against Chesapeake, called a \u201cMammoth Fun\u201d night. The first 1,000 ticketed fans will receive a Moon Mammoths squishy toy and there will be postgame fireworks. George Moon was also invited to attend.",

      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",
      "The center, which previously featured daily programs such as taekwondo and ballet, may not be operational in a few months if the funding landscape remains as is.",
      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",
      "A spokesman for the administration said Prasad \u201chas raised serious concerns\u201d about the issue.",
      "\u201cWe will not ignore these risks and will ensure that the gold standard of science is used for any decisions,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, in an emailed statement.",
      "Outside researchers have noted that cases of the heart condition tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",

      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",

      "\u201cThe level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,\" said District Attorney Melinda Katz. \u201cI thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court has thrown out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices\u2019 recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.",
      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",
      "The justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.",
      "The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.",
      "In one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care.",

    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian woman, Olha Kurtmalaieva, has endured cancer and war while fighting to bring her husband home from Russian captivity",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "BANGKOK -- A Myanmar military fighter jet crashed in a combat zone in the country\u2019s east, according to an anti-military resistance organization that claimed to have shot it down. State-run media reported about the disappearance of an aircraft.",
      "Maui, the vice commander-in-chief and Secretary No. 2 of the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force, or KNDF, told The Associated Press on Thursday that a jet had been shot down early Wednesday by the resistance fighters during heavy fighting near Hpasawng township in Kayah state, which is also known as Karenni.",
      "Hpasawng is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of the capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "Claims of aircraft being shot down are difficult to independently confirm, because of tight restrictions on the media and the remoteness of where much combat takes place.",
      "Maui said that the wreckage of the plane, along with the remains of the two pilots nearby, were found on Thursday morning, after a search was conducted. He also posted photos and video of the jet\u2019s smoking wreckage on a hill with the resistance fighters, including him, posing in the background. Local media also posted images of a crashed plane with what appeared to be human remains nearby.",
      "The claims that an aircraft had been shot down came a few hours after the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper on Thursday reported that the military fighter jet had suddenly disappeared from radar and lost communications during long-distance training maneuvers on Tuesday night, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Naypyitaw.",
      "The report said that it was possibly caused by a technical fault or bad weather, and a search and recovery effort was underway, without identifying the type of jet or mentioning casualties.",
      "The KNDF identified the plane as a two-seater Chinese FTC-2000G, a ground-attack jet. In a statement released on its Facebook page on Thursday, the resistance group said that the military has been launching heavy attacks with various fighter jets after the combined resistance forces seized an army infantry battalion in Hpasawng on Monday.",
      "Maui said that the plane could be the same one that the military had declared missing.",
      "Kayah, which is the smallest of Myanmar\u2019s seven states and dominated by the Karenni ethnic minority, has experienced intense conflict, especially since the army seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The area borders Thailand and isn't far from Myanmar's capital.",
      "The crisis has led to the growth of armed resistance and embroiled the country in a civil war. The military, which has launched offensives in various parts of the country, makes heavy use of air power, which can't be effectively challenged by the resistance.",
      "Most combat aircraft in Myanmar\u2019s military come from China or Russia, which also supply other armaments. Many Western nations maintain an arms embargo, in addition to other sanctions on the ruling military, and are making efforts to block the supply of aviation fuel.",
      "The military is believed to have lost at least five helicopters and four fighter jets, including two aircraft that crashed in May and June, which opposition groups claimed were shot down by them.",

      "The weekly session in which the British prime minister is questioned by lawmakers in Parliament can be an ordeal for the government leader",
      "LONDON -- The weekly session in which the British prime minister is questioned by lawmakers in Parliament can be an ordeal for the government leader. For Cabinet members, it\u2019s usually simply a matter of backing their boss.",
      "But on Wednesday the spotlight ended up on Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves during the Prime Minister's Questions session because it became evident that she was crying as she sat beside Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "It's not known what triggered the tears, later said to have been personal. They came as Starmer sought to fend off attacks that his year-old government was losing its authority and that he was about to fire Reeves to regain the initiative.",
      "Traders got spooked, with the interest rate charged on the U.K.\u2019s 10-year benchmark bond in the markets up sharply, and the pound down. The moves were a sign investors had lost confidence in U.K. financial assets.",
      "Reeves had become associated with fiscal discipline, in particular a rule of covering day-to-day government spending with tax revenue, said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "\u201cThe markets are concerned that if the Chancellor goes, such fiscal discipline would follow her out of the door,\" he added.",
      "With Starmer insisting Thursday that Reeves would remain in post, the markets calmed down.",
      "Prime Minister's Questions, or PMQs, can come as close to a gladiatorial contest as is possible in a modern legislative chamber. Very little deference is given to the man or woman holding the highest office in the land.",
      "The prime minister is considered the first among equals. Like all other members of Parliament, the prime minister represents one of 650 constituencies. And nowhere is that shared connection more noticeable than at noon every Wednesday in the House of Commons.",
      "Starmer stands for half an hour every week to be quizzed by friends and foes. He may get soft balls, but there's always a potential zinger around the corner.",
      "The leader of the biggest opposition party, currently the Conservative Party's Kemi Badenoch, has the best chance to knock the prime minister off course. With six questions, she can lay traps and go for the jugular.",
      "Typically it's more theater than substance, and the weekly shouting match is consistently the most-watched parliamentary event, viewed around the world, including on C-Span in the United States.",
      "This week's session appeared to have more at stake than usual following a chaotic run-up to a welfare reform bill. With scores of Labour lawmakers opposed, Starmer was forced to scrap key planks of the bill \u2014 at a cost, politically and economically.",
      "For a prime minister, with one of the biggest majorities in history, it was a sign of weakness.",
      "Many Labour MPs blame Reeves, for her rigid adherence to her budget rules.",
      "As usual, Starmer was flanked to his left by Reeves, who didn't look her usual self, clearly bloated around the eyes.",
      "Badenoch showed little mercy, describing Reeves as \u201cabsolutely miserable\u201d and a \u201chuman shield\u201d for Starmer. She asked Starmer whether he could repeat a pledge that Reeves would stay in her post until the general election, which has to take place by the middle of 2029.",
      "While praising Reeves' handling of the economy, Starmer didn't give that assurance, and it was around this point that Reeves wiped away a tear.",
      "\u201cHow awful for the Chancellor that he couldn\u2019t confirm that she would stay in place,\" Badenoch responded.",
      "Starmer's Downing Street operation faced questions over Reeves' teary appearance. Could it have been hay fever? Had Starmer told Reeves she would be fired for the government's recent woes, which has seen Labour's approval ratings slide?",
      "Starmer's press spokesman said it was a \u201cpersonal matter,\u201d insisted Reeves was \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d and had the prime minister's \u201cfull backing.\u201d",
      "Later, Starmer told the BBC that Reeves would be Chancellor for a \u201cvery long time\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d to suggest her distress was related to the welfare U-turn.",
      "Images of Reeves' agitated state were emblazoned across newspapers and remained a key item on the news agenda.",
      "Starmer repeated on Thursday that Reeves would remain Chancellor \u201cfor years to come\" and sought to explain why he hadn't comforted Reeves during PMQs.",
      "\u201cIn PMQs, it is bang, bang, bang,\" he said at an event where he and Reeves hugged. \"That\u2019s what it was yesterday and therefore I was probably the last to appreciate anything going on in the chamber.\u201d",
      "Reeves appeared more like her usual self.",
      "\u201cPeople saw I was upset, but that was yesterday,\" she told Sky News. \u201cI guess the thing that is different from my job and many of your viewers is that when I\u2019m having a tough day, it\u2019s on the telly.\u201d",

      "The 81-year-old-man died from smoke inhalation in a village near the town of Odemis, Suleyman Elban, the governor for Izmir province, said. His death marks the first fatality in a series of wildfires across the country that have forced thousands to flee.",

      "That wildfire, which began on Wednesday, forced the evacuation of three neighborhoods and closed roads. Television footage of the blaze showed flames burning through dried vegetation on both sides of a road.",
      "Elban said the wildfires in Izmir province are believed to have been sparked by electrical lines, which ignited dry grass and spread rapidly due to wind.",
      "Turkey has in the past week battled hundreds of fires across the country that were fuelled by fierce winds, scorching heat and low humidity. The fires, most of which have now been extinguished, led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.",

      "Denmark is launching its presidency of the European Union with a ceremony on Thursday in the western city of Aarhus",
      "AARHUS, Denmark -- Denmark launched its presidency of the European Union on Thursday with a call for Europe to unite to take on war in Ukraine and chaos caused by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariff hike which are likely to mark the Nordic country\u2019s six-month term at the helm of the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.",
      "\u201cWe have war on European soil. We face trade wars, and new tariffs, and we have our closest ally, in the United States, turning increasingly inward,\u201d said Danish European Affairs Minister Marie Bjerre. \u201cEurope can no longer be in the shadow of the United States. We need now to stand on our own two feet.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Mette Fredericksen and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were in the western city of Aarhus for a day of celebratory events as Denmark started its eighth EU presidency since joining in 1973.",
      "Presidencies rotate between the 27 EU member countries every six months. The nation in charge sets policy priorities and organizes the bloc\u2019s working agenda. It's supposed to act as an \u201chonest broker,\u201d setting aside national interests to foster consensus.",
      "Denmark is entering its term with the motto \u201cA Strong Europe in a Changing World.\u201d Its aim is to help ensure the EU can take responsibility for its own security, boost economic competitiveness and tackle climate change.",
      "The ceremony was held as large parts of Europe sweltered in high temperatures.",
      "Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, now in its fourth year, is seen as an existential challenge in Europe and will weigh heavily on most policy debate. Economic turmoil also lies ahead. Trump\u2019s 90-day tariff pause ends on July 9 with no EU-U.S. trade deal in place as yet.",
      "NATO has warned that Russia could be ready to attack another European country in 3-5 years. To prepare, the military alliance \u2014 most of whose members are EU countries \u2014 has agreed that national military and defense-related investment should rise to 5% of GDP.",
      "Denmark\u2019s priority will be to set Europe on track to properly defend itself by 2030. That will require laying the groundwork for countries to buy the military equipment needed to execute NATO\u2019s defense plans with Trump's security priorities lying outside Europe.",
      "That will mean wrapping up negotiations on proposals that will help countries purchase and make military equipment together.",
      "Helping Ukraine, but also Moldova, to join the EU soon is another security priority. Moldova has been shaken by Russian meddling in the form of energy coercion, election interference and disinformation campaigns.",
      "Denmark says it aims to keep the two moving toward membership together, but Hungary is blocking Ukraine's path. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n insists that Ukraine should remain a buffer zone between Russia and NATO countries.",
      "With fresh elections in Moldova in September, pressure is mounting for the EU to \u201cdecouple\u201d their accession tracks. Bjerre said \u201call political and practical means\u201d will be used first to persuade Hungary \u2014 a small EU country and the only one standing in Ukraine's way \u2014 to lift its veto.",
      "She said it\u2019s important to send clear signals to Balkans countries. Most have waited many years to join.",
      "As Trump wages tariff war, trade has changed drastically. The EU has sought new trade agreements with other countries, such as India, while other trade pacts are being revamped. Denmark says it's important to accelerate that process.",
      "The government in Copenhagen says it's also seeking to cut more bureaucratic red tape in order to speed up innovation.",
      "A major challenge looms in the form of the EU\u2019s next long-term budget. Von der Leyen plans to unveil the commission's blueprint for the seven-year spending package, which should enter force in 2028, on July 16.",
      "With defense spending increases weighing heavily on national purses, member countries are unlikely to want to stump up more funds for European priorities. Denmark\u2019s aim is to get the debate \u2014 which could run for two years \u2014 off on the right track.",
      "Despite some backsliding, the EU still holds to its goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, by cutting greenhouse gases and compensating for any remaining emissions. Denmark will lead work on setting a 2040 target to guide climate action and investment to keep the bloc on track.",
      "Part of that will be the transition away from fossil fuels to green energy forms. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has highlighted the dangers of energy dependence on any one supplier.",
      "Sanctions and political pressure have not stopped some EU countries of getting their oil and gas from Russia, although the level of dependency has dropped markedly since 2022. Denmark says the continued phase out remains a priority.",
      "Copenhagen also says it should be easier for farmers to respect EU rules. It wants the bloc\u2019s agricultural policy to be simple and business friendly. One goal is to finalize negotiations on a rule simplification package.",
      "In 2021, Frederiksen spoke of a vision of \u201czero asylum-seekers,\u201d and her government will continue down the EU track of seeking \u201cinnovative solutions\u201d to better manage migrants.",
      "Unable to agree how best to cope, EU countries have mostly focused on deporting people. They\u2019ve tried to establish \u201creturn hubs\u201d in countries outside the bloc where rejected asylum-seekers could be sent. That approach will continue. Denmark says it's important to persuade people not to set out for Europe in the first place.",
      "Work will also continue on preparing the vast asylum and migration policy pact to come into force next year. The pact was seen as the answer to Europe\u2019s migration woes, but countries still differ on how best to tackle the challenge.",
      "Under international law, people have a right to asylum if they fear for their lives, safety or persecution.",

      "The Fire Service and a civil protection agency issued mobile phone alerts for the evacuations and appealed to residents not to return to try to save their property.",
      "As fires crested ridgelines and edged toward residential areas, the blaze sent clouds of ash into the night sky, illuminated by the headlights of emergency vehicles and water trucks that lined the coastal road near the resorts of Ferma and Achlia on the southeast of Crete.",

      "Crete is one of Greece\u2019s most popular destinations for both foreign and domestic tourists.",

      "Wildfires are frequent in the country during its hot, dry summers, and the fire department has already tackled dozens across Greece so far this year.",
      "In 2018, a massive fire swept through the seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, trapping people in their homes and on roads as they tried to flee. More than 100 died, including some who drowned while trying to swim away from the flames.",

      "Dubai's 13,000 food and drink establishments go all out to attract customers in one of the world's most saturated dining markets",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- From suspended tables to underwater lounges, some 13,000 food and drink establishments in Dubai pull out all the stops to attract customers in one of the world\u2019s most saturated dining markets.",
      "They cater to all tastes and budgets. Some spots ladle out inexpensive biryani while others offer dishes dusted with edible gold.",
      "These are some of the ways the emirate is competing with its neighbors Saudi Arabia and Qatar for tourist dollars and, so far, it\u2019s beating them handily. Dubai has more restaurants per capita than any major city except Paris.",
      "But the city-state\u2019s booming restaurant scene is testing the limits of its growth-at-all-costs model, raising questions about how long Dubai can keep feeding its own ambitions.",
      "The competition is cutthroat, so presentation is key.",
      "\u201cGone are the days when it just tastes good,\u201d said Kym Barter, the general manager of Atlantis The Palm, a resort perched on a manmade archipelago that boasts more Michelin stars than any other venue in the Middle East.",
      "But dazzling Dubai\u2019s food bloggers \u2014 the most popular of whom have millions of social media followers \u2014 isn\u2019t enough. Staying afloat means battling high rents and winning over a diverse and demanding group of consumers.",
      "Dubai has roughly nine expatriate residents for every Emirati citizen. Most of its private sector workers are migrants on temporary contracts, and only Vatican City has a higher share of foreign-born residents.",
      "Tourists, in turn, outnumber locals about five to one by some estimates, and they spend lavishly. Visitors to Dubai drop an average of over five times more than those traveling to nearby Saudi Arabia or even the U.S., according to global restaurant consultant Aaron Allen.",
      "Dubai is \u201con the right path\u201d to becoming the world's food capital, said Torsten Vildgaard, executive chef at FZN by Bj\u00f6rn Frantz\u00e9n. The restaurant, which runs at more than $540 a head, was one of two in Dubai to nab three Michelin stars in May.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only seeing the tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s to come in terms of gastronomy here,\u201d Vildgaard added.",
      "With each new set of illuminated high-rises and hotels, another crop of eateries emerge, vying for patrons. The legions of construction workers powering Dubai\u2019s progress also need affordable options.",
      "That growth, propped up in part by investor pressure on some of the world\u2019s biggest chains to expand in Dubai, has created what some analysts warn is a bubble.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a publicly traded company like Americana, what are you supposed to do \u2014 just stop opening restaurants?\u201d restaurant consultant Allen said, referring to the Gulf-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and other big franchises.",
      "The frenetic expansion of Dubai\u2019s restaurant industry is part of a regional shift that has seen Gulf Arab states pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building out tourist destinations as they move away from hydrocarbons to diversify their economies. Saudi Arabia has a high-stakes, $500 billion project: a straight-line futuristic city called Neom.",
      "But, in a Muslim-majority region, the United Arab Emirates has gone to lengths that some consider too much of a compromise, including relaxing restrictions on alcohol that fuel its pubs and nightlife and other social reforms.",
      "The rapid development comes at a price. Dubai\u2019s restaurants have a high failure rate, industry veterans say, though local authorities don't say what the rate of closures is. In the downtown district and other prime areas, annual rents for restaurants can top $100 per square foot. That\u2019s on a par with some of the world\u2019s most expensive cities.",
      "Still, the emirate issued almost 1,200 new restaurant licenses last year, according to Dubai\u2019s Department of Economy and Tourism. The department declined to respond to questions.",
      "Empty tables during peak hours are common, even in top locations. Part of the problem, managers say, is that traffic congestion is so severe that convincing diners to drive out can be a tall task.",
      "\u201cI sometimes go, \u2018Do I go into the restaurant right now, because I\u2019m going to get into traffic?\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Waseem Abdul Hameed, operations manager at Ravi, a Pakistani family-owned eatery famous for its official Adidas shoe line and a 2010 TV feature from Anthony Bourdain.",
      "He knows restaurateurs who have had to shut up shop and others who are squeezed by slim margins and increasingly reliant on delivery apps, Hameed said.",
      "The demand sends fleets of migrant workers racing through gridlock on motorbikes, with few protections and tight delivery windows. Emirati newspaper Khaleej Times reported the accidental deaths of 17 Dubai food couriers last year.",
      "The math of Dubai\u2019s restaurant scene doesn't add up, delivery apps and wealthy tourists notwithstanding, restaurant consultant Allen said. He cited operating expenses that have more than doubled relative to sales since 2009, when a financial crisis almost hobbled the emirate.",
      "Too many Dubai entrepreneurs, he put it simply, have \u201ctoo much money, and they don\u2019t know what to do besides open restaurants.\u201d",

      "DHARAMSHALA, India -- The Dalai Lama has announced that he intends to reincarnate, paving the way for a successor to take on a mantle stretching back 500 years after his death.",
      "But as he approaches his 90th birthday, that news hasn\u2019t eased the worries of Tibetan Buddhists who wonder: What will happen when this Dalai Lama is gone?",
      "For decades, the 14th Dalai Lama has been more than a spiritual leader. He has sustained a nation in exile and managed to build a community that\u2019s kept the Tibetan culture and identity alive. He is the China -reviled spokesperson for a Tibetan homeland that many, like him, can see only from afar. He has received a Nobel Peace Prize and been courted by royalty, politicians and Hollywood stars, helping him draw global attention and support for Tibet.",
      "When his death comes, it will pitch the global Tibetan community into uncertainty, perhaps for years. His successor will have to be found through the traditional process of reincarnation. China, whose troops took control of Tibet in 1950, says it will reject anyone chosen without Beijing's consent.",
      "Tibetans in India\u2019s Himalayan town of Dharamshala, the Dalai Lama\u2019s home in exile, and scattered around the world fear a new onslaught on their cultural and religious identity.",
      "\u201cThe absence of His Holiness would be a huge setback for the Tibetans,\u201d said Penpa Tsering, the head of the democratically elected Tibetan government-in-exile. \u201cThe responsibility lies on us as to how we carry forward the legacy of His Holiness.\u201d",
      "The Dalai Lama has become one of the world\u2019s most recognizable figures while leading a Tibetan diaspora through their struggle for autonomy and opposition of China\u2019s control of Tibet. He has not named a successor, but he says they will be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d \u2014 outside China.",
      "Previous Dalai Lamas have been identified by senior monastic disciples, under strict religious rituals meant to identify their predecessor's reincarnation. Monks interpret signs, consult oracles and send search committees to Tibetan households looking for a child who exhibits the qualities of the Dalai Lama.",
      "All of this takes years of effort, leaving a leadership vacuum. Years of religious education and training are needed before the identified successor grows up and takes up full responsibilities as spiritual leader.",
      "China has already sought to elevate other spiritual figures, particularly Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s No. 2 figure, the Panchen Lama, whose legitimacy is highly contested by many Tibetans at home and in exile.",
      "Gyaltsen Norbu was installed by Beijing as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 after followers of the Dalai Lama recognized a different boy as the Panchen\u2019s incarnation. That boy disappeared soon after.",
      "And there\u2019s no guarantee the successor will have the current Dalai Lama\u2019s charisma, or his ability to balance a sense of joy with the stubbornness needed to counter China.",
      "\u201cHe is a fulcrum, he\u2019s the epitome of the Tibetan movement,\u201d said writer and activist Tenzin Tsundue, who was born in India.",
      "Tsundue for years has advocated for Tibet\u2019s autonomy. To him, the current Dalai Lama\u2019s absence will be hugely felt.",
      "Like many other Tibetans, however, his hopes are pinned on the government in exile. \u201cHow is home not anything but a genuine human demand?\u201d he added.",
      "Such concerns are most prevalent in Dharamshala, where a Tibetan community of over 20,000 administers its own schools, hospitals and monasteries and elects its own lawmakers and president. The Dalai Lama handed over his political powers to a democratically elected government in 2011.",
      "China doesn\u2019t recognize the Tibetan government-in-exile and brands the Dalai Lama a dangerous separatist. It has shunned direct contact with his representatives for more than a decade.",
      "It has insisted that the Dalai Lama\u2019s successor will be from inside China and must be approved by its government.",
      "Tibetans in exile have long been wary of the officially atheist Chinese government\u2019s attempts to meddle with the Tibetan Buddhism reincarnation system. They see it as part of Beijing\u2019s plan to tighten its control over Tibet.",
      "\u201cIf they do it, they are actually making a mockery of themselves among the free countries,\u201d said Geshe Lhakdor, a Tibetan Buddhist scholar, calling Beijing\u2019s stance \u201chypocrisy.\u201d",
      "Tibetans say they were effectively independent for centuries and accuse China of trying to wipe out Tibet\u2019s Buddhist culture and language. Many of the more than 7 million Tibetans living under Chinese rule accuse Beijing of stifling religious freedoms, changing its ethnic makeup by moving millions of Han Chinese into the region and torturing political prisoners.",
      "The Chinese government denies these allegations.",
      "For years, governments across the world have feted the Dalai Lama for advocating for Tibetan rights and spreading a message of nonviolence. They have also helped him raise tens of millions of dollars to build Tibetan cultural and religious institutions.",
      "But Tsundue said that global powers have become more unreliable in their support of the Tibetan cause as China\u2019s influence grows.",
      "\u201cEverybody has benefited at our cost because they have been trading with China,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cWe are, in a way, a victim of geopolitics.\u201d",
      "Some countries, including the United States, view Beijing\u2019s attempts to control the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama as a violation of religious freedom and Tibetan cultural tradition. Others, like the European Union and India, have maintained a cautious stance to avoid friction with China.",
      "Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, acknowledged this, calling Tibetans\u2019 efforts to keep the issue of Tibet alive \u201ca miracle.\u201d",
      "He also cautioned that the future depends on the Tibetan people at large.",
      "Under the Dalai Lama\u2019s \u201cMiddle Way\u201d policy, the movement for Tibet\u2019s autonomy has largely been nonviolent. It espouses autonomy under Chinese sovereignty.",
      "The newly announced succession plan, however, can prompt a reckoning of that policy, and it is unclear how the Dalai Lama\u2019s successor might approach dialogue with Beijing.",
      "Tsering cautioned that much could change in the coming years. His biggest worry is that the Dalai Lama\u2019s death in exile could trigger a violent response inside Tibet, where in recent years hundreds of monks and others reportedly set themselves on fire in protest against Chinese rule.",
      "\u201cI hope the Tibetans won\u2019t get radicalized,\u201d he said.",

      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung says that it remains unclear whether Seoul and Washington can conclude their tariff negotiations by next week\u2019s deadline set by President Donald Trump",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that it remained unclear whether Seoul and Washington could conclude their tariff negotiations by the deadline set by President Donald Trump for next week, noting Thursday that both nations were still working to clarify their positions and identify areas of agreement.",
      "Speaking at his first news conference since taking office last month, Lee also reiterated his intentions to improve badly frayed ties with North Korea, though he acknowledged that mutual distrust between the Koreas is too deep to heal anytime soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and other \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies are major challenges for Lee's month-old government, as are North Korea's advancing nuclear program and domestic economic woes. Lee, a liberal, came to power after winning a snap presidential election caused by the ouster of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol over his ill-fated imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Lee said the tariff negotiations with the U.S. have been \u201cclearly not easy\u201d and stressed that the countries must reach mutually beneficial outcomes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say with certainty whether we will be able to reach a conclusion by July 8. We are now doing our best,\u201d Lee said. \u201dWhat we need is a truly reciprocal outcome that benefits both sides and works for everyone, but so far, both sides are still trying to define exactly what they want.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s 90-day pause in global reciprocal tariffs is set to expire on July 9, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates.",
      "Washington has separately been seeking higher duties on specific products such as automobiles and semiconductors, which are key exports for South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy. There are growing concerns in Seoul that Trump may also demand a broader deal requiring South Korea to pay significantly more for the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country to deter North Korean threats.",
      "Lee has consistently urged patience on tariffs, arguing that rushing to secure an early deal would not serve the national interest. His trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, was reportedly arranging a visit to Washington for possible meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "On North Korea, Lee said he would seek to restore long-dormant talks with Pyongyang, whose expanding military cooperation with Russia pose major security concerns to their neighbors.",
      "\u201cI think we should improve relations with North Korea based on a reliable coordination and consultation between South Korea and the U.S.,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut I expect that won\u2019t be easy as mutual antagonism and distrust are too serious.\u201d",
      "Lee previously faced criticism that he was tilting toward North Korea and China and away from the U.S. and Japan. But during his campaign, Lee promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy, saying he would bolster the alliance with the U.S. while also seeking to repair ties with North Korea, China and Russia. Some critics say it\u2019s too difficult to satisfy all parties.",
      "Lee added that he had proposed resuming more frequent summits with Japan.",
      "Lee's government has made proactive efforts to build trust with North Korea, halting frontline anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts and taking steps to ban activists from flying balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border.",
      "Trump has also expressed intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Lee has said he would support Trump\u2019s push.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t publicly responded to the conciliatory gestures by Trump and Lee. But officials said North Korean propaganda broadcasts are no longer being heard in South Korean border towns.",
      "North Korea has refused talks with the U.S. and South Korea since earlier Trump-Kim nuclear talks collapsed in 2019. North Korea is now working to expand relations with Russia, supplying troops and weapons to support its war against Ukraine in return for economic and military assistance.",

      "Wednesday's sentence was the first in any case against Hasina since she fled to India during a mass uprising last year that toppled her 15-year rule.",
      "The contempt case stemmed from a leaked audio recording of a supposed phone conversation between Hasina and a leader of the student wing of her political party. A person alleged to be Hasina is heard on the audio saying: \u201cThere are 227 cases against me, so I now have a license to kill 227 people.\u201d",
      "The Criminal Investigation Department confirmed the audio's authenticity through forensic analysis.",

      "The sentencing by the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal came as a trial against her being held in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity began in June.",
      "The tribunal had ordered Hasina and her former home minister to respond by May 15. When they failed to do so, the tribunal summoned them May 25 to appear in court June 16. Later the tribunal asked for notices to be published in newspapers asking Hasina to appear.",
      "The prosecution said later neither of the suspects appeared before the court or explained their absence through a lawyer. In such circumstances, the tribunal has the authority to issue a sentence under the law.",

The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war against Pakistan.

      "\u201cThe ferry could not be contacted via radio from the beginning. Then it could be contacted by other ships from the same company. But the ship was already in a tilting condition,\u201d Sigit said.",

      "Survivors were taken to nearby medical facilities including Jembrana Regional Hospital in Bali.",

      "A court in Estonia says Russia's military intelligence service ordered an arson attack on a restaurant and supermarket there last year",
      "An arson attack on a restaurant and supermarket in Estonia last year were ordered by Russian intelligence, an Estonian court said Wednesday.",
      "The attack was one in a series across Europe tracked by The Associated Press and linked to Russia by Western officials. The goal, they asserted, is to sow division in Western societies and undermine support for Ukraine.",
      "The Harju County Court in Estonia said the perpetrators were two Moldovan men who are cousins, both named Ivan Chihaial. One was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for the arson attack on the restaurant and supermarket, which the court said was carried out on behalf of Russia's security services.",
      "The other Ivan Chihaial was an accomplice and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison.",
      "In a statement, the court said the first Chihaial was tasked with the operation by Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU.",
      "It said he carried out a trial operation on behalf of the GRU in January 2024, setting fire to a Co-op supermarket in the village of Osula in southeastern Estonia. The next day someone acting on behalf of the GRU tasked him with setting fire to the Slava Ukraina restaurant in the capital, Tallinn.",
      "Chihaial drove with his cousin to the restaurant on the night of Jan. 31, 2024, then they set fire to it and left Estonia. The court said Chihaial's cousin was unaware he was working for the GRU.",
      "The court said the defendants set fire to the supermarket and the restaurant by breaking a window, pouring in gasoline, placing a bag with a gasoline can inside and igniting it.",
      "Authorities in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland worked to detain the men who were apprehended in Italy before being sent to Estonia to face trial, said State Prosecutor Triinu Olev-Aas.",
      "The arson is the latest attack on Estonia since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In prior cases, Estonia suffered cyberattacks and the windows of cars belonging to a politician and journalist were smashed.",
      "Previous attackers have been recruited inside Russia, which shares a border with Estonia. The Estonian Internal Security Service said the fact that Russia's intelligence agencies used Moldovans who were sent to the country showed they are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit, including among dual citizens.",
      "Russia has been accused of a widespread sabotage campaign by Western officials since its invasion of Ukraine. As well as cases of arson, the attacks across Europe range from stuffing car tailpipes with expanding foam in Germany to a plot to plant explosives on cargo planes, hacking that targeted politicians and critical infrastructure and spying by a ring convicted in the U.K.",
      "President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has told the AP that the Kremlin has never been shown \u201cany proofs\u201d supporting accusations of a broader sabotage campaign and said \u201ccertainly we definitely reject any allegations.\u201d",

      "Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has pardoned 16 more prisoners, continuing his selective releases while also cracking down on dissent",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko announced pardons for 16 more prisoners on Wednesday, a gesture that comes as the unrelenting crackdown on dissent continues.",
      "The newly pardoned prisoners were convicted on a variety of criminal charges, including extremism \u2014 a charge often used against dissidents and government critics in Belarus. Human rights advocates welcomed the release of the prisoners, but stressed that it is taking place as more people are being arrested in politically driven cases.",
      "Last month, the Belarusian government pardoned and released 14 prisoners, but at least 60 more people were arrested on politically motivated charges, said Pavel Sapelka, a rights advocate with the Viasna human rights center, the country's oldest and most prominent rights group. Sapelka, in conversation with The Associated Press, compared the situation in Belarus to \u201crevolving doors, where new political prisoners take the place of those released.\"",
      "Mass arrests and convictions of government critics in Belarus have continued since 2020, when Lukashenko was handed a sixth term in office in an election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.",
      "Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in the biggest demonstrations that the country had ever seen. Authorities unleashed a violent crackdown, detaining and beating thousands and driving many more into exile abroad. The suppression of dissent drew international condemnation, and the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus.",
      "As of Wednesday, Viasna has designated 1,164 people behind bars as political prisoners. The number includes 38 journalists and the group\u2019s founder, Ales Bialiatski, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. At least eight political prisoners have died behind bars.",
      "Lukashenko, who in January secured another term in office in another election the opposition denounced as a sham, has recently been pardoning some political prisoners, seeking to improve ties with the West. In total, he has pardoned and freed more than 300 prisoners since July 2024, including some U.S. citizens and other foreigners.",
      "Last month, Belarusian authorities released prominent opposition figure Siarhei Tsikhanouski and 13 others and brought them to Lithuania. Their release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.",
      "Commenting on the high-profile release on Tuesday evening, Lukashenko said \u201cGod forbid\u201d those freed last month died behind bars. \u201cWe would have been blamed for doing it to them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it's politics.\u201d",
      "Sapelka told AP on Wednesday that there likely aren't any prominent dissidents among the 16 newly released prisoners.",

    "story": [
      "A rift has developed between Russia and Azerbaijan, which have had long political, economic and cultural ties",
      "Deaths of ethnic Azerbaijanis rounded up by police for decades-old murders in a Russian city. The crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet that Baku blamed on Moscow. Growing ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey, along with waning Russian influence in the troubled South Caucasus region.",
      "These are among the factors that have led to the escalating tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan, the oil-rich Caspian Sea country where President Ilhan Aliyev has been in power since 2003 -- almost as long as the 25-year rule of Vladimir Putin in Russia.",
      "Here is a look at the previously warm relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan and what has happened:",
      "Russia and Azerbaijan developed strong economic and cultural ties after 1993 when Aliyev\u2019s father, Heydar, who also was Azerbaijan\u2019s Soviet-era Communist boss, became president. Like Putin, the younger Aliyev has suppressed political foes and restricted independent media.",
      "Azerbaijan has bought oil and natural gas from Russia to meet internal demand while exporting its own energy riches to the West. Russia also has been the main market for Azerbaijan\u2019s fruit and vegetable exports. It also is a key transport corridor for Russia\u2019s trade with Iran and other partners in the Middle East.",
      "Azerbaijani businessmen control significant assets in construction, real estate, trade and other sectors of the Russian economy.",
      "Russia is home to a sizable Azerbaijani diaspora. A 2021 census listed about a half-million ethnic Azerbaijanis living in Russia, but unofficial estimates put that number as high as 2 million.",
      "Relations with Baku have become increasingly important for the Kremlin since it sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, especially as Turkey has become a key economic partner for Russia as it faced sweeping Western sanctions.",
      "Just before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, an open confrontation erupted between two of its former republics in the South Caucasus \u2014 Azerbaijan and its neighbor, Armenia. After years of fighting, Armenian-backed separatists won control of Azerbaijan\u2019s region of Karabakh and nearby territories.",
      "Russia claimed neutrality in the conflict even though it provided economic assistance and supplied weapons to Armenia that hosted its military base. Moscow cosponsored peace talks under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, but they didn't produce a deal.",
      "In 2020, Azerbaijan's military, bolstered by weapons supplied by ally Turkey, recaptured broad swaths of territory that were held for nearly three decades by Armenian forces. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.",
      "Azerbaijan reclaimed full control of Karabakh in September 2023 after a lightning military campaign. Russia, busy with its war in Ukraine, didn\u2019t intervene, angering Armenia's leadership that responded by scaling down its ties with Moscow and bolstering relations with the West.",
      "The victory in Karabakh has fueled Azerbaijan\u2019s ambitions and prompted Aliyev to take a more assertive stand in relations with his neighbors.",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet crashed while on a flight from Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya. Azerbaijani authorities said the jet was accidentally hit by fire from Russian air defenses, then tried to land in western Kazakhstan when it crashed, killing 38 of 67 people aboard.",
      "Putin apologized to Aliyev for what he called a \u201ctragic incident\u201d but stopped short of acknowledging responsibility. Aliyev, meanwhile, criticized Moscow for trying to \u201chush up\u201d the incident.",
      "In May, Aliyev declined to attend Russia\u2019s Victory Day parade in Moscow alongside other leaders of ex-Soviet nations. Later that month, a Ukrainian foreign minister visited Baku, a sign of closer ties with Kyiv.",
      "On June 27, police raided the homes of several ethnic Azerbaijanis in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, in what authorities said was part of an investigation into murders dating back decades. Brothers Huseyn and Ziyaddin Safarov died and several other ethnic Azerbaijanis were seriously injured.",
      "The bodies were sent to Azerbaijan, where authorities attributed the deaths to \u201cpost-traumatic shock caused by multiple injuries.\u201d The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office said the brothers were subjected to beatings and other physical abuse by Russian police.",
      "Azerbaijan responded by calling off previously scheduled Russian official visits and cultural events.",
      "On Monday, masked police stormed the Baku offices of Sputnik Azerbaijan, a Kremlin-funded media outlet, and arrested seven of its employees. Police also rounded up eight other Russian IT experts and other professionals, who were accused of drug trafficking and cybercrime. Images of the detainees, who didn't have any known criminal record, showed their faces were badly bruised. The images caused outrage in Russia where many hawkish commentators accused Azerbaijan of treating Russians as hostages and urged a tough response.",
      "Russia on Tuesday briefly detained the leader of the Azerbaijani community in Yekaterinburg for interrogation. A video on Russian social media showed special forces breaking the windows of his vehicle, dragging him and his son out, and making them lie face down on the pavement. A prominent member of the Azerbaijani diaspora also was arrested in Voronezh in southern Russia.",
      "Azerbaijan strongly condemned what it called \u201cthe demonstrative and deliberate acts of extrajudicial killing and violence\u201d by Russian police following the deaths in Yekaterinburg.",
      "After the arrests of the Sputnik employees and other Russians in Baku, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Azerbaijan's ambassador to protest \u201cthe recent unfriendly actions of Baku and the intentional steps of the Azerbaijani side aimed to dismantle bilateral relations.\u201d",
      "Azerbaijan shot back by summoning the Russian ambassador to demand a probe into the deaths, punishment for those responsible and compensation for the victims \u2014 steps it said were \u201ccrucial for eliminating the negative atmosphere in bilateral relations.\u201d It shrugged off Moscow's complaints about the arrests of Russians in Baku",
      "Aliyev discussed the tensions with Russia in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, an act that seemed designed to rile the Kremlin. Zelenskyy said he expressed support for Baku \u201cin a situation where Russia is bullying Azerbaijani citizens and threatening the Republic of Azerbaijan.\u201d",
      "Asked about the call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that \u201cUkraine will do everything possible to add fuel to the fire and provoke the Azerbaijani side to continue emotional actions.\u201d",
      "Peskov noted that the head of Russia\u2019s top investigative agency has been in contact with Azerbaijan\u2019s chief prosecutor. He wouldn\u2019t say if Putin would speak to Aliyev to defuse the crisis.",

      "Dri, a Capuchin friar, died Monday in the Argentine capital, where his funeral was being celebrated Wednesday, the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano said.",
      "Dri was made a cardinal by Francis in 2023 at the age of 96 in recognition of his lifetime of work hearing confessions of the faithful and dispensing merciful absolutions. Up until his death, he worked as the confessor at the Our Lady of Pompeii parish in Buenos Aires.",
      "Francis frequently referred to Dri during his pontificate and held him up as a model confessor for other priests, urging them to always be merciful in the confessional. For Francis, the sacrament of reconciliation was particularly important and he urged priests to always pardon those who seek forgiveness.",
      "He once quoted Dri as saying he was so willing to dispense absolutions because God himself \u201cgave me a bad example\u201d in forgiving all his sins.",
      "Pope Leo XIV, who was made a cardinal during the same consistory as Dri, issued a message of condolences Wednesday signed by the Vatican secretary of state. In it, he recalled Dri as a \u201cdevoted pastor, who was so dear to Pope Francis, and who for so many years gave his life to the service of God and the church as a confessor.\u201d",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for home shoppers facing rising home prices",
      "NEW YORK -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for potential buyers who have wrestled with rising home prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.67% from 6.77% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell to 5.80% from 5.89% last week. A year ago, it was 6.25%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "High borrowing costs are also putting pressure on the new home market. Last week, the government reported that sales of new U.S. homes fell nearly 14% in May from the previous month.",
      "Recent data suggests sales could pick up in the coming months, especially with the recent decline in mortgage rates. A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales rose 1.8% in May from the previous month and increased 1.1% from May last year, the National Association of Realtors said last week.",
      "There\u2019s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.33% at midday Thursday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "Mortgage rates have now fallen five weeks in a row, reflecting the recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates appears to have encouraged some home shoppers. Last week, mortgage applications rose 2.7% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "The recall covers certain Nissan Rogues between 2021-2024 model years and 2019-2020 Altimas \u2014 as well as a number of 2019-2022 Infiniti QX50s and 2022 Infiniti QX55s sold under the automaker's luxury brand, according to Nissan and documents published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week.",
      "The vehicles impacted carry specific \u201cVC-Turbo\u201d engines that may have manufacturing defects in their bearings, the NHTSA's recall report notes. This may cause engine damage and possibly lead to engine failure while driving, the regulator warns \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Engine bearing failures \u201care not typically instantaneous and tend to progress over time,\u201d the NHTSA\u2019s recall report notes. That means effected drivers may see multiple warning signs to look out for \u2014 including abnormal noises or malfunction indicator lights.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The decision by the United States to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine has come at a tough time for Kyiv: Russia\u2019s bigger army is making a concerted push on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and is intensifying long-range drone and missile attacks that increasingly hammer civilians in Ukrainian cities.",
      "Washington has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022. But the Trump administration has been disengaging from the war, and no end to the fighting is in sight, despite recent direct peace talks.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Ukraine\u2019s options following the U.S. pause of some arms deliveries:",
      "Amid recurring concerns in Kyiv about how much military support its allies can supply and how quickly, Ukraine has raced to build up its domestic defense industry.",
      "The country's output has gradually grown, especially in the production of more and increasingly sophisticated drones, but Ukraine needs to speedily scale up production.",
      "Crucially, some high-tech U.S. weapons are irreplaceable. They include Patriot air defense missiles, which are needed to fend off Russia\u2019s frequent ballistic missile attacks, but which cost $4 million each. That vital system is included in the pause, and many cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, could become increasingly vulnerable.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official said Thursday that Patriot systems are \u201ccritically necessary\u201d for Ukraine, but U.S.-made HIMARS precision-guided missiles, also paused, are in less urgent need as other countries produce similar assets.",

The real question now is how far the United States is willing to go in its reluctance to support Ukraine,\u201d he told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the subject.",

      "\u201cThere are enough missiles out there,\u201d he said, without providing evidence.",
      "He also stated that Ukraine has already scaled up its domestic production of 155 mm artillery shells, which were once critically short, and is now capable of producing more than is currently contracted. \u201cSupplies from abroad have also become more available than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Amid at times fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been enlisting greater European help for his country\u2019s arms manufacturing plans.",

      "Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July: getting all the gear needed to host a pool party costs less than it has in years, according to a market research company's preliminary data.",
      "The total price to buy beach towels, a beverage cooler, bathing suits and other accountrements of summer fun averaged $858 in June, the lowest amount for the month since 2020, consumer data provider Numerator said in an analysis prepared for The Associated Press.",
      "The finding from the firm's seasonal snapshot comports with broader economic measures indicating that U.S. consumers so far have not seen major impacts from President Donald Trump's vigorous application of tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. To see how prices are shaping up for the summer, the company looked at the average purchase price for 16 seasonal items typically made in China.",
      "Along with four towels, a cooler and bathing suits for two adults and a toddler, the hypothetical shopping list for a poolside gathering included a grill, four patio chairs, four cushions, a patio umbrella and four outdoor pillows. Recreation supplies included a cornhole set, two pairs of swim goggles, a set of diving rings, two beach balls and two pool floats or noodles.",
      "Leo Feler, Numerator\u2019s chief economist, offered a few theories for why buying all that stuff cost 11% less last month than it did in June 2023, when the average cost reached a high of $966, and 8.4% less than it did in June 2024.",
      "Wholesale suppliers and retailers that order from Chinese manufacturers may have imported too much stock while trying to stay ahead of high tariff bills, Feler said. As declining consumer confidence measures pointed to the possibility of weak sales, those businesses might have offered early discounts rather than risking their merchandise going unsold, he said.",
      "Given wide swings in Trump\u2019s trade posture toward China, retail vendors may have decided to absorb any initial tariff costs instead of trying to figure out how much more to charge their business customers, Feler said. The tariff rate on Chinese products soared to 145% in April before China and the U.S. reached a deal last month that brought the overall rate down to 55%.",
      "Suppliers often work on six-month contracts that are signed in January or February and again in June or July. That means many contracts for patio tables and chairs, for example, were signed before the White House included metal furniture in the aluminum or steel products that would be subject to a 25% tariff that went up to 50% last month.",
      "Customers who want to buy a new set of beach towels or to replace an old cooler still might want to hold off until August since prices will get lower in late summer, Feler said. But waiting until next year may prove costly, if the tariffs on products from China remain in place, he said.",
      "Just because preparing for a backyard bash might be comparatively less expensive right now, many economists and retail industry analysts still expect consumers to feel the weight of Trump's favorite trade negotiation tool. Shoppers are likely to see higher prices for back-to-school items starting in July and August, according to Feler.",
      "The time it's taking for the extra taxes on imports to reach stores could turn out like the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions that contributed to U.S. inflation in 2021 and 2022.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like there was a sudden surge,\" Feler said. \"It was a few prices increased here, then a few more prices, and a few other prices, and a couple more prices. And it started gaining speed.\u201d",

      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages.

      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",

A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",

      "Reporting in Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria was tough work for reporter Jane Ferguson",
      "NEW YORK -- Jane Ferguson has won awards for unflinching reporting from dangerous lands including Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. So she was unlikely to be intimidated by seeking financing for a new journalism platform, despite tough times for the news industry.",
      "\u201cIt's very high pressure,\u201d said Ferguson, founder of Noosphere. \u201cI'm used to pressure in the field.\u201d",
      "Started this year, Noosphere offers journalists a place to showcase work to consumers who are attracted by a more personal style of reporting than they'd normally see on traditional outlets.",
      "It's similar to Substack, with a twist. Instead of paying for feeds of individual journalists \u2014 the Substack model \u2014 people who subscribe to Noosphere for $14.99 a month get access to all of its journalists. There are 20 so far, expected to increase to 24 with the site's upcoming British launch.",
      "Noosphere \u2014 named to reference a state of consciousness advanced by Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 arrives at a time of flux in the news industry. Consumers are fleeing newspapers and television news and trying different approaches springing up in a new media world.",
      "Ferguson raised $1 million to get Noosphere off the ground and is about to announce an additional round of investment.",
      "Ferguson, 40, grew up in Northern Ireland, and was attracted to the high-stakes, high-risk world of international reporting. For CNN International and then PBS NewsHour, she worked largely alone, covering stories about famine and war crimes in South Sudan, the conflict in Syria and Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.",
      "The latter experience left her shell-shocked and heartbroken, wondering if she'd reached the end of that phase of her career. \u201cI had been on the road for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI was exhausted, and in some respects, burnt out.\u201d",
      "She settled in the United States, teaching \u2014 and learning \u2014 at Princeton. She took classes in entrepreneurship and built contacts in the business world. Ferguson knew how many of her former international colleagues had to hustle to find outlets for their work, and envisioned Noosphere as a landing spot. Her business partner, Seb Walker, worked at Vice Media, known for its strong international reporting before filing for bankruptcy in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt's gotten a lot harder to continue making a living doing this,\u201d said Matthew Cassell, an international correspondent whose credits include Vice. A member of Noosphere's inaugural class of journalists, Cassell has posted videos giving his perspectives on the Israel-Iran war, along with recent reporting from the West Bank.",
      "Shrouq Al Aila contributed video from Gaza, showing efforts to distribute aid as the sound of gunfire is heard in the background. Oren Ziv reported from a missile strike in Israel, walking through a hospital's shattered hallways to show the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a really high-quality reporter is Face-Timing you from the field,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwhich is really cool.\u201d",
      "News consumers, particularly young ones, are souring on more stilted, conventional television news reporting, said veteran journalist Kate O'Brian, who is on Noosphere's board of directors. \u201cThe stage has been set for an audience who wants to hear directly from the journalist,\u201d O'Brian said.",
      "Ferguson envisions a reporting staff that is roughly half international, half based in the United States. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza reports on Washington for Noosphere.",
      "Her biggest signing to date is former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd. He started a Sunday night show in June, with \u201cWar Room\u201d host Steve Bannon and Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, as his first guests. Todd has hired the former producer for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, a clue to his ambitions for an eclectic show interviewing interesting people from politics and business.",
      "\u201cJane's hard to say no to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cLike any smart executive, she knows what she doesn't know, and goes to find smart people who she thinks know more.\"",
      "Ferguson's bet is that audiences can only afford so many Substack subscriptions to individual journalists, and that Noosphere will offer access to more at a set price. She's also talked to news outlets interested in acquiring some of the reporters' work.",
      "The challenge to getting Noosphere established is an increasingly crowded marketplace, and several of her journalists aren't household names.",
      "Noosphere journalists are paid a percentage of subscription fees, and given a greater amount if a subscriber specifically cites that contributor's work in signing on. Ferguson will not say how many subscribers she has yet.",
      "\u201cSubstack created a market that did not exist before and I give them huge kudos for that,\u201d O'Brian said. \u201cThis is just a different way of approaching it.\u201d",
      "To succeed, \u201cyou have to offer a lot,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can't just offer one or two things. Every hot spot around the world, Noosphere will have journalists on the ground. They have a reasonable chance to be very successful in their lane. The question is how big the lane can get.\u201d",
      "Todd said Noosphere's advantage is that it has been created by reporters, a distinction from the lack of journalism experience found among executives in the business, he said.",
      "Ferguson, too, has wondered whether journalism can survive the diminishment or death of news organizations. \u201cThe solution for the problems of the industry are going to come from journalists and not media executives,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- An analysis finds that a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans, a sum that could be potentially managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.",
      "The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category that includes roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand \u2014 and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president.",
      "The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump\u2019s import taxes, contradicting his claims that foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.",
      "The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to instead schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would have faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.",
      "Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: \u201cEverything\u2019s going well.\u201d",
      "The president has indicated that he will set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. India and Vietnam have signaled that they\u2019re close to a trade framework.",
      "There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report that it expects companies to pass along 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses\u2019 inflation expectations to say that companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.",
      "The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest that the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted that companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and that wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins that they might need to spread the tariffs costs to their customers.",
      "The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday interview that the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.",
      "\u201cPeople who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Bessent said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
      "The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.",

      "President Donald Trump keeps saying that Republicans\u2019 mega tax and spending cut legislation will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump keeps saying that Republicans' mega tax and spending cut legislation will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits.",
      "It does not.",
      "At best, Trump's \u201cno tax on Social Security\u201d claim exaggerates the benefits to seniors if either the House or Senate-passed proposals is signed into law.",
      "Here's a look at Trump's recent statements, and what the proposals would \u2014 or would not \u2014 do.",
      "Trump repeatedly told voters during his 2024 campaign that he would eliminate taxes on Social Security. As his massive legislative package has moved through Congress, the Republican president has claimed that's what the bill would do.",
      "Trump said on a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\" that the bill includes \u201cno tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime.\u201d",
      "But instead of eliminating the tax, the Senate and House have each passed their own versions of a temporary tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and over, which applies to all income \u2014 not just Social Security.",
      "And it turns out not all Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction. Those who won't be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don\u2019t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.",
      "The Senate proposal includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65, contrasted with the House proposal, which includes a temporary deduction of $4,000.",
      "The Senate proposal approved Tuesday would eliminate Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.",
      "If passed into law, the tax deduction would last four years, from 2025 to 2029.",
      "The deductions phase out as income increases.",
      "Touting a new Council of Economic Advisers analysis, the White House said Tuesday that \u201c88% of all seniors who receive Social Security \u2014 will pay NO TAX on their Social Security benefits,\" going on to say that the Senate proposal\u2019s $6,000 senior deduction \u201cis estimated to benefit 33.9 million seniors, including seniors not claiming Social Security. The deduction yields an average increase in after-tax income of $670 per senior who benefits from it.\u201d",
      "Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation think tank, said conflating the tax deduction with a claim that there will be no tax on Social Security could end up confusing and angering a lot of seniors who will expect to not pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.",
      "\u201cWhile the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\u201d Watson said.",
      "The cost of actually eliminating the tax on Social Security would have massive impacts on the economy.",
      "University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits \u201cwould reduce revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase federal debt by 7 percent by 2054\" and speed up the projected depletion date of the Social Security Trust Fund from 2034 to 2032.",
      "Discussions over taxes on Social Security are just part of the overall bill, which is estimated in its Senate version to increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Administration officials have said the cost of the tax bill would be offset by tariff income.",
      "Recently, the CBO separately estimated that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.",

      "Martin Cooper changed the world when he pioneered the portable phone",
      "DEL MAR, Calif. -- Dick Tracy got an atom-powered two-way wrist radio in 1946. Marty Cooper never forgot it.",
      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",
      "Tabane Ciss\u00e9, who moved from Senegal to Spain in 2023, makes phone calls about investing Spanish earnings at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s all texts, or voice notes, with one exception.",
      "His mother doesn\u2019t read or write, but when he calls \u201cit\u2019s as if I was standing next to her,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cIt brings back memories \u2014 such pleasure.\u201d",
      "He couldn\u2019t do it without the cell phone. And half a world away, that suits Marty Cooper just fine.",
      "\u201cThere are more cell phones in the world today than there are people,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cYour life can be made infinitely more efficient just by virtue of being connected with everybody else in the world. But I have to tell you that this is only the beginning.\u201d",

      "The Wonsan-Kalma eastern coastal tourist zone, which North Korea says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the heart of leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s struggling economy. But prospects for the resort, the biggest tourist complex in North Korea, aren\u2019t clear, as the country won\u2019t likely fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon, observers say.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported the Wonsan-Kalma area began service Tuesday, drawing a large number of North Koreans who enjoyed open water swimming, slides and other attractions at a water park and various water activities in the area.",
      "\u201cThe guests\u2019 hearts were filled with overwhelming emotion as they felt the astonishing new heights of our-style tourism culture blossoming under the era of the Workers\u2019 Party,\" KCNA said in a typical propaganda-driven dispatch.",

      "Since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn\u2019t said whether and when it would fully resume international tourism.",
      "Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled while there are questions about ties between the two socialist neighbors. In February this year, North Korea allowed a small group of international tourists to visit its northeastern border city of Rason, only to stop that tour program in less than a month.",
      "Since February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid expanding military cooperation between the countries. But Russian government records seen by South Korean experts show a little more than 2,000 Russians, only about 880 of them tourists, visited North Korea last year, a number that is too small to revive North Korea's tourism.",
      "Russia\u2019s Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said last week that the first group of Russian tourists to the Wonsan-Kalma resort will depart on July 7 for a eight-day trip that includes a visit to Pyongyang.",

      "The White House said Trump's nominees for the federal utility are Tennesseans Lee Beaman, Mitch Graves and Jeff Hagood; and Randall Jones of Alabama.",

      "Less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories are just about everywhere these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Fashion \u201cdupes,\u201d or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles.",
      "In the latest example, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel.",
      "Across the retail industry, it\u2019s far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Herm\u00e8s' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There\u2019s a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas.",
      "It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday\u2019s complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful of companies have \u201creplicated or copied\u201d its apparel to sell cheaper offerings \u2014 including those popularized online through hashtags like \u201cLululemonDupes\u201d on TikTok and other social media platforms.",
      "For years, companies have rolled out a range of cheaper option for consumers to buy instead of pricey name-brands or designer labels \u2014 often through retailers' house or generic brands. Unlike more direct copies of the product with an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, \u201cpure\u201d dupes that just resemble certain features are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items.",
      "But the rising frenzy for dupes, particularly in the fashion space, signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing.",
      "Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Herm\u00e8s\u2019 coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item \u2014 sold by Kamugo, which doesn\u2019t appear to have its own website \u2014 was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a \u201cwirkin.\u201d Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart\u2019s site selling similar totes.",
      "While popular among shoppers, these kind of look-alikes can frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the \u201cwirkin,\u201d Herm\u00e8s Executive Chairman Axel Dumas shared his annoyance, for example.",
      "\u201cMaking a copy like this is quite detestable,\u201d Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was \u201cquite touching\u201d to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style \u2014 and that \u201cdifference in quality\u201d was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Herm\u00e8s.",
      "Alexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, said that \u201cthe term \u2018dupe\u2019 itself doesn\u2019t tell us much about legality,\" noting the word has also been used to describe more traditional counterfeits.",
      "But overall, dupes can move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly if a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original.",
      "\u201cWith fashion, in particular, we\u2019re going to get into some thorny questions,\" Roberts said. That includes what intellectual property rights exist and how enforceable they are, she explained, and whether there is actual infringement or if a product is just \u201cpositioning itself as a less expensive alternative.\u201d",
      "Often such disputes boil down trademark questions around consumer confusion or patented product designs. Several businesses have already put this to the test, but not always successfully.",
      "In December, for example, Benefit lost a lawsuit in California over E.l.f.'s $6 Lash \u2019N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit\u2019s $29 Roller Lash mascara. The judge\u2019s decision was \u201ca resounding win for us,\u201d E.lf. CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an E.l.f. product that\u2019s a much better value.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had \u201cunlawfully traded\u201d on Lululemon\u2019s reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement \u201cdirected to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.\u201d",
      "Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several products, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men\u2019s Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco\u2019s website showing the item priced at $19.97.",
      "Roberts said she was \u201ca little skeptical\u201d of some of Lululemon's claims, noting that the design patents in particular could be hard to challenge. And she pointed to Lululemon's asserting common law trade dress over a \u201ctriangle kind of shape in the crotch region\u201d of the ABC pants.",
      "\u201cMy first reaction as a trademark expert is that looks pretty functional,\u201d she said, and functional matter is not protected under trademark law. \u201cI was just cracking up because that particular claim seemed really far-fetched to me. Those pants look really basic.\"",
      "Still, Roberts noted that Lululemon had some plausible claims.",
      "Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't clearly reveal that information to customers. Due to this, Lululemon claims some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the \u201coriginal\u201d products.",
      "Roberts said this could rule in Lululemon's favor as something that \u201cweighs toward consumer confusion.\u201d Still, she noted that most of the products Lululemon mentioned in its complaint weren't sold under the Kirkland brand, which could undermine the argument.",
      "A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit.",
      "Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged \u201ccopycat products\u201d in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Just playing for the U.S. national team was a big opportunity for Claire Hutton.",
      "Then Canada left her a bit too much space at the edge of the 6-yard box \u2014 and Rose Lavelle found her with a perfect corner kick. The 19-year-old midfielder was ready.",
      "Hutton headed home her first international goal, and the Americans easily dispatched Canada 3-0 in a friendly Wednesday for their fifth straight victory. Sam Coffey and Yazmeen Ryan also scored.",
      "\u201cSet pieces are something we focus on. It's what we talk about,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cAt the international level, it's what sets teams apart, especially in big tournaments. So being able to get my head on Rose's perfect ball there was just amazing. Hoping for more in the future.\u201d",
      "The Americans have won five straight friendlies by a combined score of 18-0 since their 2-1 loss to Brazil in early April. The 19-year-old Hutton was making her sixth appearance for the national team, and her goal in the 36th minute gave the U.S. a 2-0 lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. To wear this jersey, wear this badge, it weighs a lot. I know the history behind it,\" said Hutton, who plays for the Kansas City Current. \"We talked about the U.S. legacy this past week. Just knowing that I get to be a part of it, it means the world to me.\u201d",
      "U.S. coach Emma Hayes gave many of her Europe-based options a break for this stretch of three games in seven days, which also included two 4-0 wins over Ireland. That left opportunities for less experienced players like Hutton.",
      "\u201cAs I've said many times, I'm all about improving the whole ecosystem. I think more opportunities for more players with the national team will improve the NWSL,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cBecause it gives players hope and belief that if they perform, that they're going to get an opportunity.\u201d",
      "The U.S. opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Lavelle delivered a free kick into the penalty area from near the left sideline. Canada\u2019s Janine Sonis tried to head clear, but the ball fell to Avery Patterson and then bounced to Coffey about 9 yards from the goal.",
      "Both Coffey and Patterson stabbed at the ball, and both appeared to make contact with it. It went straight into the net. Coffey was credited with the goal and Patterson with an assist.",

      "Lavelle received a standing ovation when she was subbed out around the midway point of the second half. The crowd also gave a big cheer when Tara McKeown \u2014 who plays locally for the Washington Spirit \u2014 came on as a late sub for the U.S. McKeown assisted on Ryan\u2019s goal in the 89th minute.",

      "Red Panda \u2014 her real name is Rong Niu \u2014 spent 11 hours in a Minneapolis hospital, with a pair of Lynx staffers there with her the entire time, agent Patrick Figley said. The Chinese American acrobat was heading home for treatment and recovery, which should take a few months.",

      "One tennis player's public lament about feeling alone after a loss at Wimbledon has revived the conversation about mental health in the sport",
      "LONDON -- When Naomi Osaka opened up about her anxiety and depression at the 2021 French Open, it sparked a conversation in sports \u2014 and society at large \u2014 about mental health and the importance of addressing such issues.",
      "In the time since, more and more players have spoken about the topic and seeking help, and whatever taboos there were seem to have faded. Still, the way three-time Grand Slam finalist Alexander Zverev discussed his state of mind after a first-round exit at Wimbledon this week revived the conversation.",
      "\u201cI feel very alone out there at times. I struggle mentally. ... I\u2019m trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way,\u201d said Zverev, who was the runner-up at the Australian Open in January but then went through a rough stretch of results this season when he had a chance to overtake Jannik Sinner at No. 1 in the rankings.",
      "\u201cI feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice,\" Zverev said. \"It\u2019s not a feeling on a tennis court, it\u2019s just a life feeling in general.\u201d",
      "Players at the All England Club were asked Wednesday about Zverev's words.",
      "They could empathize, some said.",
      "Others offered advice.",
      "Amanda Anisimova was a French Open semifinalist as a teen in 2019, then announced two years ago she was taking time off because of burnout. She's been back for a while now and reached the third round at Wimbledon with a victory Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely tricky. Each and every one of us goes through something at some point in our lives. We have our bouts of negative times. It honestly takes some self-reflecting, figuring out what\u2019s going wrong or how can I create a lifestyle that I enjoy. I feel like there are so many factors. For me, personally, it was finding people that I could confide in and I trusted. People that I could talk to,\" Anisimova said.",
      "\u201cWhat Alex said about feeling lonely ... a lot of people struggle with being lonely, especially on the pro circuit,\u201d she said, adding that taking a break from tour life \"really helped me and I'm happy I did that, because I came back with a new perspective, felt refreshed, and I feel like I learned a lot about myself.\u201d",
      "Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who owns three major trophies, said that she worked with a therapist for five years.",
      "\u201cIt's really important to talk openly about whatever you\u2019re dealing with. ... It\u2019s really important to be open and to talk about what are you experiencing, because if you\u2019re going to keep it inside, it\u2019s just going to destroy you. I think that\u2019s kind of like something happening to him,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cI think (Zverev) just needs to open up to whoever is close to him.\u201d",
      "At the Australian Open, title winner Madison Keys addressed her reliance on therapy and the ways in which it both allowed her to be happier, in general, and more successful at tennis \u2014 a sport in which losses are frequent and expectations can be a burden.",
      "\u201cOur identity becomes very wrapped up in being a tennis player. That\u2019s great, but when you have the tough kind of weeks, months, years on tour, that can really take a toll on how you think about yourself as a person,\u201d Keys, a 30-year-old American, said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSo being able to kind of dive into that and figure out how to separate the two and know that you\u2019re not just a tennis player, you're a full person that has all of these other really great attributes and other interests and just different things in your life.\u201d",
      "When a reporter asked the No. 3-seeded Zverev after his loss to unseeded Arthur Rinderknech on Tuesday whether he might consider trying therapy, the 28-year-old German replied: \u201cFor the first time in my life, I\u2019ll probably need it.\u201d",
      "This is how he described his current mindset: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It\u2019s not necessarily about tennis. Just lacking joy outside of tennis, as well.\u201d",
      "Andrey Rublev, a 10-time Slam quarterfinalist from Russia who is seeded 14th at Wimbledon, said after his win Wednesday that life on tour, in and of itself, is not the problem for someone like Zverev.",
      "\u201cTennis is just the trigger point,\u201d Rublev said. \u201cIt\u2019s something inside of you that you need to face.\u201d",

      "The PGA Tour is changing how it pays $100 million in bonus money for the FedEx Cup",
      "The PGA Tour has done away with the staggered start for the FedEx Cup finale. In its place is a new pay structure with staggered bonuses to whoever is leading at three points in the final month of the season.",
      "The FedEx Cup champion will get $10 million, down from $25 million. However, if the No. 1 seed would still get $25 million if he stays at the top throughout the playoffs.",
      "The bonus pool remains at $100 million under the structure released Wednesday.",
      "But instead of the FedEx Cup champion receiving $25 million at the end of the Tour Championship, the No. 1 player will get $10 million after the regular season ends with the Wyndham Champion. Whoever leads the FedEx Cup after the BMW Championship gets $5 million. And the Tour Championship winner gets $10 million.",
      "This caps an overhaul to what the PGA Tour hopes can lead to a more compelling \u2014 and less confusing \u2014 end to the season.",
      "The staggered start \u2014 also known as starting strokes \u2014 gave the No. 1 seed a two-shot lead at the Tour Championship by putting him at 10-under par before the tournament event started.",
      "Now the top 30 who reach East Lake will start even, just like any tournament, and whoever wins the Tour Championship is the FedEx Cup champion.",
      "To account for the winner-take-all nature of the Tour Championship, the pay structure was altered to make sure season-long performances were still rewarded, and top players did not get penalized too much for having a bad week at East Lake.",
      "Scottie Scheffler was so dominant last year he led the FedEx Cup all through the playoffs, picking up the $25 million bonus as the champion.",
      "If the new payment structure had been in place in 2023, however, Jon Rahm would have received $10 million for leading the FedEx Cup going into the playoffs; Scheffler would have won $5 million for leading after the BMW Championship; and Viktor Hovland would have won $10 million for being the FedEx Cup champion.",
      "Rahm was the No. 1 seed starting the 2023 playoffs, tied for 18th in the Tour Championship and his postseason payout was $675,000. Under the new payment plan, Rahm would have received $12,208,750 for his FedEx Cup bonus \u2014 No. 1 going into the playoff, No. 4 after the BMW Championship and a tie for 21st in the Tour Championship.",
      "The Tour Championship effectively would have a $40 million purse, but the bonus money still will count as unofficial.",
      "The FedEx Cup points for the FedEx St. Jude Championship and the BMW Championship will remain quadruple the value to allow for movement in the standings.",
      "The Comcast Business Tour Top 10 is still around, a $40 million bonus pool for the regular season. So for this year, whoever leads the FedEx Cup going into the postseason would get $10 million from the FedEx Cup bonus and $8 million from Comcast.",

      "Clayton Kershaw has reached an incredible milestone, becoming the 20th pitcher in MLB history to record 3,000 career strikeouts",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Clayton Kershaw was laboring in pursuit of his 3,000th strikeout. His pitch count soaring, he was down to the last batter he would face, needing one more swing and miss to become the 20th pitcher to reach the milestone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit harder when you\u2019re actually trying to strike people out,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI never really had to do that before.\u201d",
      "Kershaw accomplished the feat when Vinny Capra of the Chicago White Sox took a slider for a called third strike for the final out of the sixth inning on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cI made it interesting. Made it take too long,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t pitch that great tonight. The slider was so bad.\u201d",
      "In his 18th season in Los Angeles, Kershaw joined Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators and Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals as the only pitchers with 3,000 or more strikeouts all for one team.",
      "Freddie Freeman capped a three-run ninth by singling in Shohei Ohtani, giving the Dodgers a 5-4 win. Kershaw didn't get a decision.",
      "The sellout crowd of 53,536 was on its feet roaring as the 37-year-old left-hander walked off the mound to end the sixth. Kershaw paused and doffed his cap, with teammates briefly holding off hugging him to allow him to soak in the cheers.",
      "Kershaw waved to his wife Ellen and four children in the stands and then patted his chest and mouthed, \u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel bad for Ellen. I know she was nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI made her last six innings out there just stressed out that I wasn't going to get it and have to go to Milwaukee to do it.\u201d",
      "Kershaw shared a clubhouse toast with his teammates, coaches, training staff and front office executives.",
      "\u201cJust super thankful for tonight, super thankful for my teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cI told my teammates individual awards are great, but if you don\u2019t have anybody to celebrate with it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "The game was delayed for nearly 6 minutes between pitches, a gap that included a tribute video.",
      "Kershaw joined Justin Verlander of San Francisco (3,468) and Max Scherzer of Toronto (3,412) as the only active pitchers with that many. Kershaw is just the fourth left-hander in the club.",
      "\u201cIt's an incredible list,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's special to finally be in that group.\u201d",
      "Capra, hitting ninth, was retired on four pitches, with plate umpire Jim Wolf calling the third strike on a slider, Kershaw\u2019s season-high 100th pitch of the night. Wolf is the brother of retired pitcher Randy Wolf, once a teammate of Kershaw\u2019s.",
      "\u201cI wanted it to come easy,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cI would much rather have got it done in the first.\u201d",
      "Manager Dave Roberts had said before the game that he would manage the three-time Cy Young Award winner differently with the milestone within reach. That was apparent when Kershaw jogged out for the sixth to an ovation, having already tossed a season-high 92 pitches with just two strikeouts. He came into the game needing three to make history.",
      "\u201cI was going to give him every opportunity to do it at home,\" Roberts said. \u201cYou could see the emotion he had trying to get that third strike. It just happened the way it was supposed to happen.\u201d",
      "Kershaw retired Lenyn Sosa on three pitches for No. 2,999 in the fifth. Sosa fouled off Kershaw's first two pitches before ending the inning by striking out on a 72 mph curveball.",
      "In the third, Miguel Vargas took called strikes on his first two pitches before he swung and missed on another 72 mph curveball from his former Dodgers teammate.",
      "Chicago swung aggressively against Kershaw, who gave up a two-run homer to Austin Slater and two more runs as the White Sox led 4-2 after six innings.",
      "\u201cYou could just feel it. They wanted it for me so bad,\u201d he said of the crowd. \u201cYou could feel the tension. They were trying to will me to do it.\u201d",
      "Kershaw made history one batter after Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was injured in tagging out Michael A. Taylor on a steal attempt. Muncy had to be helped off the field, barely able to put any weight on his left leg.",
      "Kershaw has provided much-needed stability for the Dodgers\u2019 pitching staff, which has been decimated by injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just again a reminder for me, for anyone, to never bet against that guy,\u201d Roberts said before the game. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 health, stuff \u2014 he\u2019s going to will himself to doing whatever the team needs.\u201d",
      "Kershaw allowed five runs over four innings in his first start after returning from knee and foot surgeries last offseason. Since then, he has held opposing batters to a .222 average.",
      "\u201cThe first three months of the season, we\u2019ve needed some length from the starter,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cOnce he kind of got his footing after the first few, he\u2019s done everything and more that we\u2019ve needed. That doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "In his prime from 2010-15, Kershaw led the National League in ERA five times, in strikeouts three times and wins twice.",
      "Kershaw had one of the best seasons ever in 2014, when he finished with a 21-3 record, 1.77 ERA and 233 strikeouts to win both the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player in the National League.",
      "Age and less dominant stuff has changed the way Kershaw does his job. He knows his consistency isn\u2019t the same but with the depth of the team\u2019s staff, he doesn\u2019t need to be perfect every outing.",
      "Kershaw no longer overpowers hitters the way he did during the height of his career, but he remains stubbornly determined and possesses a craftiness honed over two decades as well as a slider that still can fool.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen him grow more than any player,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHasn\u2019t lost the compete, but I think that the world is not as black and white as he used to see it. I think that his edges are softer, I think that fatherhood, Father Time, does that to a person.\u201d",

      "A person with knowledge of the details says the New York Knicks have offered their coaching job to Mike Brown and are working to finalize a deal with the two-time NBA Coach of the Year",
      "NEW YORK -- The New York Knicks have offered their coaching job to Mike Brown and are working to finalize a deal with the two-time NBA Coach of the Year, a person with knowledge of the details said Wednesday.",
      "Brown would replace Tom Thibodeau, who was fired last month despite leading the Knicks to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years.",
      "Brown had his second interview with the Knicks on Tuesday before the job was offered, the person told The Associated Press.",
      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the search were to remain private.",
      "The plan to hire Brown was first reported by ESPN.",
      "Brown earned his second award as the NBA's top coach after leading Sacramento to the playoffs in 2022-23 \u2014 ending what was the league's longest postseason drought with its first appearance since 2006 \u2014 but the Kings fired him nearly halfway through last season.",
      "He would take over a Knicks team that believes it can contend for the NBA title and made it clear that was the only goal when it made the surprising decision to fire Thibodeau, who like Brown is a two-time winner of the NBA's Coach of the Year award.",
      "The Knicks quickly identified Brown as a candidate they wanted to speak with, while also discussing the job with former Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins and current assistants James Borrego of New Orleans and Micah Nori of Minnesota before offering the position to Brown.",
      "Brown was honored with his first coaching award when he coached the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team he led to the NBA Finals in 2007 during his first stint with the organization. He also coached the Los Angeles Lakers and is 454-304 in his career.",
      "Brown also won four championships as an assistant coach, three with the Golden State Warriors and one under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio.",
      "His coaching staff will be discussed in the coming days, the person told AP.",
      "Thibodeau led the Knicks to their only sustained success of the 2000s, with four playoff appearances in his five seasons. They reached at least the East semifinals each of the last three seasons and reached 50 wins in both of the last two.",

      "While he had to face another eight break points along the way \u2014 saving all but two \u2014 it was a considerably smoother win than his 4\u00bd hour, five-set victory over Fabio Fognini in the opening round.",

      "Instead, his future seems very uncertain.",
      "He's a free agent and facing some serious off-court issues \u2014 including being part of an investigation surrounding what's believed to be unusual betting patterns on games and now some unrelated legal matters involving his personal finances.",
      "Beasley was a key part of the Detroit Pistons this past season, averaging 16.3 points per game for a team that made the playoffs and was one of the feel-good stories in the NBA \u2014 winning 44 games after winning only 14 in the previous season.",
      "Some questions and answers about Beasley's current situations and his future:",
      "Beasley has not been charged with any crime. Federal investigators, who have not commented publicly, are looking into betting patterns surrounding some games Beasley played in during the 2023-24 season when he was with the Milwaukee Bucks.",
      "The primary focus of the probe is what are called \u201cprop bets,\u201d ones where bettors can wager if a player will go over or under a certain statistical total \u2014 like will he score more than 10.5 points, grab 5.5 or more rebounds, that sort of thing.",
      "It is similar to other investigations \u2014 such as the one that led to the banning of then-Toronto player Jontay Porter from the league. Terry Rozier, who plays for the Miami Heat, was a subject of a similar probe surrounding part of his time with the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier was never charged and never faced any penalty from the NBA.",
      "ESPN reported that one game in question surrounded Beasley's performance on Jan. 31, 2024, and in particular whether he would get more or less than 2.5 rebounds. Bettors, ESPN was told, wagered large sums that he would not get that many rebounds. But Beasley got six rebounds that night, meaning those \u201cunder\u201d bets did not pay out.",
      "News of the gambling probe broke on Sunday, followed by news of lawsuits two days later \u2014 including one brought by a sports representation agency that is seeking more than $2 million in damages.",
      "That suit, brought by Hazan Sports Management Group, says Beasley breached his contract and failed to fully repay a $650,000 advance, among other issues. Beasley and that agency parted ways in recent months, even though it negotiated a $6 million contract for him to play with the Pistons this past season.",
      "\u201cI have been with Malik for a long time, I have seen a lot of people around him come and go, but I have stayed away from any of his financial management or mismanagement or decisions he would make with money,\u201d Beasley\u2019s criminal defense lawyer, Steve Haney, told The Detroit News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m his lawyer. I don\u2019t get involved in his finances,\u201d Haney told the newspaper. \u201cYou hope to get them around the best business people and planners and management people. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Other issues that were revealed were issues with rent payments, along with a settlement with a dentist and even a barber who works with a number of NBA players.",
      "The NBA has seen a huge spike in dependency on the 3-point shot in recent years, and Beasley \u2014 who made 319 of them this past season, one back of Minnesota's Anthony Edwards for the most in the league \u2014 is an elite 3-point shooter.",
      "Only two players have made more than 1,000 3s over the last four seasons. Golden State's Stephen Curry, the league's all-time 3-point king, is one. Beasley is the other.",
      "This means Beasley should be in high demand, given the fact that he has a skill all teams crave. And the Pistons, according to a person with knowledge of the talks, were prepared to offer Beasley a three-year contract to stay. But given the seriousness of the issues that have come up in recent days, those talks cooled.",
      "On Tuesday, Detroit struck a deal to bring in former Miami guard Duncan Robinson \u2014 another elite 3-point shooter \u2014 after striking a three-year deal.",
      "Beasley is a free agent, meaning he can sign with any team. Outside of the off-court concerns, here's another problem: Very few teams have the means available under the salary cap to give a new player a contract in the range of what Beasley would be worth, which is probably in the $15 million annually range.",
      "He may have to accept something much, much smaller \u2014 possibly even a minimum deal of about $3 million \u2014 to have a chance with a team next season.",

      "Aryna Sabalenka has come back after being two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home.",
      "Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Zheng Qinwen and No. 9 Paula Badosa. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players \u2014 10 women, 13 men \u2014 were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years.",
      "\u201cOf course you're going to know the overall picture. ... I hope it\u2019s no upsets anymore in this tournament,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said afterward with a chuckle. \"If you know what I mean.\u201d",
      "She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month \u2014 drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week \u2014 but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club.",
      "A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder.",
      "On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C).",
      "At Centre Court, the 48th-ranked Bouzkova went ahead 6-5 in the first set with the match's initial service break thanks to a double-fault by Sabalenka. Bouzkova served for that set, and was two points away from it at 30-15 in that game, again at 30-all, then once more at deuce.",
      "But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout.",
      "\u201cThat was a tough moment,\" said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. \u201cUntil that point, (my) return wasn\u2019t great enough to break her serve. I'm really glad ... everything clicked together and I was able to break her back. I kind of like felt a little bit better.\u201d",
      "That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that.",
      "Sabalenka compiled a 41-17 edge in winners while making only 18 unforced errors in a match that lasted a little more than 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men.",
      "Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 major championships at Wimbledon will lead off the Centre Court schedule on Day 4 against Britain's Dan Evans at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), followed by Iga Swiatek vs. Caty McNally, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. Aleksandar Vukic.",

      "Buffalo Bills first-round draft pick Maxwell Hairston faces a lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault in 2021",
      "BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills first-round draft pick Maxwell Hairston was accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting a woman in 2021 at the University of Kentucky.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Kentucky by a woman who claims Hairston entered her dorm room without being invited, ignored her when she said didn't want to have sexual intercourse, forcibly removed her bottoms and sexually assaulted her. The Associated Press does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.",
      "Texts seeking comment Wednesday were sent to agents for Hairston.",
      "The Bills had no comment and referred to statements made by general manager Brandon Beane in April during the draft. Beane said at the time the team had \u201cfully investigated\u201d a sexual assault allegation from 2021 involving Hairston, who he called \u201can impeccable kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s unfortunate when things like that are attached to someone\u2019s name. And in this case, doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there,\u201d Beane said.",
      "Hairston is from West Bloomfield, Michigan, and spent three seasons playing at Kentucky (2022-\u201924) before being selected by the Bills in the first round \u2014 30th overall \u2014 of the NFL draft in April. The 21-year-old Hairston is being given the opportunity to win a starting job at cornerback this season.",
      "The Bills have been off since completing their mandatory practices in mid-June, and return later this month for the start of training camp.",

      "The league is aiming to play its first season with six teams starting in spring 2026. The tryouts, which will be held Aug. 22-25, will determine the 150 players who will be invited to the league's draft in October.",
      "More than 600 players registered for the four-day camp, the WPBL said. The first three days will include drill-focused sessions, athletic performance testing and player evaluations at the Nationals' Youth Baseball Academy before an initial round of cuts. Players will then compete in a live game at Nationals Park on Aug. 25, after which the final cuts will happen.",
      "Team USA women\u2019s baseball star Alex Hugo, who is a special adviser to the league, will lead the tryouts.",
      "\u201cWe are really excited to see all of the players at tryouts this summer and see their incredible skills,\u201d Hugo said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re building a future where girls and women who love baseball can dream as big as they want and now, finally, have a league to call their own.\u201d",
      "The WPBL was co-founded by Justine Siegal, who is the first woman to coach for an MLB team. When it debuts, it will be the first pro league for women since the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League \u2014 the one immortalized in \u201cA League of Their Own\u201d \u2014 dissolved in 1954.",
      "As it nears its launch, the WPBL has already struck a media deal with Fremantle, the production company behind shows like \u201cThe Price Is Right\" and \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d as well as brought in global women's sports investor Assia Grazioli-Venier as its chair.",

      "The British and Irish Lions have surged to a 52-12 victory over the Queensland Reds to make it back-to-back wins in Australia",
      "BRISBANE, Australia -- Maro Itoje bounced over to score beside the posts to trigger another second-half surge from the British and Irish Lions, setting up a 52-12 win over the Queensland Reds on Wednesday.",
      "The Lions are now two from two in five days in Australia after a 54-7 tour-opening win over Western Force in Perth on the weekend.",
      "On a cool, windy night in Brisbane, the Lions again took a while to get started, twice falling behind to early tries before turning a 12-7 deficit into a 21-12 halftime lead.",
      "Skipper Itoje, who was rested for the first game, ran powerfully onto an inside pass from scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park five minutes after the break to crack the game open, with the Lions scoring three tries in 15 minutes.",
      "The Lions were determined to play with pace and high-tempo, spreading the ball to the edges regularly and maintaining a positive attacking shape to generate space and scoring opportunities.",
      "\u201cAs a team we just wanted to be better today, take a step forward. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a step in the right direction,\u201d Itoje said of his first win as Lions captain. \"I think we were a little bit more clinical, sharper, a little bit more accurate on the ball.",
      "\u201cWe still made quite a few errors ball in hand, but I thought it was better in that regard.\u201d",
      "Flyhalf Finn Russell again orchestrated the Lions attack before he was rested after 55 minutes.",
      "Winger Tommy Freeman was a beneficiary of the attacking mindset, scoring two tries, while Bundy Ake created opportunities in midfield and openside flanker Jac Morgan put in a player-of-the-match performance in a dominant forward pack, including a try.",
      "Huw Jones plucked an attempted chip kick out of the air and sprinted 60 meters to make it 47-12 and Garry Ringrose capped it off with a try five minutes into stoppage time.",
      "The Lions have now won back-to-back matches after slipping to a 28-24 loss to Argentina in a warmup in Dublin before traveling to Australia for a nine-game tour, which includes three tests against the Wallabies on July 19, 26 and Aug. 2.",
      "The Lions will play New South Wales on Saturday in Sydney.",
      "\u201cWe have five games in two weeks. We don\u2019t have loads of time on the training field but what we do have is loads of games,\u201d Itoje said. \u201cYou improve and you learn probably more so in games than you do in training, so it\u2019s a blessing in disguise.\u201d",
      "Irish fullback Hugo Keenan was ruled out just ahead of the match and replaced by Elliot Daly, who scored two tries in the win over Western Force. Daly hurt his left forearm in a tackle late in the second half and didn't finish the match.",
      "Head coach Andy Farrell said Daly would undergo medical scans on the injury.",
      "The Reds stunned the Lions with an early try and twice led in the first half.",
      "Prop Jeff Toomaga-Allen powered through the defense and reached over to score the opener in the ninth minute after a strong break by center Hunter Paisami.",
      "Ake was held up over the line at the back of a driving maul from a lineout in the 12th minute, and the Lions again went close to scoring in the 16th until Daly's last pass went astray with the tryline open.",
      "The pressure paid off in the 20th when the Lions created an overlap and spread the ball wide for Freeman to score untouched.",
      "The Reds, playing in maroon and navy colors, were missing a host of starting players on duty for Australia's test against Fiji on Sunday, but still threatened regularly.",
      "Center Josh Flook swooped onto a short, stabbed grubber kick from scrumhalf Kalani Thomas as the Lions defense rushed up, collected the half-volley and dived over to give the Reds a 12-7 lead after 25 minutes.",
      "The Lions went within inches of scoring two minutes later but couldn't ground the ball. There was no doubt over prop Andrew Porter's barging try from close range in the 29th, though, and the Lions regained the lead 14-12.",
      "The Lions took a quick tap in the 35th after the Reds were penalized for a hand in the scrum and spread it wide quickly for Duhan van der Merwe to dive inside the left corner post. It was all the Lions after that.",

      "Yashasvi Jaiswal was 62 not out, after Lokesh Rahul chopped on to his stumps on 2 early on, and Karun Nair was out minutes before lunch when he picked out second slip.",
      "Rahul's wicket was reward for England's tight bowling on a dry, batter-friendly pitch under sunny skies.",
      "Then Nair's ambition sparked Jaiswal out of uncharacteristic caution and they accelerated to hit 16 boundaries in a stand of 80 runs off 90 balls.",

      "Captain Shubman Gill was with Jaiswal on 1.",

      "He got Rahul out and had big lbw shouts against Jaiswal on 12 and Nair on 5. Both times the ball was tracking to clip the top of off stump but the batters survived on umpire calls.",

      "His rising confidence brought out his imagination, including an overhead volley smash of Stokes to the boundary. He brought up his 50 with his 10th boundary \u2014 an overhead cut, on his toes, off Tongue. His 16th 50-plus score in his 21st test came off 58 balls.",
      "Nair fell softly after a bowling change and the return of Brydon Carse.",

India became the first side to lose a test after hitting five centuries.",
      "Bumrah was replaced by Akash Deep.",

      "TOKYO -- Plans to demolish a historic baseball stadium where Babe Ruth played and an adjacent rugby venue are at the heart of a disputed park redevelopment in Tokyo that critics say trades history and greenery for commercial space.",
      "The plan to remake the Jingu Gaien park area was approved 2 1/2 years ago by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Work clearing land has begun but opponents are still trying to stop the project, which could take a decade to complete.",
      "A coalition on Wednesday presented an open letter to Toshiko Abe, the minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, asking the project be reassessed.",
      "It's signed by 368 experts \u2014 urban planners, architects and environmental scientists \u2014 and 1,167 others.",
      "The park area was established a century ago through public donations to honor the Meiji Emperor. At the heart of the issue is citizens' control of public space, and a potential conflict of interest with private developers and politicians deciding how valuable parcels are used.",
      "The stadium oozes history and critics say building skyscrapers in the park space would never be allowed in Central Park in New York or Hyde Park in London.",
      "Ruth and Lou Gehrig played at the stadium on a 1934 barnstorming tour. Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami was inspired to write his first novel while drinking beer and watching a game there in 1978. The stadium is still home to the Yakult Swallows baseball team and hosted a concert this week.",
      "Plans call for developers to build a pair of 200-meter (650-feet) towers and a smaller tower. The stadiums are to be rebuilt in the reconfigured space with the baseball stadium going where the rugby stadium now stands.",
      "The open letter is critical of so-called private finance schemes that give private developers access to park space. Hibiya Park is Tokyo's oldest public park, another example of this approach.",
      "Opposition to the Jingu redevelopment has included novelist Murakami, a conservancy group, and botanists and environmentalists who argue the sprawling project threatens 100-year-old gingko trees that grace the area's main avenue.",
      "A global conservancy body ICOMOS, which works with the United Nations body UNESCO, has said the development will lead to \u201cirreversible destruction of cultural heritage\u201d with trees and green space being lost.",

      "He said \u201ccompanies with political power try to maximize their short-term profits without consideration of Tokyo's attractiveness (history, culture), inhabitants' well-being and future generations.\u201d",
      "Zoning changes to allow high-rise buildings in the area were made around 2013 by the Tokyo government when the city won the bid for the 2020 Olympics. Many of those changes permitted building the neighboring National Stadium but also applied to the park area.",
      "\u201cThe process of rezoning the area lacked transparency and democratic procedure and constitutes an illegal abuse of the governor\u2019s discretion in urban planning decisions,\u201d the open letter said.",
      "The Jingu district was considered \u201ccommon property\u201d until after World War II when the government sold it to Shinto under a promise it would remain a common space.",
      "The national government comes into play because the rugby venue is the property of the Japan Sport Council, a national government affiliated body. The rugby venue represents about 30% of the Jingu Gaien area.",
      "Opponents hope the timing later this month of a national election might aid their cause with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba heading a minority government.",
      "Former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has ties to the rugby venue.",
      "In addition to serving two decades ago as prime minister, he is the former president of the Japan Rugby Football Union and also served as the president of the 2020 Olympic organizing committee until he was forced to resign after making sexist comments about women.",
      "Opened in 1926, developers argue the baseball stadium is too old to save. However, Fenway Park in Boston dates from 1912 and Wrigley Field in Chicago from 1914. Both have been refurbished and are among the most venerated in the United States.",
      "Meiji Kinenkan, a historic reception hall in Jingu Gaien, dates from 1881 and is still widely used with no calls for its demolition. Mitsui Fudosan\u2019s headquarters building in Tokyo dates from 1929. Koshien Stadium, located near Osaka, was built in 1924 and has been in use since a refurbishment.",

One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology",
      "The startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.",
      "Formed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.",
      "But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.",
      "Jimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.",
      "\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d",
      "Gigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.",
      "The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.",
      "Gigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.",
      "Carbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.",
      "Only a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.",
      "The credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.",
      "And it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.",
      "The startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.",
      "Shaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Under his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.",
      "Chief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.",
      "Markus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.",
      "\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "A spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d",
      "The company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.",
      "In social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d",
      "The particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.",
      "\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Algae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.",
      "The ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Gigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.",
      "Later, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.",
      "While Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "Documents provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.",
      "In the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.",
      "A patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.",
      "Without specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.",
      "When asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.",
      "The company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.",
      "Shaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.",
      "\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Buesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.",
      "\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Several scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.",
      "The success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.",
      "Thomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.",
      "It\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.",
      "\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d",
      "The rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.",
      "It\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.",
      "Boyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.",
      "\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.",
      "James Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.",
      "The company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.",
      "In a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.",
      "Whether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.",
      "Puro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.",
      "Amid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.",
      "The Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.",
      "In part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.",
      "But the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.",
      "In June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.",
      "Marianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.",
      "But like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.",
      "Pallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.",
      "Pallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.",
      "How authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.",
      "More than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.",
      "Iron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.",
      "The startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.",
      "\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "But the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.",
      "Other scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d",
      "For now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.",
      "\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "The harmless object is currently near Jupiter hundreds of millions of miles (kilometers) away and moving toward Mars, but it should get no closer to the sun than that, according to scientists.",
      "It's too soon to know whether the object, designated for now as A11pl3Z, is a rocky asteroid or a icy comet, or how big and what shape it is. More observations are needed to confirm its origins. NASA said it is monitoring the situation.",

      "Shriners Children's operates 17 hospitals in the United States and one each in Mexico and Canada, plus clinics. The system is owned by Shriners International, a Masonic order. It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",
      "The institute projects it will have 470 employees, many of them new hires, and Georgia Tech said it will be the largest tenant at Science Square. That is a mixed-use development that Georgia Tech is developing along with the Trammell Crow Co.",
      "Georgia Tech owns the land adjoining its campus near downtown Atlanta, while the company built labs that opened last year. The development aims to emulate Georgia Tech's success in joint developments with technology companies in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood. That tech sector has been a major driver of growth in Atlanta in recent years, and officials are now trying to bolster growth from biomedical research.",
      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to really help embed some of their researchers here with Georgia Tech, to walk across campus, to work in the same labs, to have that physical presence together,\u201d West said. \u201cI think we can accomplish great things by doing that.\u201d",
      "The state and local governments are providing incentives to Shriners Children\u2019s, although it is not exactly clear how that would work because nonprofits are generally exempt from income and property taxes. In Georgia, nonprofit organizations do have to pay sales taxes, which means the state could waive such taxes on equipment purchases. Jessica Atwell, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said the state won\u2019t release documents until they are finalized.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient DNA has revealed a genetic link between the cultures of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Researchers sequenced whole genomes from the teeth of a remarkably well-preserved skeleton found in a sealed funeral pot in an Egyptian tomb site dating to between 4,495 and 4,880 years ago.",
      "Four-fifths of the genome showed links to North Africa and the region around Egypt. But a fifth of the genome showed links to the area in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization flourished.",
      "\u201cThe finding is highly significant\" because it \u201cis the first direct evidence of what has been hinted at\u201d in prior work,\u201d said Daniel Antoine, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum.",
      "Earlier archeological evidence has shown trade links between Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as similarities in pottery-making techniques and pictorial writing systems. While resemblances in dental structures suggested possible ancestral links, the new study clarifies the genetic ties.",
      "The Nile River is \u201clikely to have acted as an ancient superhighway, facilitating the movement of not only cultures and ideas, but people,\u201d said Antoine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeleton was found in an Egyptian tomb complex at the archaeological site of Nuwayrat, inside a chamber carved out from a rocky hillside. An analysis of wear and tear on the skeleton \u2014 and the presence of arthritis in specific joints \u2014 indicates the man was likely in his 60s and may have worked as a potter, said co-author and bioarchaeologist Joel Irish of Liverpool John Moores University.",
      "The man lived just before or near the start of ancient Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified as one state, leading to a period of relative political stability and cultural innovation \u2014 including the construction of the Giza pyramids.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away.",
      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",
      "\u201cThe numbers weren\u2019t as bad as thought with all the analyst forecast cuts we saw over the past week,\u201d said Morningstar's Seth Goldstein, though he added the report overall showed the company faces big challenges. \u201cThe current product lineup is at market saturation and Tesla will need the new affordable vehicle to grow deliveries.\u201d",
      "Musk has promised a cheaper EV model would be coming this year that would boost sales.",
      "It's not clear yet if Musk's latest feud with Trump will help lure back buyers who have been angry at the billionaire's political positions. After Musk once again took to social media to criticize Trump's budget bill, the president threatened Tuesday to use the power of his office to hurt his companies, including Tesla, pushing its stock down more than 5%.",
      "A June AP-NORC poll showed about half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans.",
      "The new figures come as Tesla is focusing less on new models and more on robots, self-driving technology and robotaxis ferrying passengers around without anyone behind the wheel.",
      "Tesla is in the midst of a test run of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, that seems to have gone smoothly for the most part. But it also has drawn the scrutiny of federal car safety regulators because of a few mishaps, including one case in which a Tesla cab was shown on a video heading down an opposing lane.",
      "The competition from rival EV makers is especially fierce in Europe where China's BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. Tesla sales fell 28% in May in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla's best selling Model Y. That new version has been out for months now.",
      "Tesla reports second quarter financial results on July 23. In the first quarter, net income fell 71%.",

      "U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei\u2019s request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there.",
      "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks.",
      "In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.",
      "Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.",
      "Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of \u201ceconomic bullying\u201d and of improperly using national security as a pretext for \u201coppressing Chinese companies.\u201d In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were \u201dimpermissibly extraterritorial,\" and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud.",
      "The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies.",
      "The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.",

      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",

      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",

      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",

      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",

      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",

      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",

      "The 33\u2014page opinion from U.S. District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027.",
      "Apple has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the Justice Department had distorted the contours of the smartphone market and made a series of other misinterpretations that warranted the case be thrown out.",
      "But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial.",
      "The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation.",
      "The lawsuit \u201csets forth several allegations of technological barricades that constitute anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Neals wrote in his opinion. The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \u201cdangerous possibility\u201d that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly.",
      "In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court.\u201d",
      "The antitrust lawsuit isn't the only legal headache threatening to undercut its profits, which totaled $94 billion on sales of $295 billion in its fiscal year ending last September.",

      "Apple also could lose a more than $20 billion annual payment that it gets for making Google the default search tool on the iPhone and other products as part of another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department. A federal judge in Washington D.C. is considering whether to ban the deals with Apple as part of a shake-up being proposed to address Google's illegal monopoly in searc h.",
      "Neals' decision to allow the Justice Department's antitrust case to proceed came on the same day that Apple was hit with a lawsuit by app maker Proton amplifying the accusations of wrongful conduct by the company. The lawsuit, which will seek to be certified as a class action presenting thousands of developers who have made iPhone apps, is asking for punitive damages against Apple, as well as a court order to dismantle its walled garden.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "Humanoid robots have captivated fans in Beijing with a fully autonomous soccer match powered by artificial intelligence",
      "BEIJING -- While China's men's soccer team hasn't generated much excitement in recent years, humanoid robot teams have won over fans in Beijing based more on the AI technology involved than any athletic prowess shown.",
      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.\u201d",
      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",
      "In the final match, Tsinghua University\u2019s THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University\u2019s Mountain Sea team with a score of 5\u20133 to win the championship.",
      "Mr. Wu, a supporter of Tsinghua, celebrated their victory while also praising the competition.",
      "\u201cThey (THU) did really well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Mountain Sea team (of Agricultural University) was also impressive. They brought a lot of surprises.\u201d",
      "China's men have made only one World Cup appearance and have already been knocked out of next years' competition in Canada, Mexico and the United States.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr. said he wants to encourage all Americans to use wearables to track health metrics. What are the benefits and drawbacks?",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy said his vision is for every American to have a wearable within 4 years.",
      "Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the agency was launching a campaign to encourage all Americans to use wearables to track health metrics.",
      "Wearables come in the form of watches, bands, rings, patches and clothes that can be used for a variety of reasons including monitoring glucose levels, measuring activity levels, track heart health and observe sleeping patterns.",
      "\"It's a way \u2026 people can take control over their own heath. They can take responsibility,\" Kennedy said during a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Health. \"They can see, as you know, what food is doing to their glucose levels, their heart rates and a number of other metrics as they eat it. and they can begin to make good judgments about their diet, about their physical activity, about the way that they live their lives.\"",
      "He went on, \"We think that wearables are a key to the MAHA agenda -- Making America Healthy Again. My vision is that every American is wearing a wearable within four years.\"",
      "Digital medicine experts told ABC News that wearables do have benefits and can be used to motivate someone to increase physical activity, which could reduce the risk of poor health outcomes.",
      "However, they said not everybody needs to have a wearable and there are some potential risks including data breaches.",
      "Nabil Alshurafa, an associate professor in the department of preventive medicine and the department of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern University in Illinois, said wearables were born out of the quantified self movement.",
      "This is a movement that endorses using technology to track and analyze personal data for learning and improvement.",
      "\"Just the way when we're driving a vehicle, we see whether we're low on gas, and then we pass by the gas station and repump,\" Alshurafa told ABC News. \"So, the idea was sort of can I see when I'm active? Not active? Can I see when I have poor health habits and then adjust accordingly. Did I have good quality asleep last night? If not, let me try to improve that.\"",
      "He said there are benefits to wearables, mostly in the form of motivation to change behaviors.",
      "A July 2022 study found wearables can empower patients and help with diagnosing conditions, changing behaviors and self-monitoring.",
      "Additionally, a July 2019 study from the University of Florida in Gainesville found wearable devices can motivate and accelerate physical activity, although it did not find consistent improvement in health outcomes.",
      "Dr. David McManus, chair and professor of medicine at UMass Chan Medical School and a digital medicine expert, said an example would be if someone wants to walk 10,000 steps a day and they wear an activity monitor that tells them they only walked 5,000 steps on a particular day. This might motivate that person to walk further to achieve their goal.",
      "In turn, evidence shows people who are more physically active have fewer rates of heart attacks and are less likely to develop high blood pressure or obesity.",
      "\"The benefit would be if a person actually used that information to change their behavior,\" he told ABC News. \"That would be the clearest use case of a person using a wearable to learn. \u2026 I won't say there's convincing concrete evidence that a wearable will prevent heart attacks -- I would be uncomfortable saying that -- but I do think it's reasonable on the basis of preliminary studies and observational studies, there is some potential benefit for certain types of people from wearing devices to get people motivated to change.\"",
      "Alshurafa said clinicians can also receive more granular data about behaviors such as how much energy patients are expending and how many calories they are burning.",
      "It's unclear if Kennedy's connections have played a role in his endorsements of wearables. U.S. surgeon general nominee Casey Means co-founded Levels, an app that allows people to track their food, along with biometric data like sleep and glucose monitoring, to see how their diet is impacting their health.",
      "Additionally, her brother, Calley Means -- an adviser to Kennedy -- has a company that could benefit from more wearables in the world. His company, TruMed, allows people to use funds from Health Savings Accounts towards health products, such as fitness tracker watches.",
      "There are also drawbacks. McManus said there is not a high level of evidence that shows wearables have benefits over the long term.",
      "\"One thing I've learned as a physician and researcher is it's really hard to get people to change their habits,\" he said. \"So it's not so much that the sensors don't work, and it's not so much that they're inaccurate -- because there is plenty of data that shows that wearable devices can present really good, high-quality data -- but the missing link in the chain of wearables to good health is getting people to actually get off their couch and go be more active when they have a wearable them that they've been on the couch.\"",
      "There are also privacy concerns because of the substantial amounts of data that wearables generate, as well as the potential for misuse.",
      "McManus said if a database gets hacked, the data could be compromised and potentially used by a bad actor to steal additional personal information.",
      "\"The more data that's generated, the greater the risk,\" he said.",
      "Authors of a JAMA Viewpoint article in 2019 said another risk is that data could be used against policyholders with higher premiums or to deny insurance.",
      "Because wearables collect health information such as weight, calorie intake and blood pressure, insurance companies could use the data to increase costs, the authors said.",
      "Alshurafa said not everyone needs to wear a wearable and it depends on the patient's condition and what they hope to achieve.",
      "\"We feel once their health improves, we then wean them off it,\" he said. \"So, this notion that someone has to wear a wearable constantly -- well, I mean once the problem is solved, then hopefully there's no need for it.\"",

      "\"The law couldn't be clearer,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said.",
      "More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing an amicus brief on Thursday opposing the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "\u201cThe law couldn't be clearer: the president does not have the authority to unilaterally abolish the Department of Education,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote in a statement first obtained by ABC News, adding, \u201cDonald Trump is not a king, and he cannot single-handedly cut off access to education for students across this country.\u201d",
      "Warren and Reps. Jamie Raskin, Bobby Scott and Rosa DeLauro -- the ranking members of the House\u2019s Education and Judiciary committees -- are leading the 15-page legal document. They\u2019re joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, more than 20 Senate Democrats, and more than 150 other members of the House Democratic caucus.",
      "The lawmakers\u2019 brief attempting to block the administration from abolishing the Department of Education is in support of the NAACP's suit against the government this past spring. In March, that case argued that downsizing the department through a workforce reduction that slashed nearly half the agency\u2019s staff -- among other measures like terminating statutory grant programs -- violates the separation of powers and lacks constitutional authority.",
      "The NAACP, the National Education Association (NEA), and a coalition of groups filed a preliminary injunction with the U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland this week, arguing the judge\u2019s consideration of this case is needed after the administration\u2019s recent decision to pause more than $6 billion in congressionally appropriated education programs ahead of the school year.",
      "\u201cThe motion seeks a remedy for the serious harm that the Trump Administration has inflicted on students, educators, schools, and colleges and universities, and asks the Court to direct the Department to fulfill its statutory obligations to students nationwide,\u201d according to a statement released by the NEA, which represents more than 3 million educators.",
      "Raskin condemned the administration\u2019s efforts to curb public education, contending President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon can\u2019t abolish the agency without congressional approval.",
      "\u201cCongress created the Department of Education to ensure that every student in America could obtain a high-quality, free public school education,\u201d Raskin wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is the right of every citizen and an essential democratic safeguard against political tyranny,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo president has the authority to dismantle a federal agency created by law. We're going to court to defend not only congressional power but the department\u2019s national educational mission, itself a pillar of American democracy,\u201d Raskin added.",
      "The power to reorganize the executive branch belongs to Congress and is underscored by the fact that when presidents have reorganized the executive branch, they have done so \u201cthrough legislation and subject to appropriate restraints,\u201d according to the brief by the lawmakers.",
      "Their brief argues that only Congress has the authority to create, restructure, and abolish federal agencies, it has to be done through legislation, and the Department of Education can\u2019t be unilaterally abolished because it\u2019s statutorily mandated.",
      "Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colorado, told ABC News closing the department would strip \u201cvital support\u201d from tens of millions of students and teachers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with my colleagues in the House and Senate to uphold Congress\u2019 responsibility to ensure every student has access to a quality education and to defend the essential work of the Department of Education,\u201d Neguse said.",
      "Efforts to dismantle the department have been blocked by lower courts this spring. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a Massachusetts case that could decide whether the firing of nearly 2,000 employees at the agency stands. McMahon has stressed the critical functions of the department remain and that services like students with disabilities, for example, could ultimately be moved to other agencies.",
      "The brief is part of Warren\u2019s larger Save Our Schools campaign that she started after Trump signed an executive order to diminish the Department of Education.",
      "\"The federal government has invested in our public schools,\" Warren told ABC News in April. \"Taking that away from our kids so that a handful of billionaires can be even richer is just plain ugly, and I will fight it with everything I've got.\"",
      "The senator has previously requested the agency's Office of Inspector General review the Department of Government Efficiency's alleged \"infiltration\" of the agency's internal federal student loan database. Prior to the Save Our Schools campaign, she investigated the firing of federal student aid employees and how a reduction in staff at the agency could have \"dire consequences\" for borrowers.",
      "The brief also comes after Raskin and several other House Democrats met with McMahon about the future of the agency. That meeting appeared to leave many with unanswered questions, like Rep. Frederica Wilson, a senior member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, who also signed on to the amicus brief.",
      "\"For the Department of Education to be dismantled, it is going to bring a shock to this nation,\" said Wilson, a former principal and lifelong educator. \"Schools are the bedrock of this nation. When schools are working, our country is, too.\"",

      "The disclosure of the DIA findings, first reported by CNN, enraged Trump who said the pilots were \"devastated.\"",

      "President Donald Trump will be in Iowa to kick off a year of patriotic festivities leading up to next year's 250th anniversary of American independence",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to deliver a \u201cspectacular\u201d yearlong birthday party to mark 250 years of American independence. On Thursday, he will be in the U.S. heartland to kick off the patriotic festivities leading up to next year\u2019s anniversary.",
      "The event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines will feature \u201cdazzling\u201d displays of Americana and American history, musical performances and a fireworks show to cap the night, said U.S. Ambassador Monica Crowley, Trump\u2019s liaison to the organizing group, America250.",
      "Organizers see the coming year of festivities as a way to help unite a polarized nation and bridge partisanship \u2014 a monumental task given the country's divides. Thursday's event comes as the Republican-controlled Congress pushed for final passage of a sweeping tax cuts and spending package that's at the heart of Trump's legislative agenda but has united all Democrats against it. More U.S. adults also disapprove than approve of how the Republican president is doing his job.",
      "Iowa was a \u201clogical choice\u201d for the kickoff, Crowley said, because of its central location and Trump's affinity for the state, which supported him in each of the last three general elections. She also said Iowa's middle-of-the-country geography is symbolic of the desire to use the coming celebrations to help bring people together.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had so much division and so much polarization over the last many decades, but certainly over the last few years, that to be able to bring the country together to celebrate America\u2019s 250th birthday through patriotism, shared values and a renewed sense of civic pride, to be able to do that in the center of the country, is incredibly important,\u201d she said.",
      "A recent Gallup poll showed the widest partisan split in patriotism in over two decades, with only about a third of Democrats saying they are proud to be American compared with about 9 in 10 Republicans.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump's performance as president, according to a June AP-NORC poll, while about 6 in 10 disapprove. That poll also showed a majority of Americans said the June military parade that Trump greenlit in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army \u2014 an event that fell on his 79th birthday \u2014 was \u201cnot a good use\u201d of government money.",
      "Crowley spoke to the political and ideological schisms that left the country \u201ctorn apart\u201d ahead of its last big birthday celebration, noting that 1976 closely followed the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led Richard Nixon to resign from the presidency.",
      "\u201cThat moment was critical to uniting the country and moving forward, and I am very optimistic and hopeful that the yearlong celebration that we\u2019re about to launch will do the same thing in this present moment,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "America's 250th birthday \u201cis something that I think that all Americans can come together to celebrate and honor our history as well as our present and our future,\u201d Crowley said.",
      "On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, officially marking the 13 colonies' split from Great Britain.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a big, big celebration, as you know, 250 years,\u201d Trump said about the birthday during his Memorial Day address to a solemn audience at Arlington National Cemetery. \u201cIn some ways, I\u2019m glad I missed that second term where it was because I wouldn\u2019t be your president for that.\"",
      "Video of then-candidate Trump proposing a \u201cGreat American State Fair\u201d in Iowa in May 2023 began to recirculate after his reelection last November. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, told the White House earlier this year that Iowa stood \u201cready\" to host the event and that Trump had the state's full support, according to a draft of Reynolds' letter obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The culminating fair instead will be held next year on the National Mall in Washington, according to a White House official who was not authorized to share details publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. But Trump honored his initial proposal with a kickoff in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.",
      "The lineup Thursday night will include Lee Greenwood, according to social media posts advertising the event, whose song, \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d is a regular feature at Trump rallies and official events. Also attending will be Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.",

      "About $4.7 billion was provided in 2023 alone in grants to support health departments, hospitals, universities and nonprofits across the country, the group said.",
      "As a result of cuts to CDC funding for local health departments, \"Americans will be sicker and more will be losing their lives unnecessarily,\" Dr. Tom Farley, a former health commissioner of Philadelphia and New York City, predicted.",
      "One of the largest cuts would be to chronic disease prevention, the former officials noted, including tobacco prevention, HIV prevention and injury prevention, which includes drownings -- a leading cause of death in young kids.",

      "The assessment from Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, appeared to be significantly more optimistic than by U.N. inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency. IAEA's director general Rafael Grossi said last weekend that he believed Iran could begin enriching uranium in a matter of months.",

      "\"It's delayed by one to two years. I think we're thinking probably closer to two years,\" Parnell told reporters.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration is pausing over $6 billion of congressionally-appropriated federal funding for after-school, student support, teacher training, English language and other education programs, according to a Department of Education memo obtained by ABC News.",
      "In a letter to Congress from the agency's office of legislation and congressional affairs Monday afternoon, the DOE said a notification would be sent to certain grantees alerting them that funding for the upcoming school year would be reviewed on July 1 and decisions concerning this academic year have \"not yet been made.\"",
      "\"The department will not be issuing grant award notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review,\" the memo reads in part. \"The department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president's priorities and the department's statutory responsibilities.\"",

      "The 2024 National Teacher of the Year Missy Testerman, an English as a Second Language (ESL) instructor in Tennessee, told ABC News any withholding of funds will affect schools.",
      "\"School budgets are already very tight, so withholding funds for required programs -- such as those for English learners -- will certainly place a burden on school systems,\" Testerman wrote in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"This likely will mean that systems will face the difficult decision to make budget cuts in other areas, affecting students. In rural systems like mine, this could mean a reduction in overall staff or the elimination of crucial supports for students such as afterschool and tutoring programs,\" Testerman added.",
      "House Education and Workforce Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., called the move to withhold the appropriated funds a violation of federal law with potentially devastating consequences.",

      "\"Cash-strapped school districts, particularly those in low-income and rural areas, cannot afford this delay and will likely be forced to either lay off staff or cut back on programs and services while the White House Office of Budget and Management 'reviews' the funding,\" Scott said.",
      "State attorneys general are expected to sue the administration over the reviews, according to a source familiar with the matter. Parents groups and education advocates decrying the decision are also mounting lawsuits against the administration, the source confirmed. Advocates accuse the administration of undermining public education in a \"cruel betrayal\" of students.",
      "\"Schools are already grappling with severe teacher shortages, burnout and under-resourced classrooms, and here comes the federal government ripping resources away from public schools. It is outrageous and unconscionable,\" said National Education Association President Becky Pringle.",

      "The pause comes as efforts to dismantle the Department of Education have been blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court is also expected to weigh in on the firing of nearly 2,000 employees at the agency.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the members of his newly appointed vaccine panel are casting doubt on the hepatitis B vaccine and the established practice of vaccinating newborns.",
      "Last week, during the first meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since Kennedy removed all the previous sitting members and appointed seven new members, the chair questioned whether it was \"wise\" to administer shots \"to every newborn before leaving the hospital.\"",
      "Martin Kulldorff, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said a new work group would discuss the practice.",
      "Additionally, Kennedy claimed, without evidence, earlier this week during an interview with Tucker Carlson, that the CDC conducted a study that found the hepatitis B vaccine increases the risk of autism, and that researchers hid the results of the study from the public.",
      "The HHS did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for the study that Kennedy referenced in his interview.",
      "An infectious disease expert told ABC News that there is no evidence to suggest the hepatitis B vaccine is unsafe and that vaccinating babies at birth has been key to virtually eliminating the virus among children.",
      "What is hepatitis B?",
      "Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus, according to the CDC. The virus is transmitted from a person coming into contact with the blood, semen or other bodily fluid of someone who is infected.",
      "Newborns might be infected through the process of birth or from casual contact, because the virus can survive in the environment for about a week, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told ABC News.",
      "Up to half of all older children, adolescents and adults have symptoms of acute hepatitis B. Most children younger than age 5, however, have no symptoms, the CDC said.",
      "\"Hepatitis B \u2026 causes inflammation in the liver \u2026and that inflammation leads to the liver not working well at all,\" Chin-Hong said. \"So that's cirrhosis and liver failure and, ultimately, also liver cancer. The longer you have hepatitis B, the higher the risk of cirrhosis or liver failure and liver cancer.\"",
      "Acute hepatitis B infection, which is a short-term illness, can lead to a lifelong infection known as chronic hepatitis B, according to the CDC",
      "Chin-Hong said that means if somebody is born with hepatitis B or infected as a child, they have a high chance of liver failure or liver cancer as an adult.",
      "Benefits of vaccination",
      "Chin-Hong said the best way for someone to prevent hepatitis B and to protect themselves is by getting vaccinated.",
      "The vaccine was first developed in the early 1980s. Depending on the vaccine brand, the hepatitis B vaccine is either a series of two or three shots, according to the CDC.",
      "The childhood immunization schedule recommends babies be vaccinated at birth with a second dose between one and two months old and a potential third dose from 6 months to 15 months old.",
      "\"The more shots you get, the higher the chance the vaccine will take,\" Chin-Hong said. \"If you get three shots, it's above 97% efficacy.\"",
      "In 1991, when the ACIP recommended universal vaccination for hepatitis B among infants to decrease transmission, there were 18,000 cases of hepatitis B in those under 10 years old in the U.S., according to the CDC.",
      "Since then, cases have dramatically decreased. CDC data shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.",
      "\"It's very, very rare,\" Chin-Hong said. \"So, we've had a big success, and the United States is a mirror for the rest of the world \u2026 97% of countries now have a recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination in infants. It's really changed the face of not only infection and liver failure, but also liver cancer.\"",
      "Why hepatitis B vaccination is safe",
      "During the ACIP meeting last week, Kulldorff implied that children receive too many vaccines nowadays compared to decades ago.",
      "\"The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceeds what children in most other developed nations receive and what most of us in this room received when we were children,\" Kulldorff said.",
      "Chin-Hong said that by adding vaccines to the immunization schedule, children have more protection against diseases compared to 10 or even 20 years ago, and the makeup of vaccines is also different.",
      "\"The way that we're delivering the vaccines is very different,\" he said. \"They're through smaller bits of the virus instead of the whole virus itself or bacteria. So, it means that infants are exposed to actually fewer antigens. or parts of the virus or bacteria, with better vaccines.\"",
      "The ACIP announcing that well-studied vaccines, like the hepatitis B vaccine, are going to be reanalyzed could make people think the initial approval process was unsafe, according to Chin-Hong.",
      "As for Kennedy's claim, the HHS secretary has been a long-time vaccine skeptic who refused to say during his confirmation hearings earlier this year that vaccines don't cause autism despite many high-quality studies finding no such link.",
      "\"There's no evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine leads to autism or is a risk factor for autism, and that is unquestionable,\" Chin-Hong said.",

      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

      "The single engine Cessna 208B radioed about having engine trouble after takeoff and crashed on landing Wednesday evening near Cross Keys Airport, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) southeast of Philadelphia, authorities said. A initial report posted Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration said the aircraft, with 14 passengers and one crew member, \u201ccrashed while returning to the airport after a runway excursion into trees.\u201d",

      "Clouds start to build in the early afternoon and the air becomes sweet with the promise of rain",
      "ESPA\u00d1OLA, N.M. -- Clouds build up in the early afternoon and gusty winds push in every direction. The skies darken and then comes the rain \u2014 often a downpour that is gone as quickly as it came.",
      "This seasonal dance choreographed by Mother Nature marks a special time for the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is when residents clasp their hands, hoping for much-needed moisture to dampen the threat of wildfire and keep rivers flowing.",
      "Forecasters say it has been a wet start to this year\u2019s monsoon season, which officially began June 15 and runs through the end of September. Parts of New Mexico and West Texas have been doused with rain, while Arizona and Nevada have been hit with dust storms, which are a common hazard of the season.",
      "In other parts of the world, monsoons often mean months of never-ending rain.",
      "In North America, the season can have considerable variability. The bursts and breaks depend on how much moisture is circulating and which way the wind blows.",
      "The monsoon relies on the buildup of summer heat and shifting wind direction, which helps funnel moisture from distant bodies of water to areas where rain is sparse.",
      "Just ahead of the monsoon, officials with the Navajo Nation declared an emergency because of worsening drought conditions across the reservation, which spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.",
      "Below-average precipitation month after month has left little forage for livestock, and fire danger has ramped up as pockets of moderate and severe drought expand. Ranchers and farmers are being urged to reduce their herds, shift to drought-tolerant crops and limit irrigation.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s governor also declared an emergency in May because of severe drought and escalating fire risk.",
      "Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Integrated Drought Information System say monsoonal rainfall only provides a fraction of the West\u2019s water supplies, with the majority coming from snowpack. Still, summer rains can reduce drought impacts by lessening the demand for water stored in reservoirs, recharging soil moisture and groundwater, and reducing the risk of wildfires.",
      "New Mexico and Arizona typically stand to benefit the most from the North American monsoon, getting anywhere between 10% to 60% of their annual precipitation during the season. It has a lesser influence in Nevada and California, though southern Nevada on average gets 20% to 25% of its precipitation during the summer.",
      "Along the Rio Grande at the base of the Jemez Mountains, Santa Ana Pueblo farmers are eagerly watching the afternoon skies. Pueblo Gov. Myron Armijo said they have already had several good downpours, and he wouldn\u2019t mind more.",
      "But that will be for the spirits to decide, Armijo said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not up to us,\u201d he said.",
      "With summer rains come increased river flows and in some cases flooding in normally dry washes and across the scars left by wildfires.",
      "Sandbag stations have been set up in communities across the region \u2014 from Tucson, Arizona, to Albuquerque and San Antonio, Texas. In Espa\u00f1ola, state transportation workers have closed a historic bridge that funnels traffic across the Rio Grande, citing concerns about higher flows further eroding a concrete pier.",
      "On the edge of the Gila National Forest, New Mexico National Guard troops have delivered dozens of pallets of filled sandbags for residents who are preparing for flooding following a blaze that has charred about 74 square miles (192 square kilometers).",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of firefighters are hoping for higher humidity and rain to tamp down a wildfire that is racing through a mountainous area of the Navajo Nation. Fire officials reported that the flames made a 6-mile (9.66-kilometer) run in a matter of hours.",
      "Once the fire is out, land managers acknowledge that the monsoon will be a mixed blessing, as rainfall on the charred hillsides will surely result in surges of runoff filled with ash and debris.",
      "Just as light and shadow move across the mesa tops beyond artist Daniel McCoy\u2019s studio, the Rio Grande pulses with each downpour, turning into what looks like a sudsy caramel concoction as it carries away sediment.",
      "The river and the desert badlands and purple mountain peaks that border it are the inspiration for the giant canvasses McCoy is preparing for an upcoming show at the Hecho a Mano gallery in Santa Fe.",
      "McCoy, who is Muskogee (Creek) and Potawatomi, grew up working on a farm with his grandfather in Oklahoma. He and his green thumb faced new challenges when he moved to the arid Southwest, where water shortages often lead to mandatory rationing and pleas for prayers.",
      "A sign down the street from his studio reads in Spanish: \u201cEl Agua No Se Vende. El Agua Se Defiende.\u201d It means water isn\u2019t for sale, and the right to access the finite resource should be defended.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s made me mindful more than I ever thought I would be,\u201d he said of hearing stories from longtime locals about the preciousness of water.",

      "A volunteer searching the archives of the American Baptist in Massachusetts has found a nearly 180-year-old document shedding light on the church's support for ending slavery",
      "GROTON, Mass. -- Jennifer Cromack was combing through the American Baptist archive when she uncovered a slim box among some 18th and 19th century journals. Opening it, she found a scroll in pristine condition.",
      "A closer look revealed the 5-foot-long (1.5-meter-long) document was a handwritten declaration titled \u201cA Resolution and Protest Against Slavery,\" signed by 116 New England ministers in Boston and adopted March 2, 1847. Until its discovery in May at the archives in Groton, Massachusetts, American Baptist officials worried the anti-slavery document had been lost forever after fruitless searches at Harvard and Brown universities and other locations. A copy was last seen in a 1902 history book.",
      "\u201cI was just amazed and excited,\u201d Cromack, a retired teacher who volunteers at the archive, said. \u201cWe made a find that really says something to the people of the state and the people in the country. ... It speaks of their commitment to keeping people safe and out of situations that they should not be in.\"",
      "The document offers a glimpse into an emerging debate over slavery in the 18th century in the Northeast. The document was signed 14 years before the start of the Civil War as a growing number of religious leaders were starting to speak out against slavery.",
      "The document also shines a spotlight on a critical moment in the history of the Baptist church.",
      "It was signed two years after the issue of slavery prompted southern Baptists to split from northern Baptists and form the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. The split in 1845 followed a ruling by the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society prohibiting slave owners from becoming missionaries. The northern Baptists eventually became American Baptist Churches USA.",
      "\u201cIt comes from such a critical era in American history, you know, right prior to the Civil War,\u201d said Rev. Mary Day Hamel, the executive minister of the American Baptist Churches of Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cIt was a unique moment in history when Baptists in Massachusetts stepped up and took a strong position and stood for justice in the shaping of this country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s become part of our heritage to this day, to be people who stand for justice, for American Baptists to embrace diversity.\u201d",
      "Deborah Bingham Van Broekhoven, the executive director emerita of the American Baptist Historical Society, said many Americans at the time, especially in the North, were \u201cundecided\u201d about slavery and weren't sure how to respond or were worried about speaking out.",
      "\u201cThey thought it was a southern problem, and they had no business getting involved in what they saw as the state\u2019s rights,\u201d Van Broekhoven said. \u201cMost Baptists, prior to this, would have refrained from this kind of protest. This is a very good example of them going out on a limb and trying to be diplomatic.\u201d",
      "The document shows ministers had hoped \u201csome reformatory movement\u201d led by those involved in slavery would make their action \u201cunnecessary,\u201d but that they felt compelled to act after they \u201cwitnessed with painful surprise, a growing disposition to justify, extend and perpetuate their iniquitous system.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder these circumstances we can no longer be silent,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe owe something to the oppressed as well as to the oppressor, and justice demands the fulfillment of that obligation. Truth and Humanity and Public Virtue, have claims upon us which we cannot dishonor.\u201d",
      "The document explains why the ministers \u201cdisapprove and abhor the system of American slavery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith such a system we can have no sympathy,\u201d the document states. \u201cAfter a careful observation of its character and effects and making every deduction with the largest charity can require, we are constrained to regard it as an outrage upon the rights and happiness of our fellow men, for which there is no valid justification or apology.\u201d",
      "Rev. Diane Badger, the administrator of the American Baptist Church of Massachusetts who oversees the archive, teamed up with Rev. John Odams of the First Baptist Church in Boston to identify what she called the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of abolitionist-era Baptist documents. Her great-grandfather was an American Baptist minister.",
      "Since its discovery, Badger has put all the ministers' names on a spreadsheet along with the names of the churches where they served. Among them was Nathaniel Colver, of Tremont Temple in Boston, one of the first integrated churches in the country, now known as Tremont Temple Baptist Church. Another was Baron Stow, who belonged to the state's anti-slavery society.",
      "Badger also is working to estimate the value of the document, which is intact with no stains or damage, and is making plans to ensure it is protected. A digital copy could eventually be shared with some of Massachusetts' 230 American Baptist churches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of an interesting journey and it\u2019s one that\u2019s still unfolding,\u201d Badger said. \u201cThe questions that always come to me, OK, I know who signed it but who didn\u2019t? I can go through my list, through my database and find who was working where on that and why didn\u2019t they sign that. So it\u2019s been very interesting to do the research.\u201d",
      "Rev. Kenneth Young \u2014 whose predominantly Black Calvary Baptist Church in Haverhill, Massachusetts, was created by freed Blacks in 1871 \u2014 called the discovery inspiring.",
      "\u201cI thought it was awesome that we had over hundred signers to this, that they would project that freedom for our people is just,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt follows through on the line of the abolitionist movement and fighting for those who may not have had the strength to fight for themselves against a system of racism.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",

      "The man accused of killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due back in court after a week's delay",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- The man charged with killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due back in federal court Thursday for a hearing that was put on hold after his lawyer said his client had been unable to sleep while on suicide watch.",
      "The hearing is expected to address whether Vance Boelter should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed with the case. He's not expected to enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first, before his arraignment, which is when a plea is normally entered.",
      "An unshaven Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, was wearing a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers when he was brought into court last Friday. Federal defender Manny Atwal then asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing. She said Boelter had been sleep deprived due to harsh conditions in the Sherburne County Jail, making it difficult for them to communicate.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I haven\u2019t really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\u201d Boelter told the judge then. And he denied being suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.\u201d",
      "Sherburne County Sheriff Joel Brott, whose jail houses both county and federal prisoners, rejected Boelter's claims of poor conditions as absurd. \u201cHe is not in a hotel. He\u2019s in jail, where a person belongs when they commit the heinous crimes he is accused of committing,\" Brott said in a statement Friday.",
      "Boelter faces separate cases in federal and state court on charges of murder and attempted murder for what the state's chief federal prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination\u201d and \u201ca chilling attack on our democracy.\u201d The feds are going first.",
      "Authorities say Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot to death in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park in the early hours of June 14 by a man disguised as a police officer who was driving a fake squad car.",
      "Boelter also allegedly shot and seriously wounded state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, earlier that morning at their home in nearby Champlin. The Hoffmans are recovering, but Hortman's golden retriever, Gilbert, was seriously injured and had to be euthanized.",
      "Boelter surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history, a hunt of around 40 hours.",
      "Atwal told the court last week that Boelter had been kept in what\u2019s known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his first court appearance June 16. She said the lights were on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slammed frequently, the inmate in the next cell would spread feces on the walls, and the smell would drift to Boelter\u2019s cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity, and let him communicate better. The judge granted the delay.",
      "Boelter\u2019s lawyers have declined to comment on the charges themselves, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson has said no decision has been made whether to seek it. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. But Attorney General Pam Bondi has said from the start that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in seeking capital punishment.",
      "Prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. They also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",
      "Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the mourners at the Hortmans' funeral last Saturday. Gov. Tim Walz, Harris's running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, eulogized Hortman as \u201cthe most consequential speaker in Minnesota history.\u201d",
      "Hortman served as speaker from 2019 until January. She then yielded the post to a Republican in a power-sharing deal after the House became tied in the 2024 elections, and became speaker emerita.",

      "In the state that served as the model for Obamacare, advocates and health care workers fear the Trump administration is trying to dismantle the program piece-by-piece",
      "BOSTON -- In the state that served as the model for Obamacare, advocates and health care workers fear the Trump administration is trying to dismantle piece-by-piece a popular program that has provided insurance, preventive care and life-saving medication to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "Provisions contained in both the Senate and House versions of the massive tax and spending cuts bill advancing in Congress \u2014 a centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 could strip health insurance from up to a quarter of the roughly 400,000 people enrolled in the Massachusetts Health Connector, according to state estimates.",
      "The changes would create anew the coverage gaps state leaders were working to close when Massachusetts in 2006 became the first U.S. state to enact a law requiring nearly every resident to have health insurance, state officials say. Beyond the effect on residents' health, losing care could have broader repercussions \u2014 both for the program's finances and residents' ability to make a living.",
      "\u201cThe idea of needing to unwind that now and pull back on that promise and commitment is really frustrating and heartbreaking and cruel and counterproductive,\u201d said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of Massachusetts\u2019 health insurance marketplace.",
      "Trump and Republican supporters in Congress say the changes, which include new documentation requirements and limitations on who can apply for tax credits to help pay for insurance, are necessary to root out what they call fraud, waste and abuse. The Affordable Care Act changes proposed in both versions of the bill, along with massive cuts to Medicaid and other programs, would eliminate roughly $1.1 trillion in health care spending over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In Lawrence, a mill community of around 90,000 people on the Merrimack River, where more than 80% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, Kesia Moreta said she's already seeing people slip out of the state's health care network because of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "Moreta, who manages a program created under the ACA that helps people sign up for coverage, said clients have been missing meetings out of fear that being enrolled for health insurance will harm their effort to stay in the U.S. legally.",
      "Recently, a father of a U.S.-born teenage son with epilepsy deleted every email related to his health plan and stopped answering calls from the Connector after watching reports about deportations on social media. When his son\u2019s medication ran out, Moreta said the father finally reached out, whispering over the phone, \u201cIs this going to get me deported?\u201d",
      "\u201cThat breaks our hearts,\u201d Moreta said.",
      "More than 98% of Massachusetts residents have health insurance, the lowest rate of uninsurance in the country, according to the Massachusetts Health Insurance Survey.",
      "Vicky Pulos, an attorney for the Mass Law Reform Institute who helps low-income people gain access to health care, said Republicans who tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act during the first Trump administration have decided to take it apart incrementally despite its growing popularity.",
      "\u201cIt really seems like this is just a less transparent way of effectively dismantling the accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act in both Medicaid and the marketplace,\u201d Pulos said.",
      "The changes, she added, \u201cwill massively drive up the number of uninsured but without openly repealing the ACA.\u201d",
      "Another provision included in both the House and Senate bills would require people applying for or renewing coverage to provide more documentation of their income, household size and immigration status to be eligible for premium tax credits when the state marketplace already has that information, which Morse Gasteier said would cause \u201cfriction, red tape and delays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said the proposals will \u201cput a stop\u201d to immigrants \u201cstealing taxpayer-funded health care benefits meant for American citizens.\u201d",
      "No states use federal money to provide health insurance to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Some, like Massachusetts, use state tax dollars to do so to provide basic primary care services for a small population of vulnerable residents, like children.",
      "No undocumented immigrants receive insurance through the state marketplace.",
      "Of the 400,000 enrolled in the state marketplace, around 60,000 are noncitizens who are in the U.S. legally and would lose access to federal premium tax credits if either chamber's version of the bill becomes law. The number includes domestic violence and human trafficking victims, refugees, people granted asylum or humanitarian parole, temporary protected status and other work-authorized immigrants.",
      "Without the credits, premiums will cost upwards of $500 or $600 \u2014 an increase many people can't afford, Morse Gasteier said. Around half are green-card holders with an annual income of $15,000 a year or less.",
      "The remaining 40,000 people expected to lose coverage are U.S. citizens Morse Gasteier said could be stymied in applying or recertifying coverage by provisions like the increased documentation requirements.",
      "Morse Gasteier said Massachusetts' marketplace worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to enroll vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations after the state program \u2014 formed under the leadership of then-Gov. Mitt Romney and known as \u201cRomneycare\" \u2014 was created.",
      "She worries that if people hear help is no longer available, \u201centire populations will just sort of give up on health insurance.\u201d",
      "In addition to affecting residents' health, that could have an economic impact in the state.",
      "Immigrants with legal status enrolled in the state marketplace tend to be younger than the rest of the population, Morse Gasteier said. Their presence brings premiums down for others because they tend to be healthier.",
      "In Lawrence, advocates who help people obtain insurance coverage though the ACA marketplace say the burden would fall disproportionately on people with chronic health issues like diabetes and chronic heart disease.",
      "The Greater Lawrence Community Action Council assists around 10,000 people a year with either signing up for or renewing health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not healthy, let me tell you, you can\u2019t work. If you can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t pay your bills. It\u2019s just as simple as that,\u201d said GLCAC CEO Vilma Martinez-Dominguez.",
      "Moreta said one man who called her from the emergency room recently said he discovered his health insurance had lapsed. Moreta said she could help him renew it, and urged him to wait at the hospital.",
      "He told her not to do anything. He was leaving the hospital. She has no idea what became of him.",

      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines.

      "Though the person he called his aunt \u2014 born Reba Caroline Bailey \u2014 had been estranged, missing for decades and died in 2015 as an unidentified ward of the state, he felt connection and a sense of closure.",
      "\u201cI want to let Reba know we\u2019re part of the circle and part of the family,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark Bailey was among dozens of attendees at an unusual funeral service with military honors this week for an Illinois veteran with memory problems so severe that they died an unnamed person. The ceremony became possible because of an extraordinary cold case investigation that identified the 75-year-old postmortem.",
      "Investigators unearthed the mystery of how the Women\u2019s Army Corps veteran ended up homeless in Chicago with few recollections of their own life, aside from identifying as a man named Seven.",
      "\u201cI never knew I had this family member,\u201d said Mark Bailey\u2019s 19-year-old son Cole, who also drove from central Illinois for the service. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I have somebody that\u2019s been found and isn\u2019t lost anymore.\u201d",
      "Since the investigation\u2019s conclusion, the numbered cement cylinder that marked the unidentified grave has been replaced with a rectangular plague with a cross that reads: \u201cReba Caroline Bailey, PFC US Army.\u201d",
      "The case of Seven Doe, the name appearing in some official records, came to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart\u2019s office in 2023. The unidentified body belonged to a person who died of natural causes in an assisted living facility. They were a ward of the state, unable to remember a legal name or family.",
      "The cause of death was heart disease with diabetes and dementia as contributing factors and the body was buried in a section for unclaimed people at Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery on Chicago's Far South Side. The medical examiner marked it as the 4,985th case of the year and put the number on the headstone.",
      "In 2023, investigators ran fingerprints taken postmortem and found a 1961 Army record for the veteran, formerly of Danville, about 140 miles (225.31 kilometers) south of Chicago. The search for close living relatives came up short; five siblings and an ex-husband had all died.",
      "The family members they did locate had only heard stories of a relative who had disappeared. After making the identification, detectives ordered a new headstone with the same name on military records. It was quietly installed last year.",
      "Commander Jason Moran, who oversees the sheriff\u2019s missing persons unit, said it was rewarding to make sure the identified veteran got the benefit of a funeral with military honors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a privilege to be able to help families and really close the story,\u201d said Moran, whose work on other high-profile cold cases has gained notoriety.",
      "Several generations of the Bailey family have told stories about what happened to their missing relative since leaving the military to get married.",
      "They've wondered about the possibility of children or their relative's gender identity. Some believe that there was a family dispute but the stories about its origins vary from the decision to join the military to sexual orientation.",
      "Family members tried to find their missing relative over the years, including Amanda Ingram, who would have been a great-niece. She maintains a meticulous family tree with Census records and photos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how somebody can just disappear like that and not know what happened,\u201d Ingram said this week. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re never going to know the details.\u201d",
      "On a winter day in the late 1970s, a person wearing a military-style jacket and aviator cap was curled up on the porch of St. Francis Catholic Worker House in Chicago.

      "The first group of immigrants are set to arrive at a new detention center deep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "OCHOPEE, Fla. -- The first group of immigrants were scheduled to arrive Wednesday night at a new detention center deep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the state's attorney general said.",
      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,\" Florida Republican Attorney General James Uthmeier said on the X social media platform. \"Next stop: back to where they came from.\u201d",
      "The facility, at an airport used for training, will have a capacity of about 3,000 detainees when fully operational, according to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The center was built in eight days over 10 miles (16 kilometers) of Everglades. It features more than 200 security cameras, 28,000-plus feet (8,500 meters) of barbed wire and 400 security personnel.",
      "Environmental groups and Native American tribes have protested against the center, contending it is a threat to the fragile Everglades system, would be cruel to detainees because of heat and mosquitoes, and is on land the tribes consider sacred.",
      "DeSantis and other state officials say locating the facility in the rugged and remote Florida Everglades is meant as a deterrent, and naming it after the notorious federal prison of Alcatraz, an island fortress known for its brutal conditions, is meant to send a message. It\u2019s another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying on scare tactics to try to persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.",
      "State and federal officials have touted the plans on social media and conservative airwaves, sharing a meme of a compound ringed with barbed wire and \u201cguarded\u201d by alligators wearing hats labeled \u201cICE\u201d for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Republican Party of Florida has taken to fundraising off the detention center, selling branded T-shirts and beer koozies emblazoned with the facility\u2019s name.",

      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants earmarked for immigrants\u2019 children and low-income students to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "Senior U.N. officials warn that Haiti\u2019s gangs have gained \u201cnear-total control\u201d of the capital and authorities are unable to stop escalating violence across the impoverished Caribbean nation",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Haiti\u2019s gangs have gained \u201cnear-total control\u201d of the capital and authorities are unable to stop escalating violence across the impoverished Caribbean nation, senior U.N. officials warned Wednesday.",
      "An estimated 90% of the capital Port-au-Prince is now under control of criminal groups who are expanding attacks not only into surrounding areas but beyond into previously peaceful areas, Ghada Fathy Waly, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\u201cSouthern Haiti, which until recently was insulated from the violence, has seen a sharp increase in gang-related incidents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the east, criminal groups are exploiting land routes, including key crossings like Belladere and Malpasse, where attacks against police and customs officials have been reported.\u201d",
      "Waly said the state\u2019s authority to govern is rapidly shrinking as gang control expands with cascading effects. Criminal groups are stepping into the vacuum left by the absence or limited delivery of public services and are establishing \u201cparallel governance structures,\u201d and gang control of major trade routes has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for cooking fuel and rice, Haiti\u2019s staple food, she said.",
      "U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca told the council \u201cthe ongoing gang encirclement of Port-au-Prince\u201d and their strengthened foothold in the capital and beyond is \u201cpushing the situation closer to the brink.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout increased action by the international community, the total collapse of state presence in the capital could become a very real scenario,\u201d he warned.",
      "Gangs have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July 2021 and previously were estimated to control 85% of the capital. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination.",
      "A  U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 proposal in February to have the U.N. provide drones, fuel, ground and air transport and other non-lethal support to the Kenya-led mission has languished in the council.",
      "In response to the gangs, the UNODC\u2019s Waly said there has been a rapid growth in the number and activities of private security companies and vigilante self-defense groups, with some trying to protect their communities while others act illegally and collude with gangs.",
      "\u201cOver the last three months,\" Jenca said, \"these groups reportedly killed at least 100 men and one woman suspected of gang association or collaboration.\u201d",
      "He said the last three months have also seen an increase in sexual violence by gangs with the U.N. political mission in Haiti documenting 364 incidents of sexual violence involving 378 survivors just from March to April.",
      "A new report by U.N. experts covering the period from last October through February said the gangs have exploited political turmoil and the disorganized response to Haiti\u2019s security crisis, pointing to competing political ambitions and allegations of corruption within Haiti\u2019s transitional governing bodies that have stymied action.",
      "\u201cWhile the expansion of territorial control brings gangs additional sources of revenue and bargaining power,\u201d the experts said, \u201cthese attacks are also backed by individuals trying to destabilize the political transition for their own political goals.\u201d",
      "One major result is that very little progress has been made toward restoring public security or implementing the roadmap for organizing national elections by February 2026, the experts monitoring an arms embargo on Haiti and sanctions against key gang leaders said in the report to the Security Council.",
      "With a weak national police force facing acute tensions in its leadership, an army that needs rebuilding, and the limited ability of the multinational force, the experts warned that the gangs will continue \u201cto have the upper hand unless stronger international support is provided.\u201d",
      "As for vigilante groups, the experts said, they \u201coften include local police officers, some of whom actively participate in human rights violations.\u201d",
      "The Haitian National Police have also carried out \u201ca worrying number of extrajudicial killings \u2026 with suspected gang members often summarily executed,\u201d the experts said, pointing to 281 summary executions by specialized police units in 2024 including 22 women and 8 children.",
      "Despite the U.N. arms embargo on Haiti, gangs continue to obtain more powerful weapons not only from regional civilian markets but from police stockpiles in Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic, the experts said.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has vetoed a bill that would repeal an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate for power generation",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein vetoed legislation Wednesday that in part would repeal an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set for power generation in a 2021 law, arguing that the bill would have discouraged diverse energy sources and harmed consumers.",
      "The measure, which largely addresses activities involving Duke Energy \u2014 the state's dominant electric utility \u2014 would get rid of the current requirement that electric regulators take \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030.",
      "A directive in the 2021 law to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 stays in place with or without the legislation.",
      "Environmental critics who want cleaner energy sources to come online sooner urged Stein to veto the bill. They also were unhappy with other bill provisions that they argue will make Duke Energy more profitable and shift costs of producing or purchasing electricity to residential customers.",
      "The bill \u201cwalks back our state\u2019s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,\u201d Stein said in a news release. \u201cMy job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy. This bill fails that test.\u201d",
      "Stein, a former attorney general who took office in January, also vetoed two more bills Wednesday from dozens still on his desk left by the GOP-controlled legislature.",
      "These and four other recent Stein vetoes are subject to potential override votes, perhaps coming as soon as later this month. Speaking Wednesday only on the energy bill, House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger expressed confidence in successful overrides. Over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voted for the measure in June.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law was the result of a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "Now GOP supporters of the current bill say the 70% reduction mandate is unnecessary and will needlessly raise customer rates by requiring outsize growth for renewable sources like solar and wind power. The state Utilities Commission already pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years.",
      "By focusing on meeting the 2050 carbon-neutrality mandate, bill supporters say, regulators can direct Duke Energy, which backed the measure, to assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases.",
      "They cite an analysis performed by a state agency that represents utility customers that calculated the repeal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend on energy sources for the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents, which include several environmental groups, question the savings figure. And Stein cited another study in saying the bill could cost utility customers more through 2050 due to higher fuel costs.",
      "\u201cWe need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets,\u201d Stein added.",
      "At least 17 other states, most of them controlled by Democrats, have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "Environmentalists praised Stein's action and urged lawmakers to uphold the veto. \u201cStand instead for affordable energy and economic opportunity for all,\u201d said Dan Crawford of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters.",
      "Donald Bryson of the conservative-leaning John Locke Foundation urged an override, saying Stein \u201chas chosen ideology over affordability.\u201d",
      "Another vetoed measure Wednesday attempted to clarify and adjust powers of the state auditor \u2014 currently Republican Dave Boliek \u2014 including his ability to investigate alleged improper governmental activities of individuals, nonprofits and other groups that receive government funds.",
      "Stein's veto message said the auditor's \u201csweeping access\u201d in the bill to records of \u201cany private corporation that accepts any amount of state funding\u201d could undermine business recruitment efforts.",
      "Boliek said in a statement that Stein's veto \u201cundercuts the important principles of accountability and transparency that taxpayers expect from their government.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A military veteran was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for plotting to attack an FBI office and assassinate law enforcement officers in retaliation for his arrest on charges that he was part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, court records show.",
      "Edward Kelley was one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol. Nearly two years later, Kelley made plans with another man to attack the FBI office in Knoxville, Tennessee, using improvised explosive devices attached to vehicles and drones, according to prosecutors.",
      "Last November, a jury convicted Kelley of conspiring to murder federal employees, solicitation to commit a crime of violence and influencing federal officials by threat.",
      "Kelley, 36, received a pardon from President Donald Trump for his Jan. 6 convictions, but a judge agreed with prosecutors that Trump's action did not extend to Kelley's Tennessee case. That makes Kelley, who is from Maryvale, Tennessee, one of only a few Capitol riot defendants remaining in prison after the Republican president's sweeping act of clemency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Thomas Varlan handed down Kelley's life sentence during a hearing in Knoxville, according to court records. The judge denied a request for Kelley to be released pending the outcome of an appeal.",
      "Prosecutors had recommended a life sentence for Kelley, saying he was remorseless and incapable of rehabilitation.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Kelley served in the Marine Corps for eight years. He was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan before his 2015 discharge from the military.",
      "On Jan. 6, 2021, Kelley was captured on video helping two other rioters throw a Capitol Police officer onto the ground and using a piece of wood to damage a window, according to the FBI. He was the fourth person to enter the Capitol through a broken window, the FBI said.",
      "After a trial without a jury, a federal judge in Washington convicted Kelley last November of 11 counts stemming from the riot. Before Kelley could be sentenced, Trump pardoned him and hundreds of other convicted Capitol rioters.",
      "Kelley argued that his pardon was broad enough to cover his conduct in the Tennessee case, but the judge disagreed. Varlan said Kelley's crimes in the Tennessee case were separated from Kelley's conduct on Jan. 6 \u201cby years and miles.\u201d Prosecutors reached the same conclusion.",
      "In other Jan. 6 cases, however, Trump's Justice Department has argued that the pardons apply to separate convictions. For instance, prosecutors concluded that a Kentucky man's pardon for storming the Capitol also covered his conviction for illegally possessing guns when FBI agents searched his home for the Jan. 6 investigation.",
      "Kelley has been jailed since December 2022. His lawyer, Mark Brown, said Kelley did not hurt anybody or directly threaten anybody with violence. Brown urged the judge to reject prosecutors' request to apply a \u201cterrorism enhancement\u201d in calculating his client's sentence.",
      "\u201cKelley does not deserve the same sentence as an actual \u2018terrorist\u2019 who injured or killed hundreds or thousands of America citizens,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Kelley's co-defendant, Austin Carter, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in January 2024. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 4.",
      "Kelley created a list of 36 law-enforcement officers to target for assassination and shared it with Carter, calling it their first \u201cmission,\u201d according to prosecutors. All the officers were involved in Kelley's May 2022 arrest on Capitol riot charges and the FBI's search of his home.",
      "\u201cThe proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Kelley, Carter and a third man used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss plans, prosecutors said. Carter testified that he met with Kelley to conduct military-style training in November 2022.",

      "Kelley's attorney said the case involved \u201clittle to no planning.\u201d",

      "An empty hospital in Williamston, North Carolina, offers an evocative illustration of why Republican Sen. Thom Tillis would buck his party and its leaders to vote down President Trump\u2019s signature domestic policy package",
      "WASHINGTON -- Though patients don't rush through the doors of this emergency room anymore, an empty hospital in Williamston, North Carolina, offers an evocative illustration of why Republican Sen. Thom Tillis would buck his party leaders to vote down President Donald Trump's signature domestic policy package.",
      "Martin General is one of a dozen hospitals that have closed in North Carolina over the last two decades. This is a problem that hospital systems and health experts warn may only worsen if the legislation passes with its $1 trillion cuts to the Medicaid program and new restrictions on enrollment in the coverage.",
      "Tillis' home state showcases the financial impact that more Medicaid dollars can have on hospitals in rural and poor regions throughout the country. Tillis said in a floor speech on Sunday, explaining his vote, that the GOP bill will siphon billions of dollars from Medicaid recipients and the health system in his state.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise,\u201d said Tillis, who has announced he will not seek re-election because of his opposition to the bill. Along with Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky, he joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "Tillis later accused the president and his colleagues of not fully grasping the full impact of the bill: \u201cWe owe it to the states to do the work to understand how these proposals affect them. How hard is that? I did it.\u201d",
      "For Martin General Hospital in Williamston, North Carolina\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid came just too late. The emergency room abruptly closed its doors in the eastern North Carolina county that's home to more than 20,000 people in August 2023. The closest hospital is now about a 30-minute drive away.",

      "North Carolina began offering Medicaid expansion to its residents in December. Today, more than 673,000 people are receiving this coverage.",
      "Now, Tillis and other state officials are worried the Republican bill, which will limit how much Medicaid money is sent back to providers, threatens funds for hospitals in their state again. And it could trigger a state Medicaid law that would close down North Carolina's otherwise successful expansion of coverage unless state legislators make changes or locate funds.",

      "Cardinal Robert Prevost made history by becoming the first pope from the United States \u2014 a stunning decision that Chicagoans celebrated by flocking to churches and sharing memes.",
      "Prevost was born in 1955 in the South Side Chicago neighborhood of Bronzeville and grew up in suburban Dolton, near St. Mary of the Assumption, where he attended Mass and elementary school. He later studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in the Hyde Park neighborhood and taught in local Catholic schools, including at St. Rita High School.",
      "Dolton Mayor Jason House called purchasing the pope's childhood home a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d during a Tuesday meeting of the Dolton Village Board. The childhood homes of other popes have often been turned into museums or pilgrimage sites.",

      "Yet several residents at Tuesday's meeting were skeptical about any benefit to taxpayers, questioning whether the financially strained village could afford to purchase the home and maintain the streets surrounding it.",
      "The board hired former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to probe the village\u2019s finances last year, and she found Dolton\u2019s bank accounts had been depleted. The village was $3.65 million in debt and had unpaid bills piling up.",

      "\u201cWe can either seize this moment going forward or we can let that moment go to an investor,\" House said. \u201cI would like our community to get the benefit of this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Other board members echoed the mayor's excitement over the purchase, as some spoke of how the childhood homes of Michael Jackson and Martin Luther King Jr. offered economic opportunity to their communities. A recent post on the village's Facebook account showed workers repairing the house's roof and celebrated the home for \u201cbringing new energy and attention to our village.\u201d",
      "Gino Ferrari, president of Windy City Construction Group, said he offered the full roof replacement for free to the current owner, saying he \u201cwanted to make sure this roof lasts a long time.\u201d In front of the home, the company put up a sign with an image of Pope Leo XIV and the words \u201dPope Leo's childhood home\" and \u201cA roof for the pope's roots.\u201d",
      "As crews worked on the roof Tuesday, they chatted with neighbors who offered them water and bike riders who traveled along the lakefront from Chicago to see the house.",
      "\u201cDolton has been through a lot in the last few years, so this is such a great, positive moment for Dolton,\" Ferrari said. \"The community seems pretty excited.\u201d",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s liberal majority struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban on Wednesday, ruling 4-3 that it was superseded by a newer state law that criminalizes abortions only after a fetus can survive outside the womb.",
      "State lawmakers adopted the ban in 1849, making it a felony when anyone other than the mother \u201cintentionally destroys the life of an unborn child.\u201d",
      "It was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never officially repealed the ban, however, and conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision to overturn Roe reactivated it.",
      "Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit that year arguing that the ban was trumped by abortion restrictions legislators enacted during the nearly half-century that Roe was in effect. Kaul specifically cited a 1985 law that essentially permits abortions until viability. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, defended the ban in court, arguing that the 1849 ban could coexist with the newer abortion restrictions, just as different penalties for the same crime coexist.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled in 2023 that the 1849 ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. Abortions have been available in the state since that ruling but the state Supreme Court decision gives providers and patients more certainty that abortions will remain legal in Wisconsin.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a decision from a lower appellate court. It was expected as soon as the justices took the case that they would overturn the ban. Liberals hold a 4-3 majority on the court and one of them, Janet Protasiewicz, openly stated on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Democratic-backed Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel for an open seat on the court in April, ensuring liberals will maintain their 4-3 edge until at least 2028. Crawford has not been sworn in yet and was not part of Wednesday\u2019s ruling. She\u2019ll play pivotal role, though, in a separate Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin lawsuit challenging the 1849 ban\u2019s constitutionality. The high court decided last year to take that case. It\u2019s still pending.",

      "The saguaro cactus is the iconic plant of the Arizona borderlands, and in June and early July, its fruit ripens",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Cousins Tanisha Tucker Lohse and Maria Francisco set off from their desert camp around dawn on most early summer days, in search of ripe fruit from the towering saguaro cactus, an icon of the Southwest that is crucial to the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u2019s spirituality.",
      "One plucks the small, thorn-covered fruits called \u201cbahidaj\u201d with a 10-foot-long (3-meter-long) stick made with a saguaro rib as the other catches them in a bucket. The harvest ritual is sacred to the O\u2019odham, who have lived for thousands of years in what are now U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and it's enjoying a renaissance as many seek to protect their traditional way of life.",
      "The fruit collected in late June is central to annual summer rain ceremonies, which mark the New Year. The laborious, weekslong harvest process also reinforces crucial connections to the Creator, the natural environment and fellow O\u2019odham across generations.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m surrounded by all the people that were here before us, all the ancestors,\u201d Francisco said in a desert wash lined with saguaros, flowering creosote bushes and spiny cholla cacti. \u201cWe talk about them constantly when we\u2019re out here.\u201d",
      "Foremost for the cousins' extended family is \u201cGrandma Juana.\u201d In the 1960s, elder Juanita Ahil campaigned to preserve their access to the harvesting camp in the foothills west of Tucson after the land became part of Saguaro National Park. Tucker Lohse\u2019s late mother, Stella Tucker, carried on the harvesting tradition that\u2019s now organized by the two cousins.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking on a big responsibility, a big legacy,\u201d said Tucker Lohse, who brought her 4-year-old daughter along this year. \u201cMy mom knows we\u2019re still here.\u201d",
      "Saguaros are the iconic plant of the Sonoran Desert, a land straddling the border between Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, that\u2019s surprisingly lush even though it receives less than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain yearly and summer temperatures routinely soar above 100 (38 degrees Celsius).",
      "The treelike cacti start to produce fruit at 30 years old, then sprout their trademark arms around 75 and live up to 200 years. Most of the fruit is near the top, which can be more than four times the average person\u2019s height, so the fruit of the tallest can be beyond their reach.",
      "They\u2019re an essential shelter and food source for desert creatures from mice to wrens, which is why harvesters \u2014 traces of whose camps date back to the 1500s \u2014 never pick them clean, Tucker Lohse said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t look at land and animals as a resource \u2014 we create a relationship,\u201d she said, echoing perspectives shared by Indigenous people across North and South America.",
      "For the O\u2019odham, the saguaros, or \u201cha:sa\u00f1\u201d in their language, provide far more than food, tools and shelter material \u2014 they\u2019re family.",
      "\u201cHa:sa\u00f1 to us are like people, and we respect them that way,\u201d said Silas Garcia, Francisco's partner. He started harvesting as a child with his aunt on the O\u2019odham reservation, which is one of the largest in the United States.",
      "Garcia said there is a specific creation story about the saguaros \u2014 though like many stories sacred to Native Americans, it cannot be told in summer \u2014 and their spiritual presence makes the harvest central to the O\u2019odham.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s being reconnected to the desert, to who I am, to where our stories talk about where we come from as a people,\u201d Garcia said as he built a mesquite wood fire to boil the sugary fruit pulp into syrup.",
      "Starting in May, O\u2019odham families check the saguaro buds. The fruit is usually ripe by mid-June, opening a one-to-four week harvesting window until the fruit is spoiled by the first summer monsoons.",
      "After picking the first fruit, harvesters praise the Creator, believed to reside in a nearby mountain peak, the Baboquivari, that has been the site of many rescues of migrants who tried to evade U.S. border authorities.",
      "Then they bless themselves with some of the pulp, often making a cross-like sign over their foreheads and hearts \u2014 for some, a reference to Christian beliefs many O'odham also embrace. They taste it and thank the saguaro for providing for them.",
      "When it\u2019s cut open \u2014 using the saguaro\u2019s dried-up flower as a knife and leaving the pods by the saguaro for animals \u2014 the fruit is the color of a ripe watermelon. It changes shades from fuchsia to blood red as it\u2019s processed at camp.",
      "After the pulp is boiled for about an hour, it\u2019s strained to remove any debris, fiber and seeds. The latter two are collected into patties that, after being dried in the relentless sun, make natural pectin for saguaro jam. Then the juice is cooked again, reducing it to a syrup, and its flowery, caramel-like smell pervades the camp.",
      "Since the syrup is one-tenth the quantity of the harvested fruit pulp, it takes a pair of harvesters about 10 hours in the desert to get enough to make 64 ounces (1.9 liters) of syrup.",
      "Finally, a bit of syrup is mixed with water and left to ferment to make wine for Nawait I\u2019i. That\u2019s the dayslong ceremony in which O\u2019odham pray together to their Creator to keep sending the monsoon rains that make it possible to plant traditional crops like beans, squash and corn.",
      "For many Native Americans, losing access to land, natural cycles of agriculture and the local foods that sustained them for centuries has meant spiking rates of diabetes, alcoholism and other diseases that disproportionately plague their communities.",
      "Too many elders lost their lives this way, putting at risk their language and traditions and more of their land.",
      "\u201cI watched them slowly pass away and no one took over,\u201d Tucker Lohse said. That\u2019s why she, Francisco and others push to teach youth about saguaro harvesting and other practices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really proud Maria has picked it up,\u201d said Francisco\u2019s mother, Josephine Ramon, adding that she\u2019s relearning some traditions she was taught as a child from her daughter.",
      "Ramon said she regrets not teaching the language to younger family members who lived off the reservation, as about one third of the nation\u2019s 30,000 members do.",

Michael was a car mechanic when we started rehearsals. He wrote long handwritten letters to me for years about how art saved his life. He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",
      "He is perhaps best known for his role as Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the iconic scene in which he tortures a police officer while the 1973 Stealers Wheel hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background.",

      "Madsen also referenced \"mistakes\" he had made in his life during that speech, which was mainly addressed to his wife, DeAnna Morgan.

    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years.",
      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend \"Jane,\" the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",

      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly two months of testimony, dozens of witnesses and mountains of evidence presented, jurors found Sean \"Diddy\" Combs not guilty\u00a0of the three most serious charges against him and guilty of two lesser prostitution-related charges.",
      "Moments after the verdict was read, Combs fell to his knees and prayed in court, leaning on his chair.",
      "How did Combs react when the verdict was read?",
      "\"Sean Combs pumped his fist at one point when they said that first 'not guilty.' When the jury foreperson, that's juror number five, was the one who was reading the verdict, he pumped his fist,\" CBS News New York's Alice Gainer said. \"After the verdict was read and once everyone, the judge and the jury, left the courtroom, man, the applause was thunderous from his family.\"",
      "Combs' three daughters, his sons, his mother, other family and friends, and supporters were in the courtroom Wednesday.",
      "\"They were just cheering. He was clapping. And it's such an interesting visual, because, again, he's by the defense table. It's not like he can run up and hug them. He's not a free man. He was convicted of two of the five counts,\" Gainer said.",
      "Combs' mother gave a thumb's up outside court.",
      "High interest surrounding the case",
      "Gainer has covered numerous high-profile cases, such as the recent Harvey Weinstein retrial. But she said the Combs trial garnered a different level of interest.",
      "\"There's just so much going on, and there's such huge interest in this case. It's like nothing I've ever seen before, actually,\" Gainer said. \"I get asked so many questions. People on social media are so interested. They are following me now to try and see our daily updates we've been posting on Instagram.\"",
      "\"I've never seen crowds of this magnitude throughout the trial -- not just at openings or closings and verdict day. There's been a steady stream of people here curious about it, like I said before, streaming about it, giving their own personal takes on what's been going on. They had to set up multiple overflow rooms at one point just to make sure they could meet the demand. Because not everyone could get into the main courtroom, so they have these overflow rooms set up with a feed of what's going on in the main courtroom that people can then watch themselves,\" Gainer added.",

      "The panel of eight men and four women entered the third day of deliberations at U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan, having arrived at a decision Tuesday on two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, the latter concerning allegations of arranging to fly women and sex workers across state lines.",
      "It remains unclear whether the jury found Combs guilty or not guilty of those four counts. Before the results of the verdict can be announced, jurors will have to decide on count 1 of racketeering conspiracy.",

      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1. The foreman told Judge Arun Subramanian that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because they had jurors \"with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\" The judge told them to keep deliberating, and the jurors were later dismissed for the day.",
      "According to the jury's verdict sheet, there are eight acts under the federal racketeering conspiracy charge: kidnapping, arson, bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, sex trafficking, transportation and inducement to travel for purposes of prostitution, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.",
      "\"The RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] charge is the most serious, the most complex, the most elements, the most difficult to prove and, frankly, the most confusing,\" legal expert Richard Schoenstein, the vice chair of litigation practice at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, told CBS New York. \"So it doesn't surprise me at all that would be the count that they're currently undecided on.\"",
      "Jurors reached their partial verdict on the four counts Tuesday after\u00a0requesting to review some of the testimony from Combs' former longtime girlfriend and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura and a male escort allegedly involved in so-called \"freak-offs.\" It came after less than 13 hours of deliberations across two days.

    "story": [
      "Update: Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was convicted of prostitution-related offenses but acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges on Wednesday, July 2. Read the story here. Our earlier coverage is below.",
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York City said it reached a partial verdict in the case, but the judge told them they need to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1, racketeering conspiracy. The note indicated there are jurors with unpersuadable opinions on that charge.",
      "After discussing the options with attorneys for both sides, Judge Arun Subramanian asked the jury to keep deliberating on the remaining charge, which is what prosecutors and defense attorneys asked for.",
      "Court then ended for the day. The jury will return to continue deliberations at 9 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "After the note from the jury was brought to court, Combs was seated with his attorneys surrounding him, standing in a half-circle. Combs appeared to be praying with his head bowed and hands folded on his lap. Combs wiped and rubbed his eyes, but it wasn't clear if he was crying.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday.",
      "What are the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "A sweeping grand jury indictment against Combs, 55, was unsealed in September 2024, initially charging the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at an upscale midtown Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "The charges against Combs are one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs' attorneys didn't call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" and \"hotel nights\"",
      "The high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.",
      "Ventura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the \"freak-offs\" to make Combs happy.",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",

The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",

      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",

      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

    "summary": "The BBC says it regrets not cutting off the Glastonbury festival live stream of punk-rap duo Bob Vylan's performance, which included an anti-Israel chant.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 The BBC has said it regrets not pulling down its live stream of a performance at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend that included what the broadcaster calls \"utterly unacceptable\" chants against Israel's military.",
      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",
      "Kneecap's members have insisted that they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah.\"",
      "They sent \"heartfelt apologies\" to the families of two British lawmakers who were murdered in recent years after their remarks about Conservative parliamentarians.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",

      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",

    "story": [
      "Former NFL player Corey Parchman appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday to discuss his new book \"IVF Playbook for Men,\" sharing his personal experience with infertility and advocating for greater awareness of male fertility issues.",
      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market means solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",

    "summary": "Trump administration faces pressure to clinch more trade deals, with a temporary tariff freeze on dozens of countries set to expire.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he does not plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:55:26 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

      "Tariff hit",
      "An economic slowdown and rocky financial markets has led companies to shed more than 154,000 jobs this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024.",
      "\"Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. \"If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry.\"",

      "\"We can't find a source outside of China for our potentiometer, which is critical for our designs,\" Keeley said. \"Even when we call companies in Taiwan, they say they get theirs from China.\"",
      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paramount will settle President Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million, the company announced late Tuesday.",
      "CBS News' parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and the plaintiffs' fees and costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.",
      "The settlement did not include an apology.",
      "Paramount also agreed that \"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawsuit, filed last October when he was still a candidate for president, was widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment. He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",
      "Weeks later, Wendy McMahon, who served as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, announced she was also departing. \"It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on a path forward,\" she wrote in a note to staffers.",
      "First Amendment scholars and constitutional experts largely viewed the lawsuit as a frivolous misapplication of the law.",
      "Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, explained, \"That statute is about sales \u2014 a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"",
      "Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Noah Feldman called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"",
      "Politicians had also spoken out about the suit, urging Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone not to settle. The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",
      "The FCC's approval is necessary for Paramount's $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media to move ahead, and the agency didn't make a decision on the transaction by the informal 180-day deadline to review mergers, which passed in May. Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",
      "If completed, the Paramount-Skydance merger will cap off a long, turbulent sales process that attracted multiple potential bidders. Talks between Skydance and Paramount's corporate parent, National Amusements, were briefly called off before the sides resumed negotiations and clinched a deal in July 2024.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:17:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

      "\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact \u2014 in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",
      "The president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.",
      "Although Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.",
      "The Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans \u2014 steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.",
      "\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\"",

      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips could soon come to fruition after the Senate passed President Trump's massive budget package.",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "Senators narrowly approved the legislation, which Republicans call the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" on July 1 by a vote of 51-50. The measure now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the bill and urged lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk, the world's richest person, reignited his criticism Monday of the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package working its way through the Senate on Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the Trump-backed bill.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0lashed out at Musk in an early Tuesday morning Truth Social post that noted Tesla has benefitted from federal electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 a program the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would phase out. The president also suggested DOGE should \"take a good, hard, look at\" other subsidies Musk has benefitted from.",
      "\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Musk responded to Mr. Trump's message: \"I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.\"",
      "Why is Musk opposed to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"?",
      "Many of Musk's criticisms zero in on the bill's price tag, calling its spending levels \"insane\" and attacking a provision in the Senate version of the bill that hikes the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "But the billionaire has also panned the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits and excise tax on certain renewable energy projects, calling those provisions \"utter madness\" that could \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.\"",
      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "Fireworks, a hallmark of July 4th celebrations, are feeling the impact of President Trump's trade war with China.",
      "More than 95% of the fireworks sold in the U.S. come from China, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And while sales of pyrotechnics have grown in past years as more states and counties loosen restrictions, tariffs have snarled some firework importers' plans this year.",
      "For retailers, the week before July 4 is the busiest time of the year for fireworks sales. In a normal year, shelves would be fully stocked. This year, with a 30% U.S. tariff in place on imports from China, fireworks fans may find a slimmer selection and higher prices.",
      "That's because some importers asked Chinese sellers to halt orders, when sky-high 145% U.S. tariffs were in place on China. A May trade truce between the countries lowered the the levy to 30%.",
      "\"The timing of the tariffs couldn't have hit at a worse time. The majority of U.S. importers told China, 'Do not ship our product, we can't afford to pay,\" Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, told CBS News. \"It's creating a supply-chain problem.",

      "\"The demand for women's basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \"This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league's extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women's professional basketball.\"",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\"This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \"Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\"",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock - the names of the previous teams - would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn't get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\"",

    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This tax provision was removed from the final version of the Senate bill that\u00a0passed on Tuesday, July 1. Read more here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

      "The final vote came after House GOP leadership scrambled Wednesday and into the wee hours Thursday to shore up support for the measure ahead of a key procedural vote to approve the rules for debate on the floor.",
      "Although Johnson spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May, the Senate made a number of tweaks that irked House members on a number of fronts \u2014 from its cuts to Medicaid to its impact on the deficit. Johnson acknowledged that the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred,\" though he repeatedly urged that the final product was largely what the House had signed off on in May.",
      "The Senate-passed bill included steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction that irked many House members. Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House pressured House Republicans to vote for the bill.",
      "The vote on the key procedural hurdle began around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and didn't wrap up until about 3:20 a.m. Thursday. Five House Republicans initially voted no on the rule, which would have been enough to tank the vote. But GOP leaders kept the vote open as they worked to shore up support, allowing lawmakers to change from no to yes.",
      "Johnson told reporters that Mr. Trump was \"directly engaged\" with skeptical members to get them onboard.",
      "\"Members wanted to hear certain assurances from him about what's ahead, what the future will entail, and what we're going to do next, and all of that,\" Johnson said. \"And he was very, very helpful in that process.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure over Truth Social as a handful of Republican holdouts didn't appear to be budging, declaring: \"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\"",
      "\"What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote shortly after midnight.",
      "The House ultimately voted 219 to 213 to advance the bill in a key victory for Republican leaders, who won the support of about a dozen GOP opponents to the rule. And when the vote finally came to an end, Fitzpatrick was the sole Republican opposed. He would also vote against final passage.",
      "Johnson told reporters that the breakthrough came amid help from the president, along with lengthy listening sessions with the bill's opponents, \"making sure that their concerns were addressed.\"",
      "\"A lot of people had to take the time to thoroughly go through the Senate's changes to our bill and that's fine,\" Johnson said. \"That was necessary to get them to yes.\"",
      "Ultimately, only Massie and Fitzpatrick bucked GOP leaders to vote against the legislation. Massie, a conservative, had drawn the ire of the president due to his stance against the bill for weeks. He said in a statement after Thursday's vote that he voted against it \"because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said that the Senate's changes to the initial House legislation were too drastic for him to support.",
      "\"[I]t was the Senate's amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community,\" the Pennsylvania Republican said in a statement, referring to his district. \"The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard. I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 There's no filibuster in the House, but Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway as the House debated President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" before it passed on Thursday.",
      "Jeffries held the House floor for more than eight hours, taking his \"sweet time\" with a marathon floor speech that delayed passage of Republicans' massive tax and spending cuts legislation and gave his minority party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an \"immoral\" bill.",
      "As Democratic leader, Jeffries can speak for as long as he wants during debate on legislation \u2014 hence its nickname on Capitol Hill, the \"magic minute,\" that lasts as long as leaders are speaking.",
      "He began the speech at 4:53 a.m. ET and finished at 1:37 p.m. ET, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, breaking the record set by then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California in 2021, when he was the GOP leader. McCarthy spoke for 8 hours, 32 minutes when he angrily criticized Democrats' \"Build Back Better\" legislation, breaking a record set by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, when she spoke about immigration for 8 hours, 7 minutes in 2018.",
      "\"I feel an obligation, Mr. Speaker, to stand on this House floor and take my sweet time,\" Jeffries said as he opened.",
      "The speech pushed a final vote on Mr. Trump's tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours. The New York Democrat used the time to criticize the bill's health care and food aid cuts, tax breaks for the wealthy and rollbacks to renewable energy programs, among other parts of the bill that Democrats decry.",
      "He also killed time by riffing on hip-hop, King George III and his own life story, among other diversions. He called out Republicans who have voiced concerns about the bill, read stories from people concerned about their health care from those GOP lawmakers' districts and praised his own members, some of whom sat behind him and cheered, clapped, laughed and joined hands.",
      "\"This reckless Republican budget is an immoral document, and that is why I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives with my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus to stand up and push back against it with everything we have,\" Jeffries said.",
      "He ended the speech in the cadence of a Sunday sermon, with most of the Democratic caucus in a tight huddle around him. One colleague called out, \"Bring it home, Hakeem!\"",
      "\"We don't work for President Donald Trump,\" Jeffries said, as a handful of Republicans across the aisle sat silent and occasionally snickered at the leader as he kept talking.",
      "He invoked the late John Lewis, a civil rights activist in the 1960s and longtime Democratic congressman from Georgia. \"Get into good trouble, necessary trouble,\" Jeffries said. \"We're going to press on until victory is won.\"",
      "Jeffries sneaked small bites of food and drank liquids to boost his energy, but did not leave the chamber or his podium. The speech would be over if he did.",
      "Democrats were powerless to stop the huge bill, which Republicans passed by using an obscure budget procedure that bypasses the Senate filibuster. So they were using the powers they did have, mostly to delay. In the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forced Senate clerks to read the bill for almost 16 hours over the weekend.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey similarly gained attention in April when he spoke for more than 25 hours on the Senate floor about the first months of Mr. Trump's presidency and broke the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history. Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, but Jeffries' \"magic minute\" did not allow for any interaction with other members.",
      "Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty. When the speech was over, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri, called it \"a bunch of hogwash.\"",
      "The speech \"will not change the outcome that you will see very shortly,\" Smith said.",
      "After the bill passed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Democrats \"wanted to speak for hours and hours and break records because they wanted to stand in the way of history.\"",

      "The call came after the White House confirmed earlier this week the U.S. is halting some weapons shipments to Ukraine. The Trump administration said the decision was made after a Pentagon review of U.S. military support and assistance to other countries. The pause was put in place because of concerns that U.S. military stockpiles were falling too low, a U.S. official said.",
      "The White House has not yet provided a readout of the conversation between the two leaders.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda Thursday, sending the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" to the president's desk ahead of a July 4 deadline.",
      "The House approved the bill in a 218 to 214 vote Thursday, after the Senate narrowly approved\u00a0the bill Tuesday in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "At the center the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was slated to sunset at the end of the year. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by significant cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own initial version of the legislation last month, with some key differences\u00a0to the final Senate-crafted version. The lower chamber approved the Senate's changes Thursday, sending the measure to the president's desk.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, wasn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules. The parliamentarian also weighed in on what's known as the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the initial House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the initial House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the initial House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Green energy policies",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",
      "It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems.",
      "The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities. Existing contracts and grants under the program are not affected.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the initial House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the initial House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress aimed to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the bill, $300 less than the initial House-passed hike.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The Senate\u00a0version\u00a0varies from the initial House-passed provisions on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the early House version was uncapped.",
      "Under the initial House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would have qualified for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version phases out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The bill seeks to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year.",
      "Tracy J.  Wholf and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Edward Kelley, who was the fourth U.S. Capitol rioter to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021, faced a separate prosecution for targeting federal agents while he was being investigated for his role in the Capitol attack.",
      "The Justice Department argued Kelley created a \"kill list\" of FBI agents and others who investigated his role in the Jan. 6 siege. Prosecutors said Kelley \"distributed this list \u2014 along with videos containing images of certain FBI employees identified on the list \u2014 to a co-conspirator as part of his 'mission.'\"",
      "A jury convicted Kelley of conspiracy charges in November, and a federal judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced Kelley to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "Though Kelley was among the more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants pardoned on January 20, 2025, the pardon did not extend to Kelley's conspiracy case in Tennessee. Last month, prosecutors argued, \"Edward Kelley is remorseless and has shown neither a capacity nor desire to rehabilitate. On the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination.\"",
      "Prosecutors also said, \"The proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home.\"",
      "They argued Kelley viewed \"the FBI as the enemy and, as such, were valid targets in the civil war because they served as the 'eyes and ears' of the government.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said, \"The defendant identified 36 individual federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel to target for assassination. He created a list of his targets which included names, titles, and cell phone numbers.\"",
      "Kelley is one of several Jan. 6 defendants who face prison time in separate criminal cases, including some who have been arrested again after their pardons were issued.",
      "A Florida defendant was arrested later in January 2025 on a gun charge. A Texas defendant who was freed from prison by the Trump pardon was later arrested, suspected of attempted child solicitation.",
      "Kelley's role on Jan. 6, 2021, was distinct. Security camera photos showed he was the fourth person to unlawfully enter the Capitol building at the forefront of the mob and he was accused of being part of a group that assaulted an officer. He was also among the group that confronted lone officer Eugene Goodman outside the U.S. Senate chamber as Senators evacuated to safety.",
      "The Justice Department press release issued Tuesday to announce Kelley's prison sentence did not make a reference to Jan. 6. Prior announcements in his case, from 2022, specified Kelley's alleged role in the Capitol siege.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence arm plans to cut nearly three-quarters of its full-time employees, shaving its Office of Intelligence & Analysis down from about 1,000 staff to just 275, according to four sources briefed on the matter.",
      "The exact timing of the cuts remains unclear; sources tell CBS News the staff reductions have been in the works for months but were temporarily on hold because of rising tensions overseas after the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The decision has raised concerns among the nation's police and intelligence gathering agencies, as the U.S. reckons with a heightened threat environment.",
      "DHS' Office of Intelligence & Analysis \u2014 created after the September 11 terrorist attacks \u2014 is the only member of the U.S. intelligence community tasked with sharing threat information to state, local, tribal and territorial governments across the country.",
      "A DHS spokesperson confirmed the cuts in a statement, saying the department is getting \"back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.\"",
      "\"DHS component leads have identified redundant positions and non-critical programs within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Department is actively working to identify other wasteful positions and programs that do not align with DHS's mission to prioritize American safety and enforce our laws.\"",
      "Last month, the current head of the agency, Daniel Tamburello, informed the intelligence agency's workforce that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had signed off on plans to slash the agency by hundreds of employees, with others reassigned to other DHS components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "This week, House and Senate lawmakers wrote to Noem and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, warning them to avoid \"this drastic and unilateral step and instead to consult with Congress about alternative ways to make I&A as effective and efficient as possible.\"",
      "\"At a time when DHS is rightly warning about an elevated threat environment from terrorists and cartels, we should be focused on plugging security gaps rather than senselessly creating new ones,\" Democratic Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Jim Himes of Connecticut wrote Wednesday, along with Michigan Sen. Gary Peters and minority leaders on the House Homeland Security Committee, House Intelligence Committee and Senate Homeland Security Committee.",
      "Several law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, County Sheriffs of America and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies \u2014 also penned a letter to Noem, pressing her to reconsider. They warned that any downsizing of the intelligence agency could prevent \"vital intelligence\" from reaching the officers and investigators whose job it is to detect and disrupt threats and could create \"dangerous blind spots in our homeland security network.\"",
      "\"[Intelligence and Analysis] is the only component of the U.S. intelligence community with a statutory mandate to share threat information with state and local partners,\" the letter stated. \"The current threat landscape makes our partnership with [Intelligence and Analysis] more critical than ever. Ongoing Middle East conflicts heighten risks of foreign-directed and homegrown violent extremism, as demonstrated by the recent antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado. Transnational criminal organizations continue to shift fentanyl trafficking routes, requiring real time intelligence to intercept deadly substances before they reach our streets\u2026 Weakening [Intelligence & Analysis] would undermine our ability to detect and prevent threats before they occur.\"",
      "Mike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, a network of 2,000 public safety officials operating as hubs of information sharing and threat analysis for local law enforcement, also wrote to congressional leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last month. He warned that \"any reduction in [Intelligence and Analysis'] field-based presence, staffing, or engagement capabilities would negatively impact the critical information flow and coordination necessary to identify and mitigate emerging threats to our communities.\"",
      "Leaders within the National Sheriffs' Associations had a similar message for congressional leaders last month, writing in a letter to GOP Rep.

    "summary": "The FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers about COVID shot approvals.",
    "story": [
      "Top-ranking Food and Drug Administration officials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.",
      "In a memorandum following Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.",
      "Prasad was named earlier this year to replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad was later elevated to the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "Novavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.",
      "Prasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"",
      "\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.",
      "A separate memo released by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.",
      "The agency's career scientists had initially concluded on April 1 that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.",
      "\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.",
      "Documents released last month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.",
      "\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"",
      "The New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.",
      "Under Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.",
      "\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had said at an event last year.",
      "In past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, who questioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials \u2014 Dr. Phil Krause \u2014 is also now criticizing moves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.",
      "Agency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.",
      "Months before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.",
      "Hoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"",
      "\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political \u2014 it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.",
      "Makary and Prasad also made this argument in May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.",
      "The FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.",
      "Health care providers are also allowed to give vaccines \"off-label\" outside of the FDA's label and CDC recommendations, once the FDA has approved sales, though that risks running afoul of insurance coverage and liability protections.",

    "summary": "Trump administration faces pressure to clinch more trade deals, with a temporary tariff freeze on dozens of countries set to expire.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he does not plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will take up cases involving laws in Idaho and West Virginia that prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will consider whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, setting up a high-profile clash that could have far-reaching implications across the country.",
      "The justices agreed to decide whether laws from Idaho and West Virginia that prevent transgender girls and women from competing in female athletics violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. The cases involving transgender rights come after the court's conservative majority upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors last month.",
      "Beginning in its next term in October, the Supreme Court will review lower court decisions in favor of transgender athletes from Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the bans in their respective states. The Idaho case involves the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, while the dispute over West Virginia's law involves the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "The issue of transgender athletes participating in girls' and women's sports has exploded at the state level in recent years. Idaho was the first state to pass a law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in women and girls' sports, and two dozen have since followed suit. Roughly half of the states have also passed laws that bar certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "At the federal level, President Trump signed an executive order in February that aimed to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The president's order directs that under Title IX, educational institutions that receive federal funds cannot \"deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.\"",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's executive order, the NCAA announced it had updated its participation policy for transgender athletes to bar student-athletes who were assigned male at birth from competing on women's teams. On Wednesday, the University of Pennsylvania said it would no longer allow transgender athletes\u00a0to participate in women's sports as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school after it awarded Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, a spot on the women's swimming team.",
      "\"Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,\" said Joshua Block of the ACLU, which is representing the athletes in the cases, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson. \"We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.\"",
      "West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey said he is confident the Supreme Court will uphold his state's law.",
      "\"It's a great day, as female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \"The people of West Virginia know that it's unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that's why we passed this commonsense law preserving women's sports for women.\"",
      "Idaho's law",
      "Idaho's measure, called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, requires athletic teams or sports to be designated based on biological sex, and says those for women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\" If there is any dispute about a student's sex, the law says schools must ask for a health examination and consent form verifying the student's biological sex.",
      "After Idaho's GOP-led legislature passed the legislation, Hecox, a transgender woman who was attending Boise State University, sued, arguing the law violates Title IX and the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law. Hecox was a freshman when she filed her lawsuit in April 2020, and she said she wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore, but couldn't do so because of Idaho's ban.",
      "Hecox has received treatment for gender dysphoria since 2019, including testosterone suppression and estrogen, according to court papers.",
      "A federal district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding that Hecox was likely to succeed in her challenge. U.S. District Judge David Nye wrote in August 2020 that the ban \"on its face discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\"",
      "Additionally, Nye found the measure discriminates against transgender women by categorically excluding them from female sports and subjects participants in female athletics to a \"potentially invasive\" process for verifying a student's biological sex.",
      "As a result of the district court's order, Hecox tried out for the women's NCAA running teams at Boise State, but did not qualify. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running at the university, according to court filings.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the district court's injunction as applied to Hecox, finding that Idaho's ban targets all transgender girls and women regardless of their testosterone levels or whether they have received certain gender-transition treatments.",
      "The appeals court said that the record in the case doesn't back \"the conclusion that all transgender women, including those like Lindsay who receive hormone therapy, have a physiological advantage over cisgender women.\"",
      "The West Virginia law",
      "West Virginia's legislature passed its law, the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021, which restricts participation on girls' sports teams based on biological sex, defined as a student's \"reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" The law prohibits transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports at every level, including club and intramural activities.",
      "State officials have argued the law aims to protect equality in girls' sports, and it does not prevent anyone from trying out for men's, boys' or co-ed teams.",
      "\"It is only when students are playing skill and contact sports \u2014 where biological sex has a direct effect\u2014\u00a0 that biological males (again, however they might identify) cannot compete with females,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson, who was then 11 years old, challenged the measure, arguing it is unconstitutional and violates Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Pepper-Jackson, now a teenager, was born male but began identifying as female at \"an early age,\" lawyers wrote in court papers. She has received puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy.\u00a0 When Pepper-Jackson was a rising sixth grader and preparing to begin middle school, she was informed by her school's principal that she could not participate in girls' school sports because of West Virginia's law.",
      "A federal judge in July 2022 temporarily blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling its application would likely violate Title IX and the Constitution. As a result of the injunction, she was able to participate in her middle school girls' cross-country and track-and-field teams.",
      "In early 2023, U.S. District judge Joseph Goodwin ruled for the state and upheld the law. He also lifted the earlier injunction that had blocked enforcement against Pepper-Jackson.",
      "\"A transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically,\" he wrote. \"The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.\"",
      "Pepper-Jackson appealed and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit for emergency relief, which would've allowed her to participate in the spring 2023 track-and-field season. The appeals court granted her request, after which West Virginia officials sought the Supreme Court's intervention. The high court then denied the state's bid to allow it to enforce the law against Pepper-Jackson, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissenting.",
      "A divided 4th Circuit issued a ruling on the merits of the case in April 2024, finding West Virginia's law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Citing Pepper-Jackson's years-long identity as a girl, social transition, name change, updated birth certificate listing her as a female and medical treatments, the 4th Circuit's majority said offering her a \"'choice' between not participating in sports and participating only on boys teams is no real choice at all.\"",
      "\"By participating on boys teams, B.P.J. would be sharing the field with boys who are larger, stronger, and faster than her because of the elevated levels of circulating testosterone she lacks,\" Judge Toby Heytens wrote. \"The act thus exposes B.P.J. to the very harms Title IX is meant to prevent by effectively 'exclud[ing]' her from 'participation in' all non-coed sports entirely.\"",
      "But in their appeal to the Supreme Court, West Virginia officials argued that the 4th Circuit's decision threatens Title IX's promise of equal athletic opportunity for women and girls.",
      "\"In the Fourth Circuit, females must now compete against biological males \u2014 and all the physiological advantages they possess \u2014 in all athletic events,\" lawyers for the state wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argued it's too soon for the Supreme Court to weigh in, as the 4th Circuit's decision is the first and only from a federal appeals court to address Title IX's protections for transgender athletes.",

      "In rejecting the appeal from Montana state officials, the high court turned away what the officials said was a chance to clarify the scope of parents' right to be informed of and participate in their children's medical decisions, including abortion.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote a separate statement respecting the court's decision not to take up the case. Alito said the case is a \"poor vehicle\" for deciding the question at hand.",

The law allows a minor who cannot get parental consent to access abortion care through a court order.",

      "The case languished for several years until the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade. A state trial court ruled that the consent requirement violated the Montana Constitution because it interfered with a minor's right to privacy.",
      "The state appealed, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the district court's decision. It found that when evaluated under the most stringent level of judicial review, strict scrutiny, the consent law was not narrowly tailored to any of Montana's compelling interests that they said justified the requirement.",
      "The consent rule, the state supreme court found, violates the \"fundamental right of a minor to control her body and destiny,\" as guaranteed by the state constitution.",
      "Montana officials asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the state court's decision earlier this year and warned that its view of a minor's right to privacy under the state constitution threatens parental rights under the federal Constitution to direct their child's medical care, including decisions about abortion and access to contraception.",
      "\"State experimentation with the scope of a minor's state constitutional right to seek an abortion threatens to erode parents' federal fundamental rights,\" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen wrote in urging the Supreme Court to take up the appeal.",
      "State officials are asking the justices to decide whether a fundamental right to direct the care and custody of their children includes a right to \"know and participate in decisions\" about their medical care, including getting an abortion.",
      "But lawyers for Planned Parenthood urged the high court to turn away the case because it involves unique provisions of Montana's Constitution \u2014 one that grants all Montana citizens the right to individual privacy and a second that guarantees minors the same state constitutional rights as adults.",
      "State officials, they wrote in a filing,\u00a0\"seek to use the parental right as a cudgel against a minor's rights.\"",
      "\"The court's protection of a minor's right to privacy is not any less of a deserving counterweight to the federal Constitution's guarantee of parental rights, simply because that protection inheres in Montana's constitution,\" Planned Parenthood lawyers wrote.",
      "The Montana Supreme Court recognized the right to abortion under its constitution in 1999, and it is legal up to the point of fetal viability. In the 2024 election, Montana voters approved an initiative that amended the state constitution to \"expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.\"",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia says he faced \"psychological torture\" in a prison in El Salvador, following his mistaken deportation to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 the man whose mistaken deportation by the Trump administration has fueled a monthslong legal saga \u2014 alleged Wednesday that he faced \"psychological torture\" and \"severe beatings\" after he was sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "The new allegations emerged in a legal filing by attorneys for Abrego Garcia in Maryland federal court, seeking to amend his lawsuit against the Trump administration over his deportation. Abrego Garcia was flown back to the United States in early June \u2014 months after a Maryland judge ordered his return \u2014 and promptly charged with human smuggling in Tennessee, but his attorneys say they're concerned he could be deported again.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have previously described his more than three-week stint at El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, as \"torture.\"",
      "But Wednesday's court filing offers new allegations of his \"severe mistreatment,\" which Abrego Garcia says included \"severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture.\" He says he lost 31 pounds during his time in prison.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was part of a group\u00a0of more than\u00a0250 Venezuelan and Salvadoran men who were\u00a0deported\u00a0from the U.S. to El Salvador and held in CECOT in mid-March. Shortly after his arrival at the Salvadoran mega-prison, an official there said, \"Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn't leave,\" the court filing alleges.",
      "The filing states prison staff then forced Abrego Garcia to strip and change into a uniform, kicked him to make him hurry up, shaved his head and marched him to a cell while hitting him with batons \u2014 leaving him with \"visible bruises and lumps all over his body.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia says he was kept in a crowded, windowless cell with metal bunks and lights that remained on for 24 hours a day. In one case, Abrego Garcia and his cellmates were allegedly forced to kneel for nine hours, and were struck if they fell down.",
      "After more than three weeks, Abrego Garcia says he was transferred to a different area and was \"photographed with mattresses and better food\" in what he believed to be staged images.",
      "Abrego Garcia was eventually transferred to a different prison in early April, but he says he was still denied contact with his attorneys or family members.",
      "Early on during his time at CECOT, Abrego Garcia says prison staff sorted a group of inmates based on whether they had gang tattoos but acknowledged that wasn't the case for him, saying, \"Your tattoos are fine.\" The Trump administration has alleged in the past that Abrego Garcia has tattoos linking him to the gang MS-13, which his lawyers have strongly denied.",
      "Separately, Wednesday's court filing says U.S. immigration agents falsely told Abrego Garcia after his March arrest that he would be allowed to see a judge. Prior to his removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia said he \"repeatedly requested judicial review,\" but officials responded by \"deliberately misleading\" him, according to the court filing.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: \"This illegal alien is an MS-13 gang member, alleged human trafficker, and a domestic abuser. The media's sympathetic narrative about this criminal illegal gang member has completely fallen apart, yet they continue to peddle his sob story. We hear far too much about gang members and criminals' false sob stories and not enough about their victims.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has denied membership in MS-13. His wife sought and received a temporary protective order in 2021 after alleging domestic abuse, but the case was dismissed after she didn't appear at a hearing. She said earlier this year she \"acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar,\" and decided not to move forward with the process because they \"were able to work through this situation privately as a family.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers ask for his return to Maryland",
      "Wednesday's amended lawsuit asks U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to declare the Trump administration's actions unconstitutional and order Abrego Garcia's immediate return to Maryland. The suit also asks Xinis to reinstate a 2019 order that allowed Abrego Garcia to remain out of custody as long as he checks in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement regularly. He is currently being held in pretrial detention in Tennessee.",
      "Xinis has not ruled on Agrego Garcia's lawyers' request to file the amended lawsuit, which would update an earlier suit that led Xinis and the Supreme Court to order the government to \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S. That original lawsuit \u2014 filed in March \u2014 hinged partly on a 2019 court order barring Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador. The government said he was sent there anyway due to an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration asked Xinis last month to dismiss Abrego Garcia's lawsuit as moot, arguing he has already received the relief he requested because the government took \"extraordinary steps\" to return him to the U.S. The administration says Abrego Garcia \u2014 who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 \u2014 has \"no right to remain in the United States.\"",
      "A hearing in Xinis' courtroom is scheduled for Monday.",
      "Abrego Garcia is separately facing criminal smuggling charges in Tennessee, with federal prosecutors alleging he worked to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the U.S. for years. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty.",
      "A judge in Nashville ordered Abrego Garcia to be released ahead of trial last month, but his attorneys asked that he remain in custody, citing fears the Trump administration could detain and deport him on immigration grounds as soon as he leaves jail.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer said in Xinis' courtroom last week that once Abrego Garcia is released from detention, Immigration and Customs Enforcement intends to begin removal proceedings to send him to an unspecified \"third country\" other than El Salvador. The Justice Department maintains   there are \"no imminent plans\" to deport him.",

      "\"The man that left on January 6 was not the man that came home in the early hours of January 7,\" Smith told CBS News this week. \"He was a different person. His personality changed. His demeanor changed. He was there, but the man that I knew was not in the same body.\"",
      "The 35-year-old Smith died by suicide on Jan. 15, 2021, as he was driving to work for the first time since the Capitol riot.",
      "In 2022, Erin Smith filed a wrongful death lawsuit for assault and battery against 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, alleging that he had assaulted her husband during the Capitol riot.",
      "In January 2023, Walls-Kaufman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor federal count of \"parading, demonstrating and picketing in a Capitol building\" in connection with the insurrection. At the time, he acknowledged that he had \"scuffled\" with law enforcement, but did not face any federal assault charges in the case.",
      "He served 60 days in prison on that misdemeanor charge. He was one of hundreds of Capitol insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump in January.",
      "Despite the pardon, Smith's lawsuit went to trial in June. After a lengthy civil trial and just two hours of deliberations, a jury last week ordered Walls-Kaufman to pay her and her late husband's estate $500,000, finding that Walls-Kaufman had assaulted Jeffrey Smith on Jan. 6.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Walls-Kaufman denied striking Smith and called the lawsuit and the verdict \"sadistic.\"",
      "\"It felt like a relief, a relief that all the fighting was worth it, everything that I had done was worth it, and it proves that he was injured,\" Smith said of the jury's decision.",
      "Following her husband's death, Smith became a reluctant but impactful advocate. She successfully lobbied Congress to pass a bipartisan law in 2022 to allow some police deaths by suicide to be designated as \"official line of duty\" deaths.",
      "In March of that year, Washington's Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board officially ruled\u00a0that Smith's death was in the line of duty. Body camera footage obtained by CBS News appeared to show that Jeffrey Smith was the target of multiple assaults on Jan. 6. Those images helped Erin Smith have her husband's designation changed.",
      "Now, Smith is pressing the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington to add her late husband's name to its wall and include him in an honorary ceremony next May.",
      "She is also calling for the memorial to open eligibility for others for whom it's been officially determined to have died by suicide because of injuries on the job.",
      "\"Getting his name on there is not just for me,\" Smith said. \"It's also for his family, his friends, his partner, the people at the Metropolitan Police Department, his colleagues. And it's also for other officers who have died by suicide due to injuries that they also received at work.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of a group of migrants seeking asylum and three immigrants' rights groups.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Trump's plan to sharply restrict access to the nation's asylum system, a blow to the president's sweeping crackdown on immigration into the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of 13 individuals seeking asylum in the U.S. and three immigrants' rights groups who argued that a proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on his first day back in office \u2014 which has been a pillar of his immigration agenda \u2014 is unlawful.",
      "In his decision, Moss ruled that neither the Immigration and Nationality Act nor the Constitution give the president and administration officials \"the sweeping authority\" asserted in his proclamation and subsequent guidance implementing the directive.",
      "\"The court recognizes that the executive branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country,\" he wrote. \"But the INA, by its terms, provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country.\"",
      "Moss said that a pair of provisions of federal immigration law do not provide \"the president with the unilateral authority to limit the rights of aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum.\"",
      "He further found that the Constitution does not give the president the authority to \"adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted and the regulations that the responsible agencies have promulgated.\"",
      "In addition to finding Mr. Trump's plan to limit access to asylum, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request to certify a class of all people covered by the president's proclamation or its implementation who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "The judge postponed the effective date of his class-wide order for 14 days to give the Trump administration time to seek emergency relief from the federal appeals court in Washington. He also put off a decision on whether to certify a class of individuals who were subject to Mr. Trump's new asylum rules and are no longer in the U.S.",
      "\"The significance of the decision cannot be overstated,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs. \"The ruling not only means the U.S. will once again be a safe haven for those fleeing persecution but also reaffirms that the laws Congress enacts must be respected by the president.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has rolled out a series of plans aimed at targeting migrants in the U.S. His efforts began on the first day of his second term, when Mr. Trump took unilateral action to prevent most migrants crossing the southern border from applying for asylum or withholding of removal, a type of relief that prevents the Department of Homeland Security from deporting a migrant to their home country because of likely persecution.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation cited an alleged \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and directed administration officials to take action to \"repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States.\"",
      "The migrants and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration in early February and sought to block enforcement of the president's proclamation, arguing it is \"as unlawful as it is unprecedented.\"",
      "Moss, appointed by former President Barack Obama, held a hearing in April to consider their bid to invalidate the plan.",
      "In his decision, the judge found that neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and National Act authorize the changes in immigration law that Mr. Trump has sought to make.",
      "He wrote that the president \"lacks the inherent constitutional authority\" to supplant federal statutes governing removals.",
      "\"To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional,\" Moss wrote.",
      "As with his first term, immigration has remained a focal point of the president's second term, and he has undertaken a number of actions that he says are aimed at targeting the purported \"invasion\" at the southern border. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have sparked legal battles. Mr. Trump has invoked a 1798 wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua and has ended programs put in place by former President Joe Biden that shielded nearly 1 million migrants from the threat of deportation.",

      "DHS announced Friday that benefits will instead end in September, and unless migrants qualify for some other form of legal status, they will lose their right to work and may face deportation.",
      "In his ruling Tuesday, Hogan sided with a group of Haitian migrants who sued over the end to TPS for the Caribbean nation. The judge wrote that Noem \"does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation.\"",
      "Hogan said the DHS secretary \"cannot reconsider Haiti's TPS designation in a way that takes effect before February 3, 2026, the expiration of the most recent previous extension.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have enrolled in schools, taken jobs, and begun courses of medical treatment in the United States in reliance on Haiti's TPS designation lasting until at least February 3, 2026,\" Hogan wrote in the 23-page ruling.",

      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement the ruling \"delays justice and seeks to kneecap the President's constitutionally vested powers.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 11:51:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission were fired by President Trump in May.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to allow him to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The request to the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision earlier this month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028. The commission sets consumer product safety standards, can order product recalls and bring civil suits against companies.",
      "The three members were told in May that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Removal restrictions like those governing the Consumer Product Safety Commission have been put in place by Congress to insulate independent agencies from politics. But Mr. Trump has sought to test his removal powers through a series of firings targeting members of those entities.",
      "Following their firings, the commissioners sued and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid earlier this month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court is the third involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which the administration has argued is generally unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two federal independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court said in its unsigned decision that it \"reflects our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\"",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the earlier removals should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to act immediately and issue a brief administrative stay that would allow it more time to consider his request for emergency relief. Lawyers for the commissioners opposed that request for swift action, noting that they have been serving in their roles in the nearly three weeks since the district judge ruled in their favor.",
      "The Trump administration, the lawyers said, did not identify any harm that would stem from the commissioner's continued service during the time it will take for the Supreme Court to rule.",

      "It is unclear when the FBI will begin its transition out of the Hoover building.",
      "In a March speech at the Justice Department, President Trump said his administration is \"going to build another big FBI building right where it is, which would have been the right place, because the FBI and the DOJ have to be near each other.\"",
      "\"They were going to build an FBI headquarters three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that the state's political leadership had \"no bearing\" on his decision to cancel a previous Biden administration plan to move the headquarters to Maryland.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk is floating a new political party dubbed the \"America Party\" \u2014 but the idea could face major hurdles.",
    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. Musk raised the idea again this week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 and this time, Musk put a time limit on the plan.",
      "\"If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,\" Musk wrote in a post on X Monday evening, hours before the bill passed the Senate on Tuesday and headed back to the House. \"Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.\"",
      "It remains unclear if Musk will follow through on his pledge, but the idea could be easier said than done. If Musk decides to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures, and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money, but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

      "Last month, Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border recorded just over 6,000 apprehensions of migrants who entered the country without authorization, the lowest monthly tally ever reported by the agency, according to the preliminary Customs and Border Protection data. The previous monthly low reported by Border Patrol was in March, when the agency recorded around 7,200 migrant apprehensions.",
      "The numbers stand in stark contrast to the record levels of apprehensions made by Border Patrol under the Biden administration, which faced a humanitarian, political and operational crisis of unprecedented proportions at the southern border until it implemented restrictive asylum measures last year.",

During some months under the Biden administration, tens of thousands of migrants were released into the U.S. with instructions to show up in immigration court to plead their cases.",
      "\"We have never seen numbers this low. Never,\" Homan wrote on X.",
      "While Border Patrol has not publicly reported monthly apprehension data before fiscal year 2000, the last time the agency averaged close to 6,000 migrant interdictions per month over a year was in the late 1960s, historical figures indicate.",
      "Immediately after taking office in January, President Trump empowered border officials to swiftly deport migrants \u2014 without hearing their asylum claims \u2014 under an emergency proclamation he argued was needed to quell an \"invasion.\" That policy is being challenged in court by civil rights advocates, who argue it violates U.S. asylum law. Immigration authorities were also directed to halt all releases, absent life-threatening circumstances.",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border, tasking them with repelling illegal crossings through the construction of barriers. Along some parts of the border with Mexico, the U.S. military has set up zones where soldiers can temporarily detain migrants before transferring them to immigration officials.",
      "In the interior of the country, the Trump administration has tasked Immigration and Customs Enforcement with overseeing large-scale arrests of immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. Last week, the number of individuals held in ICE detention set a record high.",
      "Amid the historic lull in illegal crossings, hundreds of Border Patrol agents have been assigned to help ICE with immigration arrests away from the border, in places like Los Angeles.",
      "The administration has also staged an intense messaging campaign to compel immigrants in the U.S. illegally to self-deport. It has offered them carrots in the form of travel assistance through a government smartphone app and a $1,000 self-deportation bonus.",
      "But it has also threatened those who refuse to leave with arrest and forcible deportation, and even the possibility of ending up detained at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, a tent facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" or a maximum-security mega prison in El Salvador.",
      "Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown has not been without criticism. In communities across the U.S., especially Democratic-led cities, videos of masked federal agents arresting unauthorized immigrants at courthouses or outside homes have triggered outcry from local residents and politicians.",
      "Some Republicans have urged the Trump administration to prioritize the arrest of migrants with serious criminal records amid concerns that its crackdown is extending well beyond the dangerous individuals the president promised to expel. Recent figures show fewer than 10% of those booked in ICE detention in recent months were convicted of violent crimes.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday that Israel has agreed to a proposal for a two-month ceasefire in its war with Hamas.",
      "\"Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize the 60 Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not give any details on the proposed deal, and it's unclear whether Hamas will accept it. Neither Israel nor Hamas has commented publicly on the terms of a possible agreement.",
      "The president said Qatar and Egypt \u2014 who have previously helped mediate talks with Hamas \u2014 \"will deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next Monday. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects to discuss both Gaza and Iran, which struck a separate ceasefire deal with Israel last week after a 12-day campaign between the two countries that included U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump said a ceasefire could begin \"sometime next week.\"",
      "Prior pushes for a ceasefire have stalled. In late May, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire that would have required Hamas to release 10 living hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as the remains of another 18 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel would have released 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas said it responded with \"notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called Hamas' response \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "The war began when Hamas launched a terror attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with an intense air and ground offensive in the Palestinian territory, killing more than 56,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The two sides have agreed to two prior ceasefire and hostage release deals since the start of the 21-month conflict, the most recent of which ran from January to March.",
      "Since then, Netanyahu has said there is \"no way\" he will agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated, though he left the door open to cutting deals to release hostages.",
      "Israel said Tuesday it had \"expanded its operations to additional areas within the Gaza Strip, eliminating dozens of terrorists.\" Hamas' health ministry said Tuesday some 116 people had been killed across the territory over a 24-hour period.",
      "Separately, in recent weeks, the U.S. has financially supported a controversial new group to distribute food in the Gaza Strip, but the effort has faced frequent reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces near food distribution sites. The group, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has defended its efforts.",

      "But first GOP leaders will have to win over Republicans who are opposed to the changes the Senate made to the bill that the House passed in May. The Senate's steeper cuts to Medicaid are likely to irritate moderates while the higher price tag could alienate conservatives. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate bill would add $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We got more work to do, but it's going to get done,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters as Congress scrambles to meet a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to get the bill to Mr. Trump.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes that stretched more than 24 hours, delivering a major victory for the president and bringing the signature piece of legislation of his second term one step closer to his desk.",
      "The measure passed in a 51 to 50 vote, with all but three Republicans supporting the bill. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "The vote came after the Senate worked through the weekend and into a scheduled recess to pass the bill, which now returns to the House for sign-off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the measure, and pushed lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "The legislation's passage also marks a significant victory for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who worked to sway GOP holdouts to back the legislation amid opposition on multiple fronts that threatened to thwart the bill's progress in recent days.",
      "\"This was an incredible victory for the American people,\" Thune said after the vote.",
      "Known by the GOP as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would increase federal deficits by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "While some Republicans had taken issue with the legislation's impact on the deficit, others cited concern with some of the steep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO has said would leave nearly 12 million more Americans without health coverage over the coming years. And with a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders could only afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vance as a tie-breaker. But those concerns were not enough to defeat the legislation, and last-minute changes secured the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, while apparently quelling other possible opponents to the bill.",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed news of the vote during a trip to Florida. \"There is something for everyone [in the bill], and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, met with possible holdouts in his office as the vote series stretched late Monday and into the wee hours Tuesday. The majority leader met with fiscal hawks including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida, and at another point in the night, he met with Paul, who had pledged to oppose the bill over a provision raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Thune also talked briefly with Murkowski early Tuesday, since it appeared likely that her vote could make or break the bill in the Senate. The Alaska Republican had concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs and their impact on her state.",
      "Murkowski told reporters after the vote that her thought process on the bill was \"agonizing.\"",
      "\"I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" Murkowski said, citing the cuts to social safety net programs. But she outlined the unique conditions in her state, and the support Alaska received in the final version of the bill, saying \"I had to look on balance because people in my state are the ones that I put first.\"",
      "In a statement later in the afternoon, Murkowski said, \"My sincere hope is that this is not the final product.\"",
      "\"This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President's desk,\" she wrote. \"We need to work together to get this right.\"",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts, including the fiscal hawks, Murkowski and Collins.",
      "Paul and Tillis were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and they both voted against the legislation on final passage. With a handful of other possible opponents, Thune told reporters overnight that GOP leaders were working to determine what \"everybody has to have in terms of votes,\" a sign that the vote would come down to the wire.",
      "The Senate action comes after the House narrowly passed the bill last month. Senate Republicans worked to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed. The House could return to Washington as early as Wednesday to begin consideration of the revised bill.",
      "Senate Republicans passed the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP entered a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the July 4 deadline.",
      "Senate Democrats combated the legislation in one of the only ways available to them: by delaying the process. Democrats forced the bill to be read in its entirety over the weekend, totaling nearly 16 hours, before using debate time to rail against the bill, and proposing amendments to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "On Monday, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions, to no avail. As the votes stretched overnight Monday and into Tuesday, senators voted on a handful of notable amendments, including a near-unanimous vote to eliminate language from the bill that would have put a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The Senate also approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements preventing payments for people who are deceased.",
      "An amendment proposed by Collins that would have increased the rural hospital stabilization fund from $25 billion to $50 billion and imposed a higher tax rate on the wealthy to pay for the larger fund fell short. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that the amendment was like putting a \"band aid on an amputation \u2014 it doesn't fix the problem.\" The outcome made it less likely that Collins would ultimately support the bill, although the change was expected to be included in a wide-ranging amendment to the bill.",
      "During the marathon vote series, the Senate also addressed an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Though Democrats railed against the move as the \"nuclear option,\" the chamber voted along party lines to affirm the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "Schumer lambasted the bill after the vote, criticizing Republicans for bowing to the president.",
      "\"The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,\" Schumer said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",

    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Scientists have identified what could be the oldest rocks on Earth from a rock formation in Canada.",
      "The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt has long been known for its ancient rocks - plains of streaked gray stone on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Quebec. But researchers disagree on exactly how old they are.",
      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",
      "\"There's a lot of interest for these rocks, which we understand,\" said Palliser, a member of the community. \"We just don't want any more damage.\"",

      "Its precision allows the telescope to peer far into space, with galaxies tens of millions of light-years away from Earth among the subjects of the observatory's debut portraits of cosmos. Also pictured is the \"cotton candy\" nebula, which earned that nickname because of its bright pink and blue pattern.",
      "Officially, the swirling mass is called the Trifid Nebula, and it exists about 5,000 light-years from Earth, according to the Rubin Observatory. Nearby is the Lagoon Nebula, another colorful cloud, which is located about 4,000 light-years away and appears alongside Trifid in the observatory's latest images. Both are in the constellation Sagittarius, according to the Rubin Observatory.",
      "Zoomed-in views of the nebulae are seen in a video shared by the observatory, showcasing the Trifid and Lagoon formations at a scale never seen before. The composite image was created from more than 678 different exposures taken over a 7-hour period by the camera that powers the observatory's massive telescope.",
      "The telescope's long-term mission is set to begin later this year, when it will perform nightly scans of the sky for the next decade in an effort to learn more about the early universe and some of its properties that still are not well-understood, like dark energy.",

      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",

    "summary": "Husband Barry Morphew rearrested as authorities link him to animal tranquilizers found in wife Suzanne Morphew's bone marrow.",
    "story": [
      "Barry Morphew, a longtime suspect in his wife's disappearance and murder, was arrested in Arizona on June 20, 2025, two days after he was indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the case of his wife Suzanne Morphew's death. This was the second time Barry Morphew has been arrested and charged in her death. The initial charges were dismissed without prejudice, meaning authorities reserved the right to charge him again.",
      "The latest grand jury indictment alleges new details that are surprising even to those who've been following the case since Suzanne Morphew disappeared on Mother's Day, 2020. Barry Morphew has long stated he had nothing to do with his wife's murder, and the couple's two adult daughters have stood by their father.",
      "After the initial charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed, authorities continued to search for her body and on September 22, 2023, Suzanne Morphew's remains were found in and around a \"shallow, clandestine grave \u2026 less than an hour south of the Morphew residence,\" according to the indictment.",
      "\"The majority of her bones were recovered,\" the indictment states, and a board-certified anthropologist, a botanist, and an entomologist were brought in to analyze the remains and concluded that \"it was unlikely Suzanne decomposed from a fresh body to a skeleton at this location.\"",
      "Dan \"Dan R\" Ridenour, who lives in the Salida area of Colorado where the Morphews lived when Suzanne Morphew went missing, is the news director and operations manager of the Heart of the Rockies Radio. He told \"48 Hours\" that it was hard to make sense of the indictment's allegations against Barry Morphew. \"Why would he do that?\" Ridenour asked. \"Why would he move the body?\"",
      "For one thing, Ridenour noted that Barry Morphew has been under heavy scrutiny since Suzanne Morphew was reported missing. \"There is not a more recognizable face in Salida than Barry Morphew,\" Ridenour said. \"He's going to take that chance and drive 70 miles to the south and dig a shallow grave? There are too many questions.\"",
      "But the indictment is unequivocal: Suzanne Morphew's bones were moved to that location after her body had decomposed elsewhere, meaning it had to have been moved at least twice after her murder. \"She was not initially killed in the San Luis Valley,\" Ridenour said. \"She was moved there. That was not her first grave.\"",
      "In addition, tests revealed that in Suzanne Morphew's bone marrow, the chief toxicologist found a mixture of three chemicals known as BAM. The compound is used to tranquilize wildlife and, the indictment noted, that Barry Morphew has admitted using those drugs to tranquilize deer. He had even admitted to authorities that, one month before Suzanne Morphew disappeared, he had used those chemicals to tranquilize a deer near the breezeway of the Morphew residence.",
      "The chemical compound takes several minutes to cause \"sedation\" the indictment states and tests found \"that [Suzanne's] death was not immediate following BAM exposure because Suzanne Morphew's body had begun to metabolize the drug before she died.\"",
      "Authorities have long suspected that Barry Morphew chased Suzanne Morphew around their house after somehow injecting her with the BAM compound. According to texts, Suzanne Morphew had told Barry Morphew she wanted to divorce \"civilly\" and it was later revealed she was having a two-year affair with a former schoolmate.",
      "The indictment links Barry Morphew to purchases of the BAM compound which is a highly controlled drug. It concludes: \"The prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant updates the case in \"The Suzanne Morphew Case: Nothing is What It Seems,\" airing Saturday, July 5 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "\"This case is incredibly unique,\" says Aya Gruber, now a law professor at the University of Southern California School of Law. \"When you started to dig a little bit deeper, nothing is what it seems.\"",
      "Gruber studied thousands of pages of public documents from the prosecutor, investigators and defense attorneys.",
      "Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on May 10, 2020. She'd been alone that day because her daughters, Macy, 16, and Mallory, 20, were off on a church-sponsored camping trip and planned to return home later that Mother's Day.",
      "After Suzanne Morphew was officially reported missing by a neighbor, investigators began to examine Barry Morphew's story. Friends and relatives told investigators that the marriage was troubled, and agents found a deleted text from Suzanne to Barry on his phone that read: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "But 10 days after Suzanne Morphew disappeared, agents were pulled in a different direction when they found a so-called spy pen belonging to Suzanne. The spy pen has a long battery life and is designed to look and write like an ordinary pen.",
      "But it has one extra feature: it is voice-activated and records conversations. Suzanne Morphew had acquired it, she told a friend, because she suspected Barry Morphew was having an affair and she hoped to use the pen to gather evidence. But the plan backfired.",
      "Investigators listened to what the pen had recorded and, although there was no evidence of Barry Morphew having an affair, they say they heard \"intimate\" conversations between Suzanne Morphew and someone named Jeff.",
      "It was another twist in a case filled with them.",
      "Without knowing who Jeff was or his location when Suzanne Morphew went missing, they could not eliminate him as a person or interest. It took FBI agents six months before they uncovered his identity: Jeff Libler, a man both Suzanne and Barry Morphew knew from their Alexandria, Indiana, high school. Libler and Suzanne Morphew had had a one-time fling after graduation, and she'd reached out to him in 2018 after the Morphews moved to Colorado with a Facebook message that read simply: \"Howdy stranger.\"",
      "\"And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop,\" said Ashley Franco, a former reporter for\u00a0KKTV, the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, who has covered the story from the beginning.",
      "That was enough to ignite a nearly two-year love affair. Libler had a wife and six children. He lived in Michigan and claimed to be there with his family on the day Suzanne Morphew vanished.",
      "Agents eventually discovered the lovers had spoken to each other for dozens of hours, often communicating via secret accounts on WhatsApp and LinkedIn. Libler also admitted that they met for romantic rendezvous in New Orleans, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Indiana.",
      "After Suzanne Morphew disappeared in May 2020, Libler did not contact authorities. Instead, agents say, he deleted the accounts where he had communicated with Suzanne Morphew.",
      "\"What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne,\" said Gruber. \"He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.\"",
      "Libler reportedly told agents he did not want to tarnish Suzanne Morphew's memory, but he also told them he worried that he'd lose his wife, children and job. He also worried he might be considered a suspect. \"He asks the agents, 'Am I a target?'\" said Gruber.",
      "After agents confronted him, he did cooperate, providing a sample of his DNA and passwords to the deleted accounts. Investigators eventually were able to retrace the couple's steps and recovered texts by tapping into the iCloud accounts of Libler and Suzanne Morphew.",
      "Libler was able to provide receipts for a home goods store he'd visited in Michigan on the day Suzanne vanished and he was eventually cleared.",
      "Investigators still had their suspicions about Barry Morphew. They never uncovered any evidence that he was having an affair, but investigators found his actions on that Mother's Day weekend to be suspicious.",
      "They asked Barry Morphew why his phone seemed to be pinging all around his house on the day before Mother's Day and he told them he must have been out shooting chipmunks, which he said were a constant nuisance at the house.",
      "It was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi, but Barry Morphew stood by it, saying he'd shot 85 chipmunks in the two years he owned that Colorado house.",
      "\"And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him,\" said Gruber.",
      "Van Sant asked why. \"Because [agents are] saying, 'Well, you know, now he's admitting to having run around the house. And this is a ridiculous explanation, so it must be the explanation of a guilty person,'\" Gruber replied.",
      "What's more, there was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around the house and neighbors did not recall hearing any type of disturbance during that period of time.",
      "Cases sometimes turn on the smallest of things and, in this case, agents seized upon just such a small item.",
      "Agents had found a small clear plastic cap in the family's dryer that they believed was from a syringe used to inject chemicals into a tranquilizer dart. Barry Morphew acknowledged he knew how to inject chemicals into a dart and that he'd shot many deer for trophies and so he could get their antlers. His garage was filled with deer heads and a pile of antlers. However, there was no working tranquilizer gun found in the home and authorities say Barry's DNA was not on that plastic cap.",
      "Even so, investigators developed a theory that Barry Morphew had shot Suzanne Morphew with a tranquilizer gun and then chased her around the house before she passed out. They found a door frame that was broken and suspected there had been a confrontation.",
      "Agents also tapped into a new investigative tool called digital vehicle forensics.\u00a0They pulled data from his Ford truck's many computers and got the truck to \"talk\" to them. They learned that when Barry Morphew said he was sleeping, the truck's doors were opening and closing.",
      "He was\u00a0arrested and charged\u00a0with first-degree murder and other crimes in May 2021. Barry eventually pleaded not guilty.",

    "summary": "The House on Thursday passed the signature piece of legislation of President Trump's second term, approving his \"big, beautiful bill\" by a vote of 218 to 214.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed the signature piece of legislation of President Trump's second term, approving a massive bill that includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts while ramping up funding for defense and implementing the administration's immigration agenda.",
      "The lower chamber voted 218 to 214 to approve the measure, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania \u2014 joining all Democrats in opposing the bill. The Senate passed the legislation, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" earlier this week.",
      "President Trump plans to sign the bill at a ceremony at the White House on Friday, coinciding with the July 4 holiday.",
      "The vote came after a marathon overnight session that saw GOP leaders overcome internal opposition to advance the bill, paving the way for final passage. Most Republican members who balked at many of the changes the Senate made to the legislation eventually relented and voted to pass it.",
      "Once it became clear that GOP leaders had the votes they needed, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to delay the inevitable by speaking on the floor for 8 hours and 44 minutes, setting the record for the longest House speech in U.S. history. He called out Republicans for the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, highlighting the Americans who he said would suffer because of the bill.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation's passage after the vote, outlining the long path to passage since the bill was initially dreamt up more than a year ago, while saying it all came down to \"belief.\"",
      "\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do as a group. We believed in the election cycle last fall that we were going to be given this great blessing of unified government,\" Johnson said. \"And we did not want to waste that opportunity.\"",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance, due to the cuts to Medicaid and programs under the Affordable Care Act. It would also dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, a key priority for Republicans and the president.",
      "GOP opposition melts away",
      "The final vote came after House GOP leadership scrambled Wednesday and into the wee hours Thursday to shore up support for the measure ahead of a key procedural vote to approve the rules for debate on the floor.",
      "Although Johnson spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May, the Senate made a number of tweaks that irked House members on a number of fronts \u2014 from its cuts to Medicaid to its impact on the deficit. Johnson acknowledged that the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred,\" though he repeatedly urged that the final product was largely what the House had signed off on in May.",
      "The Senate-passed bill included steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction that irked many House members. Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House pressured House Republicans to vote for the bill.",
      "The vote on the key procedural hurdle began around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and didn't wrap up until about 3:20 a.m. Thursday. Five House Republicans initially voted no on the rule, which would have been enough to tank the vote. But GOP leaders kept the vote open as they worked to shore up support, allowing lawmakers to change from no to yes.",
      "Johnson told reporters that Mr. Trump was \"directly engaged\" with skeptical members to get them onboard.",
      "\"Members wanted to hear certain assurances from him about what's ahead, what the future will entail, and what we're going to do next, and all of that,\" Johnson said. \"And he was very, very helpful in that process.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure over Truth Social as a handful of Republican holdouts didn't appear to be budging, declaring: \"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\"",
      "\"What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote shortly after midnight.",
      "The House ultimately voted 219 to 213 to advance the bill in a key victory for Republican leaders, who won the support of about a dozen GOP opponents to the rule. And when the vote finally came to an end, Fitzpatrick was the sole Republican opposed. He would also vote against final passage.",
      "Johnson told reporters that the breakthrough came amid help from the president, along with lengthy listening sessions with the bill's opponents, \"making sure that their concerns were addressed.\"",
      "\"A lot of people had to take the time to thoroughly go through the Senate's changes to our bill and that's fine,\" Johnson said. \"That was necessary to get them to yes.\"",
      "Ultimately, only Massie and Fitzpatrick bucked GOP leaders to vote against the legislation. Massie, a conservative, had drawn the ire of the president due to his stance against the bill for weeks. He said in a statement after Thursday's vote that he voted against it \"because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said that the Senate's changes to the initial House legislation were too drastic for him to support.",
      "\"[I]t was the Senate's amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community,\" the Pennsylvania Republican said in a statement, referring to his district. \"The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard. I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\"",

    "summary": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for 8 hours and 44 minutes on Thursday, delaying final passage of Republicans' budget bill.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 There's no filibuster in the House, but Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway as the House debated President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" before it passed on Thursday.",
      "Jeffries held the House floor for more than eight hours, taking his \"sweet time\" with a marathon floor speech that delayed passage of Republicans' massive tax and spending cuts legislation and gave his minority party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an \"immoral\" bill.",
      "As Democratic leader, Jeffries can speak for as long as he wants during debate on legislation \u2014 hence its nickname on Capitol Hill, the \"magic minute,\" that lasts as long as leaders are speaking.",
      "He began the speech at 4:53 a.m. ET and finished at 1:37 p.m. ET, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, breaking the record set by then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California in 2021, when he was the GOP leader. McCarthy spoke for 8 hours, 32 minutes when he angrily criticized Democrats' \"Build Back Better\" legislation, breaking a record set by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, when she spoke about immigration for 8 hours, 7 minutes in 2018.",
      "\"I feel an obligation, Mr. Speaker, to stand on this House floor and take my sweet time,\" Jeffries said as he opened.",
      "The speech pushed a final vote on Mr. Trump's tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours. The New York Democrat used the time to criticize the bill's health care and food aid cuts, tax breaks for the wealthy and rollbacks to renewable energy programs, among other parts of the bill that Democrats decry.",
      "He also killed time by riffing on hip-hop, King George III and his own life story, among other diversions. He called out Republicans who have voiced concerns about the bill, read stories from people concerned about their health care from those GOP lawmakers' districts and praised his own members, some of whom sat behind him and cheered, clapped, laughed and joined hands.",
      "\"This reckless Republican budget is an immoral document, and that is why I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives with my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus to stand up and push back against it with everything we have,\" Jeffries said.",
      "He ended the speech in the cadence of a Sunday sermon, with most of the Democratic caucus in a tight huddle around him. One colleague called out, \"Bring it home, Hakeem!\"",
      "\"We don't work for President Donald Trump,\" Jeffries said, as a handful of Republicans across the aisle sat silent and occasionally snickered at the leader as he kept talking.",
      "He invoked the late John Lewis, a civil rights activist in the 1960s and longtime Democratic congressman from Georgia. \"Get into good trouble, necessary trouble,\" Jeffries said. \"We're going to press on until victory is won.\"",
      "Jeffries sneaked small bites of food and drank liquids to boost his energy, but did not leave the chamber or his podium. The speech would be over if he did.",
      "Democrats were powerless to stop the huge bill, which Republicans passed by using an obscure budget procedure that bypasses the Senate filibuster. So they were using the powers they did have, mostly to delay. In the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forced Senate clerks to read the bill for almost 16 hours over the weekend.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey similarly gained attention in April when he spoke for more than 25 hours on the Senate floor about the first months of Mr. Trump's presidency and broke the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history. Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, but Jeffries' \"magic minute\" did not allow for any interaction with other members.",
      "Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty. When the speech was over, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri, called it \"a bunch of hogwash.\"",
      "The speech \"will not change the outcome that you will see very shortly,\" Smith said.",
      "After the bill passed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Democrats \"wanted to speak for hours and hours and break records because they wanted to stand in the way of history.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 15:58:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The latest grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew alleges new details that are surprising even to those who've been following the case since his wife Suzanne Morphew disappeared on Mother's Day 2020.",
    "story": [
      "This story previously aired on July 1, 2023. It was updated on July 3, 2025.",
      "Barry Morphew, a longtime suspect in his wife's Suzanne Morphew's disappearance, has been arrested a second time and charged with her murder after a toxicologist found a unique combination of tranquilizer drugs in her bone marrow, according to a grand jury indictment made public in June 2025.",
      "Morphew has in the past acknowledged using those tranquilizer drugs to knock out deer and cut off their antlers, authorities say.",
      "Barry Morphew was first arrested and charged with Suzanne's murder in 2021, but those charges were dismissed without prejudice, meaning authorities reserved the right to charge Morphew again. He has always maintained his innocence.",
      "When the initial charges were dismissed in April 2022, prosecutors claimed they were close to discovering Suzanne's remains. And on Sept. 22, 2023, agents with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation located her bones in a \"shallow, clandestine grave \u2026 less than an hour from the Morphew residence\" just outside Salida, Colorado, according to the most recent grand jury indictment.",
      "According to an autopsy report, the coroner's office in El Paso County, Colorado,\u00a0declared that Suzanne's death was: \"Homicide by unspecified means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication.\"",
      "Those three drugs make up a compound known informally as BAM to hunters who use it to sedate wildlife. The new indictment states that BAM was found in Suzanne's bone marrow. Barry Morphew was known to be an avid deer hunter whose home was filled with deer heads and antlers.",
      "The indictment links Barry Morphew to purchases of the BAM compound which is a highly controlled drug. It concludes: \"The prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew.\"",
      "In another twist, the indictment noted that Suzanne had not died immediately after being given the drugs. The autopsy revealed that her body had metabolized the BAM. Forensics experts determined she had not decomposed where her bones were found, meaning her remains had to have been moved at least twice.",
      "\"That was not her first grave,\" said Dan \"Dan R\" Ridenour, news director and operations manager at Heart of the Rockies Radio in Salida, CO. He also said he could not fathom why Barry would move Suzanne's body. \"There is not a more recognizable face in Salida than Barry Morphew,\" Ridenour said. \"He's going to take that chance and drive 70 miles to the south and dig a shallow grave? There are too many questions.\"",
      "The indictment does not answer those questions. Barry was arrested in Arizona but waived extradition to Colorado where he will be held on a $3 million cash bond. There is not yet a date for his homicide trial.",
      "When Suzanne first went missing back in 2020, investigators compiled and followed several bizarre clues\u2014a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen\u2014but lacked direct evidence.",
      "Investigators noticed Barry Morphew's cellphone appeared to be pinging all around his house on Mother's Day weekend 2020, which he maintains was because he was chasing and shooting at chipmunks. Investigators also found a plastic cap for a syringe that they believe was used to load a tranquilizer dart in the couple's dryer. Barry Morphew, investigators say, told them he didn't know how the cap got there, but admitted he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. The cap, however, did not contain any of Barry's DNA.",
      "Investigators also found a spy pen right out of a James Bond movie that was able to capture and record conversations. The pen captured several intimate conversations between Suzanne and a secret lover. Investigators also uncovered DNA on the glovebox of Suzanne's Range Rover, which traced back to an unknown male connected to three sexual assaults.",
      "This past week, a prosecutor working on the case of Suzanne Morphew, a missing mother of two, said in open court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body. \"She is in a very difficult spot,\" said Deputy District Attorney Mark Hurlbert. \"We actually have more than just a feeling \u2026 and the sheriff's office is continuing to look for Mrs. Morphew's body.\"",
      "It was a major update in the Morphew case which began on Mother's Day 2020, when she disappeared from her Colorado home. Hurlbert said there was no timetable for bringing a murder case to trial. \"That could be a long time. It could be quick, it could be long. It depends on a lot of our investigation,\" he said.",

      "MISSING ON MOTHER'S DAY",
      "Dan Ridenour [riding in car with Peter Van Sant]: What happened on this road is a real mystery. No one knows. Where is Suzanne?",
      "In the days, weeks and months after Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020, her trail went cold, but the mother of two's disappearance had become the biggest story in Colorado.",
      "ANDREW MOORMAN [talking to searchers, CBS Denver news report]:\u00a0We're gonna fan out and were gonna work that area very carefully, OK?",
      "Four months in, Suzanne's brother, Andrew Moorman, organized a citizen's search. He said he felt he had to do something \u2014 anything.",
      "ANDREW MOORMAN [to CBS Denver]: I hope to find her alive and at some point, you have to realize when somebody's been missing after so long, that the chances of that diminish dramatically.",
      "The thought that Suzanne may have been abducted hit the peaceful, picturesque town of Salida hard.",
      "Dan Ridenour: I came home every day and my wife asked me, \"had they found her yet?\"",
      "Dan Ridenour has covered the story for his local morning show.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry and Suzanne Morphew were not known well in Salida, Colorado \u2026They had only been here for a couple of years.",
      "Before moving to Colorado in 2018, Barry and Suzanne grew up in the small town of Alexandria, Indiana, where they met in high school. Suzanne competed for homecoming queen. Barry was a star baseball player who was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays. Injury ended Barry's dreams of a major league career. They both attended Purdue University and married in 1994. He started a landscaping business. Suzanne taught middle school before becoming a full-time mother.",
      "Dan Ridenour: They had a couple of daughters \u2026 one in college \u2026 And they had a daughter in high school \u2026",
      "Macy, 16 years old when her mom disappeared, lived at home. Her sister Mallory attended college and the Morphews told some friends they moved to a home just outside of Salida to be closer to their older daughter. But there were also rumblings about the state of the Morphew's marriage.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Maybe a new place, a new \u2014 home, new scenery around them \u2026 would strengthen their family and therefore strengthen their marriage.",
      "But the move did not appear to improve the relationship. It was a tough time, says her sister Melinda Moorman.",
      "Melinda Moorman: My sister had sent me a text message \u2026 It was very lengthy. It was very powerful. It was very revealing.",
      "In a Zoom interview, Melinda said she received Suzanne's text two days before she disappeared, and it was boiling over with anger toward Barry.",
      "The text read in part: \"He's also been abusive emotionally and physically\u2026 I feel more angry now. Anger at what I've allowed.\"",
      "Melinda Moorman: Barry was very dominant in the relationship, and my sister was a very passive, gentle soul \u2026 he had \u2026 a great tendency to overpower, intimidate people to get what he wanted.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what kinda boss was he?",
      "Cody Cox: You know, he was real quiet \u2026 stern \u2026 He knew what he was doin', 'cause that's what he did in Indiana.",
      "Cody Cox was part of Barry's landscaping crew for nearly two years when Barry first arrived in Colorado.",
      "Cody Cox: I talked pretty highly about Barry 'cause I was with him all the time. And he's like, an inspiration to me almost \u2026 he was a real cool guy.",
      "Cody said he regularly heard Barry talking to Suzanne as they drove in Barry's truck.",
      "Cody Cox: : \u2026 they seemed to communicate pretty well. Like I said, I could hear almost every phone call he had.",
      "And he says he met Suzanne a handful of times; she even made cookies for his wife and kids.",
      "Cody Cox: She was a sweetheart. She was a real kind lady \u2026 She's almost like an angel, like somethin' you'd see off a Hallmark movie, you know \u2026 real nice, almost too perfect.",
      "Cody Cox: So, when I heard about the news, I didn't believe it \u2026 I heard it actually on the radio. And I was like, \"Did they just say Suzanne?\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh. Who'd even wanna hurt her?\"",
      "The first day authorities searched for Suzanne, they found her mountain bike close to the Morphew home.",
      "Peter Van Sant [at ravine]: Where was the mountain bike found?",
      "Dan Ridenour [pointing]: It was found right over this little cliff right here resting on these boulders.",
      "Dan Ridenour: She was new at mountain biking. So, an accident is certainly plausible. I would only ask, \"Where's Suzanne?\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: She would have been injured, yeah?",
      "Dan Ridenour: She would have been injured.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Was there clothing found down here?",
      "Dan Ridenour: No.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Was her helmet found down here?",
      "Dan Ridenour: No.",
      "Investigators believe the scene was staged and, days later, they discovered Suzanne's helmet roughly a mile away off Highway 50.",
      "Dan Ridenour [riding in car]: The helmet was found on the south side of the road.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, this side of the road?",
      "Dan Ridenour: Which would be to our left.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, is the thought somebody threw it out of a window, perhaps?",
      "Dan Ridenour: That's the thinking, yes \u2026",
      "It appeared as though Suzanne could have been abducted, and that's when Barry made a videotaped public plea on social media. In those early days, Barry had a theory about what happened to Suzanne that he shared with Tyson Draper who has his own YouTube channel.",
      "BARRY MORPHEW: Where are you from?",
      "TYSON DRAPER: I'm from Arizona.",
      "BARRY MORPHEW: OK.",
      "BARRY MORPHEW: Let me tell you what happened.",
      "TYSON DRAPER: OK.",
      "They happened to meet at the site where Suzanne's mountain bike was found and Tyson secretly videotaped Barry:",
      "BARRY MORPHEW [to Draper]: The first night there was a mountain lion that officers seen that walked by the car. So, we thought that maybe she got attacked by a lion.",
      "A mountain lion killed her?",
      "Dan Ridenour: If that happened, there would have been signs of that \u2026 There would've been blood, there would've been a struggle \u2026 So, that was a very short-lived speculation.",
      "Authorities began to doubt that Suzanne even took a bike ride, especially after her sunglasses and hydration backpack were found in her car.\u00a0 Investigators also found her driver's license and credit cards in her Range Rover. But her cell phone was missing.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did Barry Morphew cooperate with investigators during the course of this?",
      "Ashley Franco: He had been interviewed by investigators through the course of it and he talked to investigators almost every time.",
      "Ashley Franco, who reported on the case for the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, KKTV, has read the police documents and she says Barry has repeatedly told the same story. He came home around 3 p.m. on May 9, 2020 and had a pleasant evening with Suzanne. The next morning, Mother's Day, Barry says he drove to a job some 3 hours away.",
      "Ashley Franco: He says the last time he sees his wife is when she's sleeping in their bed.",
      "As investigators began trying to verify Barry's alibi, they were pulled in a new direction. Suzanne's spy pen had surfaced with that intimate conversation. Now they needed to figure out the identity of \"Jeff,\" Suzanne's lover.",
      "Ashley Franco: Could this man have had something to do with Suzanne's disappearance?",
      "SUZANNE'S SECRET LOVER IDENTIFIED",
      "It was just days after Suzanne Morphew went missing when investigators make that intriguing discovery.",

      "Peter Van Sant: A spy pen.",
      "Aya Gruber is a law professor and a former defense attorney.\u00a0 She has closely studied all the public investigative files in the Morphew case; she knows it was not easy for investigators to find Suzanne's secret lover: a man named \"Jeff.\"",
      "Aya Gruber: She hid that affair so well that it took \u2026 agents six months to find the man she was having an affair with.",
      "\"Jeff\" turned out to be Jeff Libler and he had a wife and six children in Michigan where he lived. He and Suzanne had a one-time fling after high school. Decades passed until Suzanne reached out to Jeff, out of the blue, in 2018.",
      "Ashley Franco: When Suzanne and Barry moved to Colorado, Suzanne messaged him on Facebook.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what did she message him?",
      "Ashley Franco: \"Howdy Stranger.\" \u2026 And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop.",
      "In the months after Suzanne went missing, Jeff kept quiet.\u00a0 He only began cooperating after he was located by investigators, who learned Jeff had taken steps to hide the nearly two-year affair.",
      "Aya Gruber: What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne. \u2026 He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.",
      "Jeff told agents he only took those steps because he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory and worried he might lose his family and job. He was also worried agents considered him a suspect.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 he asks the agents, \"Am I a target?\"",
      "Although he did not come forward on his own, Jeff did assist agents after they found him. He agreed to provide access to his DNA, phone records and his passwords for those deleted accounts. By looking through the couple's iCloud accounts and phone records, agents were able to piece together their relationship, including the times they met in person.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators also found that Suzanne, on several instances, had gone on vacation to meet up with Jeff in many different states, ranging from Louisiana to Florida.",
      "Investigators also discovered they'd sent intimate photos to each other, talked of becoming husband and wife, and even mentioned leaving the United States.",
      "Ashley Franco: Jeff and Suzanne had talked about moving away \u2026 moving to Ecuador at one point \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: If you were an investigator instead of a law professor, what would you wanna know about this Jeff Libler?",
      "Aya Gruber: Everything. I'd wanna know everything about what he was doing, what he was thinking. \u2026 Here is somebody who arguably had the last communication \u2026 with Suzanne before she went missing.",
      "The love affair between Suzanne and Jeff became a key part of the investigation as agents tried to figure out what happened to her on that Saturday, May 9, the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Records show that Suzanne and Jeff messaged each other 59 times that day, much more than usual, authorities say.",
      "At one point, Suzanne sends Jeff a selfie. Investigators dub it her last \"proof of life\" photo. Barry was not home, as the lovers' texts heat up:",
      "At 2:05 p.m., Suzanne writes: \"I'm just in love with you. Whatcha up to?\"",
      "Jeff's response at 2:06 p.m. was: \"Want to strip down and get naked? LOL??\"",
      "She responds by saying she'll \"load up\" her WhatsApp account and then at 2:11 p.m., Suzanne writes, \"Okay I'm on WA\".",
      "Then, at 2:26 p.m., Suzanne gets a text from Barry that he's heading home. \"Done headed back.\"",
      "No one knows if Suzanne saw that text or was preoccupied with Jeff, but she does not answer.",
      "Barry follows up, appearing to wonder where Suzanne is. \"Did you leave?\"",
      "There was still no response from Suzanne and investigators speculate the next few moments are when Barry returned home. They notice that Barry's cell phone appears to be pinging all around the outside of his house. Was he chasing Suzanne before a final and fatal confrontation?",
      "Investigators asked Barry to explain that unusual phone activity.",
      "Aya Gruber: And he says, \"Well, lemme think about that. I was probably walking around my house shooting chipmunks.\"",
      "You heard right \u2014 it was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi.\u00a0 Barry says the chipmunks were a constant nuisance at his house and he'd been running around shooting them that day.",
      "Aya Gruber: And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him.",
      "There was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around Barry's house. Part of his problem, Aya says, is that Barry granted between 30 and 40 interviews \u2014 all without a lawyer \u2014 to everyone from a county detective to members of the FBI.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Would you have allowed him to do all these interviews?",
      "Aya Gruber: No. Absolutely not.",
      "Meanwhile, Jeff Libler was cleared. He told agents he was in Michigan that weekend and his alibi checked out. When investigators tell Barry of the affair, he denies knowing anything about it.",
      "But if Barry knew nothing about Suzanne's affair, what motive would he have to kill her? One clue may be a deleted text that investigators found on Barry's phone sent by Suzanne just days before: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "Dan Ridenour: So, the only thing that makes sense is that Barry Morphew lost it when Suzanne finally said, \"I'm leaving you.\"",
      "Barry knew that his daughters would be away on their camping trip that Saturday afternoon and authorities say he took advantage of that opportunity to kill Suzanne and clean up the crime scene.",
      "Peter Van Sant: From 2:47 p.m. until 10:17 p.m., just under 8 hours, Barry's phone goes into airplane mode. What do authorities believe happened during that time?",
      "Ashley Franco: Authorities say that they believe, when his phone went into airplane mode, that he was disposing of possible evidence.",
      "Unable to track Barry's cell phone, investigators tapped into a relatively new investigative technique \u2014 digital vehicle forensics \u2014 to pull a stream of data out of Barry's Ford truck. And Barry's truck told a different story than what he was telling investigators.",
      "Ashley Franco: They were using Barry's own car against him.",
      "IF A TRUCK COULD TALK \u2014  \u00a0IN THIS CASE, IT DID",
      "Ben LeMere is an expert in the new field of vehicle forensics.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Give me a sense of how your technology, from your company, helps solve criminal cases.",
      "Ben LeMere: So, a lotta times it's used to \u2026 locate bodies.",
      "LeMere is the CEO of the Berla Corporation.",
      "Ben LeMere: It helps \u2026 get people convicted. It's helped get people not convicted.",
      "Investigators from Scotland Yard to the FBI have learned how to use Berla's software to tap into the dozens of computers in a car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's accurate enough to be used as evidence in court cases, correct?",
      "Ben LeMere: Yes, sir.",
      "Cases like the disappearance of Suzanne Morphew. Investigators created a Berla report, meaning they tapped into the data in Barry's Ford truck to track its movements after his cell phone went into airplane mode.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 a couple of the pieces of evidence that I think are very harmful to his case \u2014 come from the data in the car \u2026",
      "Ashley Franco: The prosecution's case is that Barry snapped at one point the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Authorities believe Barry killed Suzanne that afternoon. He told agents he went to bed around 8 p.m. that night, but the data pulled from the truck shows that the truck was put in reverse and moved some 96 feet closer to his house around 9:30 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators think that's when he could have loaded Suzanne's body.",
      "Initially, Barry told police that he set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. on Mother's Day and left the house by 5 a.m. to drive to a job site in Broomfield, a town near Denver, 150 miles from Salida. But the truck's computers show that someone was opening and closing the truck's doors around 3:30 a.m.",
      "Investigators believe Barry began driving toward Broomfield much earlier than he claimed, but there is a 4-hour window\u2014approximately 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.\u2014when no activity was recorded by the vehicle's computers.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 there are events in the car \u2014 that aren't recorded. So, they can't give sort of a full chronological picture.",
      "And if Barry hid Suzanne's body during that 4-hour window, the truck's data does not provide answers.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Why is data missing sometimes?",
      "Ben Lemere: Well, it gets overwritten. You know, it is a computer \u2026 Log files, they only last so long.",
      "But Barry helped fill in some of the missing data. He told agents he took a left upon leaving his home instead of a right because, even though it was dark, he remembered seeing some elk.",
      "Ashley Franco: He saw a herd of elk, and he's a hunter. So, he was interested, and he wanted to get an up-close look.",
      "That admission was significant to agents because it put him in an area where a key piece of evidence had been recovered.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators found Suzanne's bike helmet up that road. So, they believe, at that point when he turned left instead of turning right, that he could have been ditching her bike helmet.",
      "At 8:10 a.m. on Mother's Day morning, the truck's computers again begin recording data. And by then, Barry's cell phone had also come back to life. Agents are able to track Barry's cell and truck movements and can see that he first pulled over at a Broomfield bus stop where he discarded something in a garbage can.",
      "Ashley Franco: And then he moves on to a hotel trash can, a McDonald's trash can \u2026 a dumpster \u2026 in a Men's Wearhouse parking lot, and then back to the hotel, and dumps stuff in a dumpster there. Investigators believe that during these \"trash runs,\" he was disposing of evidence in different places within the Denver area.",
      "In a surveillance shot of Barry on one of those trash runs, investigators could not see what he was throwing away. It may have looked incriminating, but Barry claims it was just another day at the office. He told agents he was merely being cheap, not criminal.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And his claim, well, I just always have a lotta junk in \u2014 in the vehicle. I don't like to pay to have it \u2014 disposed at a landfill, I \u2014 this is just what I do.",
      "Ashley Franco: But it's suspicious that you would go to five different trash areas to dispose of several things. Why not just do it at one?",
      "After checking out the work site, Barry headed back to his room at the Holiday Inn, and investigators say he stayed there from 12:42 p.m. to 6:03 p.m. By then, he'd already spoken to older daughter Mallory who told him she could not get in touch with her mother.",
      "That's when the Morphew neighbors were contacted and could find no sign of Suzanne.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry asked them at that time if the bike was there, to go check on her \u2026 her bicycle is not here.",
      "Barry asks his neighbor to call 911.",
      "Dan Ridenour: And that's when the call to 911 \u2026 was placed, that Suzanne is missing.",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry doesn't head home immediately, and he is dropping some tools off for his coworkers.",
      "Tools including a shovel. With Suzanne now officially reported missing, Barry tells his workers there's a family emergency and arranges hotel rooms with one of those workers taking over Barry's room.",
      "Ashley Franco: When the employee was interviewed, he told investigators that \u2026 the room that Barry checked out of, it had a strong smell of chlorine or bleach.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Which suggests what?",
      "Ashley Franco: That he could be cleaning up a crime scene.",
      "Just after 6 p.m., Barry starts driving back to Salida. On the way, Barry speaks to sheriff deputies who advise him they've found Suzanne's bike and he arrives at that ravine at around 8:40 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: And investigators say that when he arrived there, he was pretty emotional for a few minutes.",
      "By Sunday night, Suzanne's daughters were back home but Suzanne is nowhere to be found. Barry offered a $100,000 reward for information that was later doubled to $200,000.",
      "Investigators later discovered many texts from Suzanne to a close friend that apparently revealed her tormented feelings about Barry:",
      "\"He won't speak of divorce \u2026\"",
      "\"I feel no peace when he's here \u2026\"",
      "\"I wouldn't feel safe alone with him \u2026\"",
      "Barry became the prime suspect and investigators think they know how he killed Suzanne.",
      "DID BARRY TARGET SUZANNE?",
      "While investigators searched the Morphew home and the family's cars and trucks, Barry continued to talk, seemingly to anyone with a badge. Weeks and months went by and Barry remained at the center of the investigation.",
      "Aya\u00a0Gruber: \u2026 police are absolutely correct as a statistical matter to look at intimate partners \u2026 when they suspect that a woman might've been harmed or murdered.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's something like eight out of 10 times, when a spouse dies the other one's involved.",
      "Aya Gruber: Absolutely.",
      "Sometimes the smallest item will turn an investigation, and, in this case, agents seized on a clear plastic cap that a forensics team had found in the family's dryer. Prosecutors believe the cap was from a syringe used to fill a tranquilizer dart.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How do prosecutors interpret that?",
      "Aya Gruber: The prosecution's theory is that at some point, when Barry came home on the 9th and snapped, and decided to murder Suzanne, he used a tranquilizer dart that you would use on animals \u2026",
      "There was no working tranquilizer rifle found in the Morphew's home. But Barry told investigators he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. He knew how to load darts with paralyzing chemicals, having used them to illegally sedate deer and remove their antlers to sell.",
      "We asked Dan Ridenour to read some of what Barry told investigators.",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: Barry said, \"The first thing I thought of when I came here and saw deer in my yard with big horns, I'm like, 'I'm getting them horns.'\"",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: \"And I'll tell you exactly what I did \u2026 I shoot 'em. They go to sleep, I cut their horns off \u2026 It's totally illegal \u2026 But you're gonna find tranq darts around my property because I've done that.\"",
      "Experts say it can take between 4 and 20 minutes for an animal the size of a deer to drop after being shot with a tranquilizer dart. Agents theorized that Barry's phone had pinged from various locations around the house\u2014not because he was shooting chipmunks, but because he was chasing Suzanne after he shot her.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators find a doorframe within the Morphew home that has been broken. And they say that there could have been a chase and then a struggle.",
      "Andrew Katers, the owner and CEO of Animal Care and Equipment Services, showed us a tranquilizer rifle he'd typically use on animals.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what are you holding?",
      "Andrew Katers: What I'm holding is a TeleDart model 706 rifle \u2026 they use this a lot in parks throughout the country.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And this does not fire bullets or shot?",
      "Andrew Katers: It only fires darts. \u2026 It's impossible to \u2014 get it to do anything else.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Could you now demonstrate for me?",
      "Andrew Katers: Sure. [fires rifle]",
      "Peter\u00a0Van Sant: So, if Suzanne had been struck by one of these darts \u2026 would she have time to run around, try to escape?",
      "Andrew Katers: She could. But I don't think she would get very far.",
      "Peter Van Sant: For a human being, it could be lethal.",
      "Andrew Katers: For sure.",
      "Bolstering the theory that Barry and Suzanne had a confrontation the day she disappeared were apparent scratches seen on Barry's left arm. Agents took the circumstantial evidence they gathered \u2014 Barry's apparently suspicious behavior, his contradictory statements, the puzzling data from his truck, Suzanne's disturbing texts and those five trash runs \u2014 and brought it all to the district attorney.",
      "On nearly the anniversary of Suzanne's disappearance, Barry is arrested in May 2021.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Tonight, the husband of Suzanne Morphew is behind bars accused of killing her. \u2026 The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office says that Barry Morphew was arrested this morning.",
      "Despite the lack of a body, Barry was charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence, and a variety of other allegations. He was held without bail and eventually pleaded not guilty.",
      "In their arrest affidavit, prosecutors spelled out what they believe happened to Suzanne:",
      "\"It had become clear that Barry could not control Suzanne's insistence on leaving him and he resorted to something he has done his entire life \u2014 hunt and control Suzanne like he had hunted and controlled animals.\"",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda reacted to the news of Barry's arrest.",
      "Melinda Moorman: There are no winners in this story. There are two families who are suffering deeply.",
      "Barry ultimately hired high-profile lawyers from Denver, and, in the summer of 2021, Judge Patrick Murphy heard the prosecution's evidence in open court.",
      "Ashley Franco: He decided to hold a preliminary hearing to see if this case had enough evidence to go to trial.",
      "The defense tried mightily to blunt the state's case, countering that the clear, plastic cap found in the dryer means nothing because no one could say how long it had been there. Furthermore, Suzanne's DNA was found on the cap, not Barry's. And as for that chlorine smell in Barry's hotel room \u2026",
      "Aya Gruber: One of the managers from the Holiday Inn had actually communicated to agents that this smell of chlorine existed before Barry Morphew was there \u2026 because that room's directly above an indoor pool.",
      "And there was one more crucial issue the prosecution had to deal with \u2014 one that its own forensic team uncovered. DNA evidence made public for the first time now threatened to destroy the case against Barry.",
      "Aya Gruber: This DNA discovery is so significant. The agents swab the inside of Suzanne Morphew's car and they found male DNA on the glove box, and it wasn't Barry Morphew's DNA. He was eliminated.",
      "The DNA also did not match Suzanne's lover Jeff Libler. But it did partially match the DNA of an unknown male who had attacked other women and it raised a disturbing question: had Suzanne fallen into the hands of a sexual predator?",
      "DA: AUTHORITIES ARE \"CLOSE\" TO FINDING SUZANNE'S BODY",
      "In September 2021 at the Chaffee County Courthouse in Salida, Judge Patrick Murphy heard arguments about whether there was enough evidence to try Barry Morphew for murder.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge named off three different scenarios, saying, \"Suzanne Morphew left willingly, Barry Morphew could have killed his wife, or someone else abducted Suzanne and killed her.\"",
      "He said it was \"unlikely\" Suzanne had run off on her own, even though she and lover Jeff Libler had discussed moving to Ecuador.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge says that because of the evidence that's \u2026 been presented about how loving Suzanne was toward her daughters and toward her family \u2026 that she could never do that.\"",
      "But the abduction theory could not be so easily dismissed \u2014 especially after that mysterious DNA was found in Suzanne's Range Rover. Investigators learned that DNA at least partially matched the profile of an unnamed man connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in Tempe, Phoenix and Chicago.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So how can that DNA end up in her car?",
      "Aya Gruber: Well, that DNA can end up in her car if she was the victim, for example, of a serial killer \u2026 or if the person was hired or opportunistic \u2026 There could also be potentially an innocent explanation that at some point, you know, the person came in contact with the car randomly as a mechanic \u2026 but it is very, very curious.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Barry Morphew can stand up and say, \"I'm not your killer. The man whose DNA is in my wife's car, tied to past sexual assaults, that's your killer.\"",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew absolutely could say that. And that's what his defense is banking on in this case.",
      "In frank language, Judge Murphy gave his opinion of the state's evidence: \"I find that the proof is not evident nor is the presumption great that Mr. Morphew committed first-degree murder.\"",
      "Despite that, the judge ruled there was probable cause to go to trial.",
      "Aya Gruber: But this judge was very careful to say, \"Look, I'm finding probable cause here, but it's only because I am looking at all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"",
      "Murphy said he was \"obligated\" to set bond for Barry.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge sets $500,000 cash-only bond.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And are they monitoring him in some fashion?",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew is wearing an ankle monitor for them to track him, to make sure that he is staying in Chaffee County.",
      "A few days later on September 20, 2021, Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy are all smiles as they leave the jail. They stand firmly behind their dad. Barry declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview.",
      "Barry Morphew's homicide trial was to begin on April 28, 2022, but in the months leading up to that date Judge Murphy recused himself and and was replaced by Judge Ramsey Lama.. And Barry's defense team, led by attorney Iris Eytan, filed motions asking that prosecutors be sanctioned for \"failing to produce discovery in a timely manner\" including some potentially exculpatory evidence \u2014  like the male DNA found in Suzanne's Range Rover.",
      "Iris Eytan: There's DNA that is placed on all the critical items of evidence in this case \u2014 on the bike, on the bike helmet, in the house, in the car \u2014   that is linked to unknown males.",
      "In April 2022, Judge Lama ruled that prosecutors repeatedly had missed deadlines and had failed to turn over important information in the discovery phase. The judge wrote that while he did not find those actions \"willful \u2026 the court does find this pattern to be negligent, bordering on, reckless.\" The judge's penalty was to knock out 14 prosecution witnesses \u2014 including experts in DNA and cell phone and vehicle data recovery. They would not, he said, be allowed to testify.",
      "Law professor Aya Gruber said the case was going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors even before she heard about the most recent sanctions.",
      "Aya Gruber: This case is incredibly unique. There are not many \u2026 murder cases \u2014   where the defendant has been charged with first-degree murder, where there is no body, no blood evidence of any foul play, no eyewitnesses.",
      "On April 19, 2022, as a pre-trial hearing was about to begin, District Attorney Linda Stanley filed a motion to dismiss the murder charges against Barry Morphew without prejudice, meaning the case could be refiled at a later date. In her motion, the DA pointed to the court's decision to bar \"several key witnesses \u2026 without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"",
      "Neither Barry, his daughters nor his lawyer had any advance warning.",
      "Iris Eytan: I didn't know a dismissal was coming today, although the writing was on the wall \u2026",
      "In her motion for dismissal, Stanley told the judge that officials believe they are close to discovering the location of Suzanne Morphew's body. Court papers specifically mentioned \"a remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence\" that will be excavated after five feet of snow melts.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Where is Suzanne Morphew's body? That is the million-dollar question.",
      "Remember, there was an approximate four-hour gap not recorded by the computers in Barry's truck on Mother's Day morning 2020. Whether investigators ultimately were able to recover some of that missing data or received a tip about the location of Suzanne's remains is not known.",
      "Dan Ridenour: The San Isabel National Forest, again, is 1.1 million acres. There's plenty of places to dispose of \u2014  of a body.",
      "Defense attorney Eytan denies Barry has any involvement in his wife's disappearance.",
      "Iris Eytan: Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew.\u00a0 He loves her and he misses her, and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.",
      "After the judge granted the motion to dismiss homicide charges against Barry, he walked out of court a free man, flanked as usual by his loyal daughters.",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda says she agrees with the request to dismiss charges against Barry at this point. She said she hoped that, with more time, searchers will find Suzanne's body and win \"a solid conviction in her murder. This would dispel all rumors of her whereabouts.\"",
      "And whatever else happens with the case, Melinda says she hopes her nieces keep one thing in mind.",
      "Melinda Moorman: \"Mallory, Macy \u2026 Your mother would have laid down her life for you girls \u2026 She would never leave you. She would never forsake you. She loved you with her whole being.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's remains were found in 2023 in a shallow grave about 40 miles south of their home.",
      "The coroner ruled Suzanne's death a homicide. A combination of drugs commonly used to tranquilize wildlife was found in her bone marrow.",
      "Barry Morphew was rearrested in June 2025 and charged with first-degree murder.\u00a0 He is being held on $3 million cash-only bail. He maintains his innocence.",

    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have arrested Mexican boxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. over alleged cartel ties, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. He is \"being processed for expedited removal from the United States,\" DHS said on social media.",
      "He was arrested Wednesday in Studio City, California, the department said. Ch\u00e1vez, who\u00a0recently lost a match\u00a0to influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul, is a Mexican citizen and a former WBC middleweight world champion.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for his alleged involvement in organized crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition and explosives, DHS said in a news release. Ch\u00e1vez",
      "is also allegedly believed to be an affiliate of the Sinaloa cartel, which the Trump administration designated a foreign terror organization in January, DHS said.",
      "On June 27, authorities determined that Ch\u00e1vez had made fraudulent statements on a lawful permanent resident application, and was in the country illegally and could be removed. His arrest comes amid the Trump administration's\u00a0crackdown on immigration, including a lawsuit against Los Angeles' \"sanctuary city\" policies.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez legally entered the U.S. with a tourist visa in August 2023. That visa expired in February 2024, DHS said. In April 2024, he filed an application for lawful permanent resident status based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. That citizen, who was not named, also has a connection to the Sinaloa cartel, DHS said.",
      "On Dec. 17, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told ICE that Ch\u00e1vez is an \"egregious public safety threat.\" Internal records from the Biden administration showed that Ch\u00e1vez was not an immigration enforcement priority, DHS said. On Jan. 4, Ch\u00e1vez was allowed to reenter the country through the San Ysidro port of entry on the Mexico border, DHS said.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has faced legal trouble in the U.S. in the past. In January 2012, he was arrested by the California Highway Patrol and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and driving without a license, DHS said. He was convicted on the first charge and sentenced to 13 days in jail and three years' probation.",
      "In January 2023, an arrest warrant was issued for Ch\u00e1vez, alleging his involvement in organized crime. In January 2024, he was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department and charged with illegal possession of any assault weapon and manufacture or import of a short-barreled rifle, DHS said. ESPN reported\u00a0in January 2024 that he unlawfully possessed two AR-style guns without serial numbers. Ch\u00e1vez was convicted and spent several days in jail, ESPN reported, before being released on a $50,000 bond on the condition he enter a residential treatment program.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's attorney, Michael Goldstein, told The Associated Press that the current allegations \"are outrageous and simply another headline to terrorize the community.\" Goldstein also told The AP they were due in court on Monday related to the 2024 gun possession charges.",

      "Michael Madsen, the actor known for appearances in several Quentin Tarantino films, including \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" and \"The Hateful Eight,\" has died, his manager told CBS News.\u00a0He was 67.",
      "Madsen apparently went into cardiac arrest and was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning, manager Ron Smith said.",
      "\"In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,\" managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a statement.",
      "\"Michael was also preparing to release a new book called Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems currently being edited. Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many,\" they added.",
      "Originally from Chicago, Madsen appeared in more than 300 movies and TV shows throughout his more than four decades in Hollywood, according to IMDB.",
      "He began his career at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater.",
      "\"I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of old friend Mike Madsen,\" Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney said in a statement. \"Although I knew him years ago, it was very memorable, as he acted in a production of 'Of Mice and Men' which I directed. Michael was a car mechanic when we started rehearsals. He wrote long handwritten letters to me for years about how art saved his life. He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",
      "He is perhaps best known for his role as Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the iconic scene in which he tortures a police officer while the 1973 Stealers Wheel hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background.",
      "While usually not playing the lead role, his unmistakable gruff voice made him a memorable presence in smaller roles and even bit parts in films like \"Sin City,\" \"Donnie Brasco\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"",
      "Madsen has also published several collections of poetry, including \"Burning in Paradise\" and \"Expecting Rain.\"",
      "\"His work reflects the same gritty realism and emotional undercurrent that defines his acting,\" his representatives said in a statement. \"In addition to acting and writing, he is an accomplished photographer and has produced a number of independent projects.\"",
      "During a speech at his handprint ceremony at Los Angeles' famous TCL Chinese Theatre in 2020, Madsen reflected, \"I could have been a bricklayer. I could have been an architect. I could have been a garbageman. I could have been nothing. But I got lucky. I got lucky as an actor.\"",
      "Madsen also referenced \"mistakes\" he had made in his life during that speech, which was mainly addressed to his wife, DeAnna Morgan. Madsen pleaded no contest to a DUI charge in 2019, which had come within 10 years of another DUI charge. He was sentenced to four days in jail and five years probation, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "He received a $500 citation for a misdemeanor after allegedly trespassing on a property in 2022, People reported at the time, which came just a month after his son, Hudson, died by suicide at 26.

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market means solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "The health care sector added 39,000 jobs.",
      "The Labor Department also revised up its numbers for April and May by a collective 16,000, a further indication the job market remains on solid ground.",
      "While the labor market remains sturdy, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Federal Chair Jerome Powell has\u00a0said tariffs could start to hobble economic activity and drive up inflation this summer. At a gathering of central bankers in Portugal earlier this week, Powell said\u00a0the Fed has held off lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "What the experts are saying",
      "Economists underlined that the labor market continues to persevere despite considerable economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Today's stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators,\" Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a research note.",
      "The healthy level of job growth likely means the Fed will hold off cutting rates at its meeting this month, experts say. At its most recent meeting, the central bank penciled in two rate cuts by year-end, although some economists predict just one.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks U.S. inflation stemming from tariffs is likely to peak by the fourth quarter, giving the Fed room to lower rates in December to propel economic growth.",
      "\"While there were some elements of softness beneath the better-than-expected headlines, the June employment report was strong enough to allow the Federal Reserve to keep policy on hold as it monitors the impact of tariffs on inflation,\" she said in a research note.",
      "Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, said in an email that the latest job numbers could lead to a relief rally for U.S. stocks. Stocks were up slightly after the opening bell. The markets close early today and will not be open on Friday due to the July 4 holiday.",

    "summary": "The House and Senate passed the massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda this week. Here's what's in it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda Thursday, sending the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" to the president's desk ahead of a July 4 deadline.",
      "The House approved the bill in a 218 to 214 vote Thursday, after the Senate narrowly approved\u00a0the bill Tuesday in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "At the center the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was slated to sunset at the end of the year. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by significant cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own initial version of the legislation last month, with some key differences\u00a0to the final Senate-crafted version. The lower chamber approved the Senate's changes Thursday, sending the measure to the president's desk.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, wasn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules. The parliamentarian also weighed in on what's known as the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the initial House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the initial House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the initial House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Green energy policies",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",
      "It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems.",
      "The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities. Existing contracts and grants under the program are not affected.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the initial House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the initial House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress aimed to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the bill, $300 less than the initial House-passed hike.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The Senate\u00a0version\u00a0varies from the initial House-passed provisions on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the early House version was uncapped.",
      "Under the initial House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would have qualified for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version phases out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The bill seeks to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year.",
      "Tracy J.  Wholf and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee man pardoned by President Trump in January for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol will nevertheless serve a life sentence for plotting to attack FBI agents and seeking to incite a \"civil war,\" according to prosecutors.",
      "Edward Kelley, who was the fourth U.S. Capitol rioter to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021, faced a separate prosecution for targeting federal agents while he was being investigated for his role in the Capitol attack.",
      "The Justice Department argued Kelley created a \"kill list\" of FBI agents and others who investigated his role in the Jan. 6 siege. Prosecutors said Kelley \"distributed this list \u2014 along with videos containing images of certain FBI employees identified on the list \u2014 to a co-conspirator as part of his 'mission.'\"",
      "A jury convicted Kelley of conspiracy charges in November, and a federal judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced Kelley to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "Though Kelley was among the more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants pardoned on January 20, 2025, the pardon did not extend to Kelley's conspiracy case in Tennessee. Last month, prosecutors argued, \"Edward Kelley is remorseless and has shown neither a capacity nor desire to rehabilitate. On the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination.\"",
      "Prosecutors also said, \"The proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home.\"",
      "They argued Kelley viewed \"the FBI as the enemy and, as such, were valid targets in the civil war because they served as the 'eyes and ears' of the government.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said, \"The defendant identified 36 individual federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel to target for assassination. He created a list of his targets which included names, titles, and cell phone numbers.\"",
      "Kelley is one of several Jan. 6 defendants who face prison time in separate criminal cases, including some who have been arrested again after their pardons were issued.",
      "A Florida defendant was arrested later in January 2025 on a gun charge. A Texas defendant who was freed from prison by the Trump pardon was later arrested, suspected of attempted child solicitation.",
      "Kelley's role on Jan. 6, 2021, was distinct. Security camera photos showed he was the fourth person to unlawfully enter the Capitol building at the forefront of the mob and he was accused of being part of a group that assaulted an officer.

The ship was on a week-long round-trip tour of Alaska that departed from Seattle, according to ship tracking site CruiseMapper.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence arm plans to cut nearly three-quarters of its full-time employees, shaving its Office of Intelligence & Analysis down from about 1,000 staff to just 275, according to four sources briefed on the matter.",
      "The exact timing of the cuts remains unclear; sources tell CBS News the staff reductions have been in the works for months but were temporarily on hold because of rising tensions overseas after the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The decision has raised concerns among the nation's police and intelligence gathering agencies, as the U.S. reckons with a heightened threat environment.",
      "DHS' Office of Intelligence & Analysis \u2014 created after the September 11 terrorist attacks \u2014 is the only member of the U.S. intelligence community tasked with sharing threat information to state, local, tribal and territorial governments across the country.",
      "A DHS spokesperson confirmed the cuts in a statement, saying the department is getting \"back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.\"",
      "\"DHS component leads have identified redundant positions and non-critical programs within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Department is actively working to identify other wasteful positions and programs that do not align with DHS's mission to prioritize American safety and enforce our laws.\"",
      "Last month, the current head of the agency, Daniel Tamburello, informed the intelligence agency's workforce that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had signed off on plans to slash the agency by hundreds of employees, with others reassigned to other DHS components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "This week, House and Senate lawmakers wrote to Noem and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, warning them to avoid \"this drastic and unilateral step and instead to consult with Congress about alternative ways to make I&A as effective and efficient as possible.\"",
      "\"At a time when DHS is rightly warning about an elevated threat environment from terrorists and cartels, we should be focused on plugging security gaps rather than senselessly creating new ones,\" Democratic Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Jim Himes of Connecticut wrote Wednesday, along with Michigan Sen. Gary Peters and minority leaders on the House Homeland Security Committee, House Intelligence Committee and Senate Homeland Security Committee.",
      "Several law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, County Sheriffs of America and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies \u2014 also penned a letter to Noem, pressing her to reconsider. They warned that any downsizing of the intelligence agency could prevent \"vital intelligence\" from reaching the officers and investigators whose job it is to detect and disrupt threats and could create \"dangerous blind spots in our homeland security network.\"",
      "\"[Intelligence and Analysis] is the only component of the U.S. intelligence community with a statutory mandate to share threat information with state and local partners,\" the letter stated. \"The current threat landscape makes our partnership with [Intelligence and Analysis] more critical than ever. Ongoing Middle East conflicts heighten risks of foreign-directed and homegrown violent extremism, as demonstrated by the recent antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado. Transnational criminal organizations continue to shift fentanyl trafficking routes, requiring real time intelligence to intercept deadly substances before they reach our streets\u2026 Weakening [Intelligence & Analysis] would undermine our ability to detect and prevent threats before they occur.\"",
      "Mike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, a network of 2,000 public safety officials operating as hubs of information sharing and threat analysis for local law enforcement, also wrote to congressional leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last month. He warned that \"any reduction in [Intelligence and Analysis'] field-based presence, staffing, or engagement capabilities would negatively impact the critical information flow and coordination necessary to identify and mitigate emerging threats to our communities.\"",
      "Leaders within the National Sheriffs' Associations had a similar message for congressional leaders last month, writing in a letter to GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, that \"[Intelligence & Analysis] is a critical partner in the operations of many of the country's regional fusion centers\u2026 at the center of detecting threats from organized crime, threats to election security, and threats from domestic violence extremism.\"",
      "Last month, DHS activated its National Terrorism Advisory System, alerting more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide of possible \"violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel, or linked to the US government or military in the Homeland.\"",
      "\"US law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020,\" the bulletin read. \"During this timeframe, the Iranian government has also unsuccessfully targeted critics of its regime who are based in the Homeland for lethal attack.",

      "The cuts were first reported by NextGov/FCW.",
      "DHS' intelligence wing has faced some criticism in recent years for its collection of intelligence on journalists and protesters during the George Floyd protests in 2020, plus its failure to disseminate critical intelligence ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
      "While testifying before Congress, Matthew Kozma, Trump's new pick to lead Intelligence & Analysis, underscored the importance of reinforcing the federal government's talent pipeline, telling lawmakers, \"It's imperative that [the agency's] analysts be informed, educated and trained on the latest know-how and toolsets to optimally apply available knowledge, insights, and acumen for mission accomplishment.\"",
      "\"Our intelligence and analytical tradecraft requires a unique combination of skill, curiosity, dedication, vigilance, and trustworthiness to ensure that the information and intelligence we extract and share is correct, comprehensive, and corroborated,\" Kozma said in his opening statement.",

      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",

      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

    "story": [
      "Top-ranking Food and Drug Administration officials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.",
      "In a memorandum following Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.",
      "Prasad was named earlier this year to replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad was later elevated to the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "Novavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.",
      "Prasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"",
      "\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.",
      "A separate memo released by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.",
      "The agency's career scientists had initially concluded on April 1 that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.",
      "\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.",
      "Documents released last month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.",
      "\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"",
      "The New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.",
      "Under Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.",
      "\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had said at an event last year.",
      "In past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, who questioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials \u2014 Dr. Phil Krause \u2014 is also now criticizing moves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.",
      "Agency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.",
      "Months before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.",
      "Hoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"",
      "\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political \u2014 it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.",
      "Makary and Prasad also made this argument in May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.",
      "The FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.",

      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he does not plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

The cases involving transgender rights come after the court's conservative majority upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors last month.",
      "Beginning in its next term in October, the Supreme Court will review lower court decisions in favor of transgender athletes from Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the bans in their respective states. The Idaho case involves the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, while the dispute over West Virginia's law involves the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "The issue of transgender athletes participating in girls' and women's sports has exploded at the state level in recent years. Idaho was the first state to pass a law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in women and girls' sports, and two dozen have since followed suit. Roughly half of the states have also passed laws that bar certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "At the federal level, President Trump signed an executive order in February that aimed to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The president's order directs that under Title IX, educational institutions that receive federal funds cannot \"deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.\"",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's executive order, the NCAA announced it had updated its participation policy for transgender athletes to bar student-athletes who were assigned male at birth from competing on women's teams. On Wednesday, the University of Pennsylvania said it would no longer allow transgender athletes\u00a0to participate in women's sports as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school after it awarded Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, a spot on the women's swimming team.",
      "\"Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,\" said Joshua Block of the ACLU, which is representing the athletes in the cases, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson. \"We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.\"",
      "West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey said he is confident the Supreme Court will uphold his state's law.",
      "\"It's a great day, as female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \"The people of West Virginia know that it's unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that's why we passed this commonsense law preserving women's sports for women.\"",
      "Idaho's law",
      "Idaho's measure, called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, requires athletic teams or sports to be designated based on biological sex, and says those for women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\" If there is any dispute about a student's sex, the law says schools must ask for a health examination and consent form verifying the student's biological sex.",
      "After Idaho's GOP-led legislature passed the legislation, Hecox, a transgender woman who was attending Boise State University, sued, arguing the law violates Title IX and the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law. Hecox was a freshman when she filed her lawsuit in April 2020, and she said she wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore, but couldn't do so because of Idaho's ban.",
      "Hecox has received treatment for gender dysphoria since 2019, including testosterone suppression and estrogen, according to court papers.",
      "A federal district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding that Hecox was likely to succeed in her challenge. U.S. District Judge David Nye wrote in August 2020 that the ban \"on its face discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\"",
      "Additionally, Nye found the measure discriminates against transgender women by categorically excluding them from female sports and subjects participants in female athletics to a \"potentially invasive\" process for verifying a student's biological sex.",
      "As a result of the district court's order, Hecox tried out for the women's NCAA running teams at Boise State, but did not qualify. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running at the university, according to court filings.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the district court's injunction as applied to Hecox, finding that Idaho's ban targets all transgender girls and women regardless of their testosterone levels or whether they have received certain gender-transition treatments.",
      "The appeals court said that the record in the case doesn't back \"the conclusion that all transgender women, including those like Lindsay who receive hormone therapy, have a physiological advantage over cisgender women.\"",
      "The West Virginia law",
      "West Virginia's legislature passed its law, the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021, which restricts participation on girls' sports teams based on biological sex, defined as a student's \"reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" The law prohibits transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports at every level, including club and intramural activities.",
      "State officials have argued the law aims to protect equality in girls' sports, and it does not prevent anyone from trying out for men's, boys' or co-ed teams.",
      "\"It is only when students are playing skill and contact sports \u2014 where biological sex has a direct effect\u2014\u00a0 that biological males (again, however they might identify) cannot compete with females,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson, who was then 11 years old, challenged the measure, arguing it is unconstitutional and violates Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Pepper-Jackson, now a teenager, was born male but began identifying as female at \"an early age,\" lawyers wrote in court papers. She has received puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy.\u00a0 When Pepper-Jackson was a rising sixth grader and preparing to begin middle school, she was informed by her school's principal that she could not participate in girls' school sports because of West Virginia's law.",
      "A federal judge in July 2022 temporarily blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling its application would likely violate Title IX and the Constitution. As a result of the injunction, she was able to participate in her middle school girls' cross-country and track-and-field teams.",
      "In early 2023, U.S. District judge Joseph Goodwin ruled for the state and upheld the law. He also lifted the earlier injunction that had blocked enforcement against Pepper-Jackson.",
      "\"A transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically,\" he wrote. \"The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.\"",
      "Pepper-Jackson appealed and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit for emergency relief, which would've allowed her to participate in the spring 2023 track-and-field season. The appeals court granted her request, after which West Virginia officials sought the Supreme Court's intervention. The high court then denied the state's bid to allow it to enforce the law against Pepper-Jackson, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissenting.",
      "A divided 4th Circuit issued a ruling on the merits of the case in April 2024, finding West Virginia's law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Citing Pepper-Jackson's years-long identity as a girl, social transition, name change, updated birth certificate listing her as a female and medical treatments, the 4th Circuit's majority said offering her a \"'choice' between not participating in sports and participating only on boys teams is no real choice at all.\"",
      "\"By participating on boys teams, B.P.J. would be sharing the field with boys who are larger, stronger, and faster than her because of the elevated levels of circulating testosterone she lacks,\" Judge Toby Heytens wrote. \"The act thus exposes B.P.J. to the very harms Title IX is meant to prevent by effectively 'exclud[ing]' her from 'participation in' all non-coed sports entirely.\"",
      "But in their appeal to the Supreme Court, West Virginia officials argued that the 4th Circuit's decision threatens Title IX's promise of equal athletic opportunity for women and girls.",
      "\"In the Fourth Circuit, females must now compete against biological males \u2014 and all the physiological advantages they possess \u2014 in all athletic events,\" lawyers for the state wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argued it's too soon for the Supreme Court to weigh in, as the 4th Circuit's decision is the first and only from a federal appeals court to address Title IX's protections for transgender athletes.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to review a blocked Montana law that would require physicians to obtain a parent's consent before performing an abortion on a minor.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to review a blocked Montana law that would require physicians to obtain a parent's consent before performing an abortion on a minor, leaving intact a state high court decision that invalidated the requirement.",
      "In rejecting the appeal from Montana state officials, the high court turned away what the officials said was a chance to clarify the scope of parents' right to be informed of and participate in their children's medical decisions, including abortion.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote a separate statement respecting the court's decision not to take up the case. Alito said the case is a \"poor vehicle\" for deciding the question at hand.",
      "\"It is therefore especially important that the denial of review is not read by interested parties or other courts as a rejection of the argument that the petition asks us to decide,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The long-running dispute dates back to 2013, when the Montana legislature approved the Parental Consent for Abortion Act, which requires physicians to obtain notarized written consent from a parent or guardian before performing an abortion for patients under the age of 18. The law allows a minor who cannot get parental consent to access abortion care through a court order.",
      "Before the consent law took effect, in July 2013, Planned Parenthood sued to block the measure as a violation of the Montana Constitution. The Montana attorney general agreed to a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the consent requirement, and it has never gone into effect. A separate state law that requires parental notification before an abortion is performed on a minor is in place.",
      "The case languished for several years until the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade. A state trial court ruled that the consent requirement violated the Montana Constitution because it interfered with a minor's right to privacy.",
      "The state appealed, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the district court's decision. It found that when evaluated under the most stringent level of judicial review, strict scrutiny, the consent law was not narrowly tailored to any of Montana's compelling interests that they said justified the requirement.",
      "The consent rule, the state supreme court found, violates the \"fundamental right of a minor to control her body and destiny,\" as guaranteed by the state constitution.",
      "Montana officials asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the state court's decision earlier this year and warned that its view of a minor's right to privacy under the state constitution threatens parental rights under the federal Constitution to direct their child's medical care, including decisions about abortion and access to contraception.",
      "\"State experimentation with the scope of a minor's state constitutional right to seek an abortion threatens to erode parents' federal fundamental rights,\" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen wrote in urging the Supreme Court to take up the appeal.",
      "State officials are asking the justices to decide whether a fundamental right to direct the care and custody of their children includes a right to \"know and participate in decisions\" about their medical care, including getting an abortion.",
      "But lawyers for Planned Parenthood urged the high court to turn away the case because it involves unique provisions of Montana's Constitution \u2014 one that grants all Montana citizens the right to individual privacy and a second that guarantees minors the same state constitutional rights as adults.",
      "State officials, they wrote in a filing,\u00a0\"seek to use the parental right as a cudgel against a minor's rights.\"",
      "\"The court's protection of a minor's right to privacy is not any less of a deserving counterweight to the federal Constitution's guarantee of parental rights, simply because that protection inheres in Montana's constitution,\" Planned Parenthood lawyers wrote.",
      "The Montana Supreme Court recognized the right to abortion under its constitution in 1999, and it is legal up to the point of fetal viability. In the 2024 election, Montana voters approved an initiative that amended the state constitution to \"expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.\"",

Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",

      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",

      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

      "A 1983 trial had found five people guilty of embezzlement and receiving stolen goods over the plundering of the Prince de Conty.",
      "Gladu was not among them.",
      "Held in custody in 2022, he confessed to having retrieved 16 gold bars from the ship during around 40 dives on the site between 1976 and 1999.",
      "He said he had sold them all in 2006 to a retired member of the military living in Switzerland.",
      "But he denied ever having given any to his American friends the Courters.",
      "He had known the author and her husband since the 1980s, and they had joined him on holiday on his catamaran in Greece in 2011, in the Caribbean in 2014 and in French Polynesia in 2015, investigators found.",
      "The Courter couple were detained in the United Kingdom in 2022, then put under house arrest.",

      "They found they had sold 18 ingots for more than $192,000, including some via online sale platform eBay.",

      "The U.S. couple's lawyer, Gregory Levy, said they had had no idea what they were getting into.",
      "\"The Courters accepted because they are profoundly nice people. They didn't see the harm as in the United States, regulations for gold are completely different from those in France,\" he said, adding the couple had not profited from the sales.",

      "The announcement came about a week after President Trump met with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during a NATO summit in the Netherlands.

Guo allegedly submitted a flight plan that indicated his plans to fly over Punta Arenas, but not farther than that, according to Cristoso.",

      "The latest find, announced by Admiral Juan Ricardo Rozo at a press conference, is the first reported discovery in South American waters of a drone narco sub. In May 2024, Italian police announced the seizure of a small remote-controlled sub likely intended to transport drugs as part of an international drug trafficking network.",
      "The Colombian navy said the drone semisubmersible was owned by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug trafficking group and had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine.",

      "Leo's looming visit has raised hopes of a new boost for tourism in the small town. He will be there from July 6 until July 20, according to an article published last month by the Vatican's official news outlet.",
      "As the first pope to visit the village on the shores of Lake Albano \u2014 home to only about 8,900 people \u2014 in over a decade, Leo has Castel Gandolfo's mayor and business owners hoping that other tourists will follow, perhaps even trying to overlap to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.",
      "Pope Francis, who died in April, shunned many of the trappings and splendor that the papacy can convey, deciding to spend his summers at his humble Vatican residence instead of venturing to Gandolfo.",
      "While he's there, Chicago-born Pope Leo will stay at a walled-off building owned by the Vatican \u2014 not at the traditional papal residence in the town, the Apostolic Palace of Castel Gandolfo.",
      "\"Pope Leo has given us a wonderful gift,\" Stefano Carosi, the owner of a local coffee shop, told the Reuters news agency. \"The pope has always been important here\u2026 because he attracts people.\"",

      "Popes have vacationed at Castel Gandolfo for years in the summer, taking advantage of its 1,400 feet of altitude next to the lake to seek cooler climes than in Rome, where an early summer European heat wave has already driven temperatures to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Leo won't stay at the papal palace, which, along with its ornate Renaissance-style gardens, was first acquired by the Vatican in 1596 as a debt payment from an aristocratic family. Pope Francis turned the palace into a museum during his papacy, opening its gardens to tourists. The museum will remain open during Leo's visit.",
      "While Francis never stayed at Castel Gandolfo, residents say his decision to open the palace as a public museum has benefited the community.",
      "The owner of a mosaic studio in the lakeside town, Marina Rossi, said tourists now come much more frequently, as opposed to only coming during the summer to see the pope.",
      "\"It was more of a hit-and-run tourism, because there was the audience and then they would leave,\" she told Reuters. \"Now there is a steady flow of tourism throughout the whole year.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dharamshala, India \u2014 The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that started when he indicated he might be the last person to hold the role. His having a successor would mean he would be reincarnated.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said at prayer celebrations ahead of his upcoming 90th birthday that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signaling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama's succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing Wednesday said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\"",
      "Mao said the process must \"follow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\"",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\"In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \"unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"",
      "\"We not only strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\" he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama's reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent's death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-israel-gaza-ceasefire-hamas-reaction-aid-seekers-killed-near-ghf-hubs/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:52:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says Israel has agreed to conditions for a Gaza ceasefire and he's urging Hamas to back it, but neither side has committed to anything yet.",
    "story": [
      "It appeared on Wednesday that President Trump likely still has some deal-making to do before he can claim to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to end the devastating war in Gaza. Mr. Trump said in a Tuesday evening social media post that Israel had \"agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\" a 60-day ceasefire, and he called on Hamas to accept the deal, warning the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that \"it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Israeli sources told CBS News on Wednesday that while there was strong backing in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet for the terms in the proposal, Israel was not committing to it yet, stressing that the government had voiced its backing to U.S. officials for a proposed framework for a ceasefire deal, not a final agreement.",
      "In a statement, Hamas credited mediators Qatar and Egypt for having \"exerted intensive efforts to bridge the gap between the parties and reach a framework agreement that would pave the way for a serious round of negotiations.\"",
      "\"We are approaching this with a high sense of responsibility and are conducting national consultations to discuss the proposals presented by the mediators,\" Hamas said, reiterating its long-standing calls for a truce that brings the war to an end, sees Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza, \"and urgently delivers relief to our people in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't offer any details of the proposed deal in his post on Tuesday evening, but he said that Qatar and Egypt \u2014 which have been key partners to the U.S. as it attempts to broker an agreement to end the nearly two-year war \u2014 would \"deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, in a post on social media Wednesday, said there was \"a great majority in the government and also among the people for a framework to release hostages. If there is an opportunity to do so \u2014 we must not miss it!\"",
      "But that claim of cohesion may belie a potentially significant hurdle for Netanyahu as he prepares to head to Washington this weekend to meet with Mr. Trump, who's made it clear he wants to see a deal to end the war within days.",
      "Numerous Israeli media outlets reported Wednesday that one of the most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, had called on far-right nationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to join him in blocking the government's approval of the ceasefire deal.",
      "Neither Smotrich nor Ben-Gvir confirmed any discussion about blocking the agreement, but in a short post on social media, Ben-Gvir said the war in Gaza should not end \"a moment before defeating Hamas.\" Both men have been vocal in rejecting peace deals with Hamas, insisting that the group must be completely destroyed, not negotiated with.",
      "Yair Golan, leader of the Israeli opposition Democrats party, accused Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in a social media post of \"leading a bloc to prevent the return of the hostages.\" He said they \"do not deserve to sit around the government table. And whoever continues to allow them to sit there does not deserve to lead Israel for even one more day.\"",
      "While the real prospects of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a ceasefire in the short time frame that Mr. Trump is hoping for remained unclear, even the suggestion that peace could be looming may raise hopes for Gazans who risk their lives every day just to line up lining up for food.",
      "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation responds to criticism",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health says at least 640 civilians have been shot to death in recent weeks trying to access desperately needed humanitarian supplies, including more than 400 at distribution sites run by the heavily criticized U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Since it began operating in the war-torn enclave on May 26, GHF has faced near daily claims of aid-seekers being killed by Israeli forces as they try to reach its four hubs in Gaza.",
      "Earlier this week, more than 170 humanitarian groups called for the opaquely run organization \u2014   which has never revealed its funding or management structure \u2014   to be disbanded and all aid efforts in Gaza to be reorganized under the long-established United Nations-led system. Those international humanitarian efforts have been largely blocked by Israel since March.",
      "The Israeli military says it works with the GHF to enable aid distribution without the risk of food and other goods being stolen by Hamas.",
      "The Trump administration has backed that reasoning and refused to support other means of food dispersal in Gaza, instead calling on other nations and institutions to work with the GHF, which replaced some 400 international aid distribution points in the Palestinian territory with just four of its hubs. Those hubs are run by armed U.S. private security contractors, and the Israeli military controls access to them.",
      "All established humanitarian agencies have refused to work with the GHF, saying it forces Palestinians to dislocate and trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles, but the Trump administration announced late last week its first public support for the group: $30 million in funding.",
      "The State Department wouldn't say, when that funding was announced, if the funds had already been transferred to GHF, or which U.S. government account they would come from.",
      "The GHF has declined to respond to multiple questions from CBS News about its connections with the U.S. and Israeli governments and its funding, and it had, until this week, also declined to be interviewed by CBS News about its operations. On Tuesday, however, the GHF's director, American evangelical reverend Johnnie Moore, a former adviser to President Trump on religious matters, agreed to an interview via Zoom.",
      "Our first question was about the reports CBS News has received since GHF began its operations, directly from doctors and eyewitnesses, that Israeli soldiers have repeatedly opened fire on unarmed civilians trying to reach its aid hubs.",
      "\"I do not want to diminish these reports, but we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites,\" Moore told CBS News.",
      "Asked how many more people would die before GHF changed the way it operates, Moore called the framing of the question \"inappropriate,\" and said the group's \"whole reason for existing is to give food to these people so they can live.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014   and those of the White House \u2014   for the United Nations and its various humanitarian agencies to join GHF's efforts in Gaza.",
      "\"We've said again and again to the U.N., to the WFP (World Food Program), join us in this effort,\" Moore said, before asking CBS News' correspondent, \"with respect, why don't you join us? I'm asking you to help us run the operation if you think there is a better way to do this.\"",
      "Asked how GHF has been able to verify who exactly receives the aid it provides on the ground \u2014   which Moore has stressed does not reach Hamas \u2014 the reverend responded with a question: \"Do you have anything positive to say about what we are doing?\"",
      "\"Do you think it is acceptable that people die every day trying to access aid? Is there not a better way to do this?\" CBS News asked again.",
      "\"We have made a decision that it is worth working in a war zone,\" Moore said, \"as deadly as it is, because Gazans deserve food.\"",
      "Moore would not respond to questions about how GHF operates or who funds the organization, beside the $30 million contribution announced this week by the Trump administration.",

      "The snake was found on Tuesday as passengers were boarding Virgin Australia Flight VA337 at Melbourne Airport bound for Brisbane, according to snake catcher Mark Pelley.",

      "\"It wasn't until after I caught the snake that I realized that it wasn't venomous. Until that point, it looked very dangerous to me,\" Pelley said.",
      "Most of the world's most venomous snakes are native to Australia.",
      "When Pelley entered the cargo hold, the snake was half hidden behind a panel and could have disappeared deeper into the plane.",
      "Pelley said he told an aircraft engineer and airline staff that they would have to evacuate the aircraft if the snake disappeared inside the plane.",
      "\"I said to them if I don't get this in one shot, it's going to sneak through the panels and you're going to have to evacuate the plane because at that stage I did not know what kind of snake it was,\" Pelley said.",
      "\"But thankfully, I got it on the first try and captured it,\" Pelley added. \"If I didn't get it that first time, the engineers and I would be pulling apart a (Boeing) 737 looking for a snake still right now.\"",
      "Pelley said he had taken 30 minutes to drive to the airport and was then delayed by security before he could reach the airliner.",
      "An airline official said the flight was delayed around two hours.",
      "Because the snake is native to the Brisbane region, Pelley suspects it came aboard inside a passenger's luggage and escaped during the two-hour flight from Brisbane to Melbourne.",
      "For quarantine reasons, the snake can't be returned to the wild.",
      "The snake, which is a protected species, has been given to a Melbourne veterinarian to find a home with a licensed snake keeper.",

      "Snakes have made cameos on Australian jetliners before. In 2013, stunned Qantas Airways passengers watched out their windows as a large python clung to a plane's wing during a two-hour flight from Australia's northeastern city of Cairns to Papua New Guinea.",
      "Snakes have been spotted on passenger jets in other countries. In 2022, a snake was discovered on board a United Airlines passenger flight from Tampa Bay, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey. The non-venomous snake was removed from the plane by airport staff after the flight landed in Newark.",

The song repeats the slogan hailing the Nazi German leader and includes a direct sample from a speech Hitler gave in 1935.",
      "Speaking to ABC, Immigration Minister Tony Burke revealed the ban on Ye while discussing the reported cancellation of a visa for Israeli-American tech personality Hillel Fuld, over a comment he posted declaring: \"Islamophobia is rational.\"",

In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",
      "The transition from clay to grass has proven tough for most players, and the last woman to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season was Serena Williams a decade ago.",
      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",
      "\"I love playing on grass. I feel that this year we are kind of friends,\" Yastremska said with a laugh. \"I hope the road will continue for me here.\"",

      "\"His affairs, he later admitted to Richard Schickel, \u2018just became\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u00a0\u2026 addictive\u00a0\u2026 like you have to have another cigarette,\u2019\" Levy wrote in the book, quoting Eastwood.",

      "Eastwood married Johnson in 1953. Throughout their 21-year marriage, Eastwood had many affairs with various women and fathered multiple children.",
      "\"There were many other women, some from the ranks of classmates, some encountered at the nightspots and jazz clubs that he frequented, some from among his neighbors at the apartment complex in Studio City, near Universal, to which he and Maggie had moved when he first went under contract to the studio,\" Levy wrote in the book.",
      "\"The atmosphere of that small apartment building \u2014 which, naturally, was centered around a swimming pool \u2014 not only encouraged sexual adventures but facilitated them; several of Clint\u2019s friends from Oakland, Seattle, and Fort Ord moved into the place or similar places nearby, meaning that there were always apartments readily available for a quick tryst \u2014 and buddies willing to help him cover his tracks.\"",
      "According to Levy, Eastwood was always upfront about his behavior and allegedly had an \"understanding\" with Johnson.",
      "\"It wasn\u2019t entirely evident, though, that he needed such help. As a friend put it, \u2018Clint goes where he wants, does what he wants \u2014 goes to dinner with a girl if he wants. Maggie doesn\u2019t say a thing. Clint is the undisputed boss.' He referred to himself half-jokingly as a \u2019married bachelor,\u2019 but there were significant hints that his wife knew the score and was okay with it,\" Levy wrote.",

      "Eastwood allegedly said of his relationship with Johnson, \"There\u2019s no ownership in this marriage. My soul is my own. Maggie knows this. Possession is the worst thing. I\u2019m hard to live with. \u2026 I\u2019m moody, and lots of the time I\u2019d rather be alone. \u2026 It took Maggie a while, but she learned.\"",

      "\"But they stayed together through these lean years, despite living near enough to her family for her to make other choices, so she either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care about his sexual entanglements \u2014 or she believed that they were his business and nobody else\u2019s, not even hers,\" Levy wrote.",
      "\"It seemed to some who knew the couple that she thrived. \u2018She\u2019s got more steel than a hardware store,\u2019 a friend noted. \u2018Clint talks to her about everything.\u2019 And Clint himself admitted, \u2018She is the very best friend I have.

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial jurors were deadlocked Tuesday after reaching a verdict on four of the five counts against the rapper.",
      "Two months after the trial kicked off, and nearly 14 hours into deliberations, jurors told Judge Arun Subramanian that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision on a racketeering charge.",
      "The prosecution called more than 30 witnesses to the stand throughout seven weeks of testimony, while Diddy's defense team rested without calling any witnesses on their behalf \u2014 a move considered \"high stakes poker\" by former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Trey Gowdy.",
      "DIDDY JURY REACHES PARTIAL VERDICT IN SEX TRAFFICKING, RACKETEERING TRIAL",
      "Diddy's defense played \"high stakes poker\" by not calling witnesses to the stand, experts say. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Usually, when defense does not call witnesses, that defendant is called an inmate,\" Gowdy explained. \"I've said that my entire career. That's a fancy way of calling someone an inmate. You gotta give the jury a reason for reasonable doubt and to simply say the prosecution hasn\u2019t met its burden \u2026 most jurors don\u2019t really understand what that burden is.\"",
      "He added, \"Gotta give the jury a reason for doubt\u00a0and if you don't put up a very significant defense, all you do is cross-examine government witnesses, then you're going to be an inmate.\"",
      "DIDDY DEFENSE CLAIMS HE WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED, WHILE PROSECUTION SAYS RAPPER THOUGHT HE WAS 'UNTOUCHABLE'",
      "Diddy told the court last week that it was his decision not to testify in his sex crimes case. The judge asked if Diddy understood he had the right to testify or not testify, and if he had discussed his rights with his attorney. Diddy responded, \"Yes, thoroughly,\" before admitting it was \"solely my decision\" to not testify in his sex crimes trial.",
      "Jurors began deliberating on Monday, June 30, and of the five counts, could not agree on a verdict for the racketeering charge, one of the most serious counts against the disgraced music mogul. A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence. The transportation to engage in prostitution charge could carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion may carry a 20-year sentence.",
      "Jurors were unable to reach a verdict Tuesday on all five counts in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"It\u2019s very complicated \u2014 most lawyers cannot explain RICO, so to expect 12 people, average citizen jurors to understand a criminal enterprise, predicate acts \u2026 it\u2019s just a lot to ask,\" Gowdy said. \"There\u2019s a reason to charge it even if you don\u2019t win. It opens evidentiary doors that might be closed, so lots of times prosecutors will charge something because it enables you to get extra evidence before a jury even though you don't really expect to get a guilty verdict on that count.\"",

      "Criminal defense attorney John W. Day, owner of the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based law practice John Day Law, told Fox News Digital that jurors may have had a difficult time comprehending the RICO charge.",
      "\"Was Diddy's high-flying and maybe disturbing lifestyle just that, or can you really pick out a criminal enterprise that is the equivalent of an organized crime family?\" Day said. \"But tomorrow morning the judge will be hoping that after a night of thinking about it, the jurors will have second thoughts about a split verdict on RICO \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 and come back with a unanimous verdict on that most serious charge.\"",

      "\"So what happens is now they're forced to go back in there, and there's probably going to be a lot of frustration back there, more fighting back and forth,\" Becker said. \"My understanding is that the jurors' verbiage was something to the effect of that they're at a point where there's unpersuadable opinions on both sides. So clearly some of the jurors thinking, 'Well, obviously he's guilty.'\"",
      "The judge instructed the jury to continue deliberating for now. A second option would be to give supplemental jury instructions. Lastly, the jury could return a partial verdict.

      "\"Both sides stated that they do not want to accept a partial verdict,\" attorney David S. Seltzer told Fox News Digital. \"This forces the jury to render a complete verdict, which ultimately could lead to a hung jury on the count at issue if they cannot render a verdict on all counts, and thus lead to a possible retrial on the hung count.",

      "Instead, she recommends opting for whole-grain and high-fiber breads that break down more slowly, helping to stabilize blood sugar and improve long-term glycemic control.",
      "When choosing a bread, it\u2019s important to read labels carefully and assess the ingredient list, Palinski-Wade advised.",

      "\"When choosing bread with fewer preservatives and simpler ingredients, consumers need to be aware that the bread will not last as long, and may need to be frozen and toasted to eventually make use of an entire loaf.\" (iStock)",
      "\"This is because the flour is very refined \u2014 removing fiber, fats, proteins and bran, which all slow absorption \u2014 and is also very finely machine ground. This fine grind creates white flour, which is a dust that is quickly absorbed by intestinal cells.\"",
      "The texturizers and emulsifiers in commercial white breads \u2014 which are added to make them softer and easier to eat \u2014 also cause them to be more quickly digested and absorbed, Fung noted.",
      "\"You can see the effect of this on the glycemic index, which measures how quickly bread spikes your glucose,\" he said.",
      "The GI is a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest glucose spikes. White bread has a very high GI of 73, Fung said, while machine-ground whole wheat is not much better, at 70.",

However, under a lesser-known initiative called the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), ARC collects and monetizes vast amounts of data from domestic flight bookings. This includes names, complete itineraries and payment details.",
      "Internal government records and procurement documents reveal that Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has purchased access to ARC's TIP data to track individuals of interest across the U.S. While CBP maintains that this data supports criminal and administrative investigations, critics argue that the arrangement raises major privacy concerns.",
      "The data is shared without travelers' knowledge or consent, and ARC reportedly requested that the agency keep its identity confidential unless legally required to disclose it.",
      "The documents confirm that CBP\u2019s initial contract with ARC began in June 2024. It has already been extended and may continue through 2029. Although the initial amounts seem modest, around $11,000 with a recent $6,800 update, the implications are far-reaching.",
      "Passengers traveling on an airplane\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What DHS is collecting from your flight bookings and why it\u2019s concerning",
      "ARC\u2019s Travel Intelligence Program goes far beyond basic passenger manifests. It includes over a billion records spanning both past and future travel, updated daily. The system can be queried by name, credit card or even travel agency. Importantly, it does not include data from tickets purchased directly through airline websites, focusing instead on bookings made via travel agencies, such as Expedia.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The DHS has justified its use of TIP data in a public Privacy Impact Assessment, noting the program helps in active investigations. CBP echoed this, stating that data is only used when a case is already open. Still, this sets a dangerous precedent. It normalizes mass surveillance through third-party data purchases, undermining safeguards designed to limit unnecessary intrusion.",
      "This isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement also acknowledged purchasing ARC data. Other federal agencies listed in procurement records include the Secret Service, SEC, DEA, TSA and even the Air Force.",

      "6 ways you can protect your privacy from data brokers",
      "If you want to take back control of your personal information, here are six smart steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure to data brokers.",
      "1. Book flights directly on airline websites:\u00a0Whenever you can, avoid using third-party travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz or travel agencies. These platforms are the main sources of the data collected by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) through its Travel Intelligence Program. When you book directly on an airline\u2019s official website or mobile app, your data is far less likely to be shared with ARC or sold to government agencies. While it might be tempting to look for deals on aggregator sites, once you find a fare you like, try to book it directly through the airline.",
      "2. Use virtual or disposable credit cards:\u00a0The ARC system allows queries by credit card number, which means your travel activity can be tracked even if your name is not directly searched. To protect yourself, consider using a virtual credit card or a disposable card number for flight bookings. These are often available through banking apps or fintech services like Revolut, Privacy.com or certain American Express accounts. Virtual cards are tied to your main account but generate a temporary number that can only be used once or at a specific merchant. This makes it much harder for brokers to link future bookings to you.",
      "3. Share the bare minimum when booking:\u00a0Be cautious about the personal information you enter during the booking process. Unless it is legally required, avoid adding unnecessary details like your frequent flyer number, passport data for domestic flights or secondary phone numbers. You can also create a separate email address specifically for travel bookings to reduce the risk of cross-linking data with your other online accounts. When it comes to loyalty programs, consider opting out or using a separate identity if you are concerned about data being shared across companies.",
      "4. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete",
      "5. Use a privacy-focused browser and email service: Prevent tracking at the source by using privacy-first tools. Switch to browsers like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo, which block ads and data collectors by default. Set up a separate, secure alias email address for booking travel using services. This limits how easily brokers can link your travel data to your online identity. See my review of the best secure and private email services by\u00a0visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail",
      "6. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0If your travel or payment data is ever leaked or abused, freezing your credit can help prevent identity theft. Identity theft companies can assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. They can also monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.",
      "One of the best parts of my No. 1 pick is that is it has identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ARC incident is yet another example of federal agencies bypassing traditional legal channels by buying sensitive data from private firms. Travelers are not just passengers, they are data points in a growing ecosystem where information is currency. The fact that this trade happened without informed consent and behind legal smokescreens should worry anyone who values privacy.",

      "That smile logo you may see next to Amazon\u2019s name in your inbox isn\u2019t just for show. It is part of a larger verification system designed to help customers distinguish between real emails and scams.",
      "In an interview with CyberGuy, Amazon\u2019s VP of Worldwide Buyer Risk Prevention explained:",
      "\"We\u2019ve made it harder for bad actors to impersonate Amazon communications through implementing industry-leading tools, including the adoption of a secure email capability to make it easier for customers to identify authentic emails from Amazon and avoid phishing attempts. Customers using Gmail, Yahoo!, and other common email providers can be confident that when they receive an @amazon.com email with the smile logo in their inbox, that email is really from us.\"",
      "The smile icon now appears next to verified @amazon.com emails in inboxes like Gmail, Yahoo, and Apple Mail. It is a quick visual cue that the email has passed Amazon\u2019s security checks and can be trusted.",

      "This system helps reduce guesswork, but it is not foolproof. If you ever doubt the legitimacy of a message, go directly to your Amazon Message Center. Any real communication from Amazon will be listed there.",
      "How to protect yourself from fake emails",
      "Even with Amazon rolling out new safeguards like verified sender logos and the Message Center, scammers are still targeting customers with sophisticated phishing emails. Here are the top ways to protect yourself:",
      "1. Know the signs of a scam: Fake Amazon emails often try to scare you or tempt you into clicking by using familiar tricks. You might see a message claiming your account has been locked, offering a gift card or refund, confirming an order you never placed, or asking you to verify payment details or login credentials. These tactics are meant to create urgency or curiosity. It\u2019s important to remember that Amazon will never ask for your password, banking information, or gift card codes by email.",
      "2. Double-check every message: If something feels off, don\u2019t click anything. Instead, visit Amazon.com or open the app to check your order history and account messages. If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats. This extra layer of security helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe. A few quick habits can go a long way in keeping your personal information secure.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:00:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "What is Meta AI, and what does the \"Discover\" tab do?",

      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast.

      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "A new threat targets both Android and iPhone users. (Apple)",
      "What is SparkKitty mobile malware",
      "Researchers at cybersecurity firm Kaspersky recently identified SparkKitty. This malware appears to succeed SparkCat, a campaign first reported earlier this year that used optical character recognition (OCR) to extract sensitive data from images, including crypto recovery phrases.",
      "SparkKitty goes even further than SparkCat. According to Kaspersky, SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. This tactic exposes not just wallet data but also any personal or sensitive photos stored on the device. While the main target seems to be crypto seed phrases, criminals could use other images for extortion or malicious purposes.",
      "Kaspersky researchers report that SparkKitty has operated since at least February 2024. Attackers distributed it through both official and unofficial channels, including Google Play and the Apple App Store.",
      "SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kaspersky found SparkKitty embedded in several apps, including one called \u5e01coin on iOS and another called SOEX on Android. Both apps are no longer available in their respective stores. SOEX, a messaging app with cryptocurrency-related features, reached more than 10,000 downloads from the Google Play Store before its removal.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles, often disguised as legitimate components. Once installed, SparkKitty uses a method native to Apple\u2019s Objective-C programming language to run as soon as the app launches. It checks the app\u2019s internal configuration files to decide whether to execute, then quietly starts monitoring the user\u2019s photo library.",
      "On Android, SparkKitty hides in apps written in Java or Kotlin and sometimes uses malicious Xposed or LSPosed modules. It activates when the app launches or after a specific screen opens. The malware then decrypts a configuration file from a remote server and begins uploading images, device metadata, and identifiers.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles. (Apple)",
      "Unlike traditional spyware, SparkKitty focuses on photos, especially those containing cryptocurrency recovery phrases, wallet screenshots, IDs, or sensitive documents. Instead of just monitoring activity, SparkKitty uploads images in bulk. This approach makes it easy for criminals to sift through and extract valuable personal data.",
      "1) Stick to trusted developers:\u00a0Avoid downloading obscure apps, especially if they have few reviews or downloads. Always check the developer's name and history before installing anything.",
      "2) Review app permissions:\u00a0Be cautious of apps that request access to your photos, messages, or files without a clear reason. If something feels off, deny the permission or uninstall the app.",
      "3) Keep your device updated:\u00a0Install system and security updates as soon as they are available. These updates often patch vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "4) Use mobile security software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious software is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Both Apple and Google removed the identified apps after being alerted, but questions remain about how SparkKitty bypassed their app review processes in the first place. As app stores grow, both in volume and complexity, the tools used to screen them will need to evolve at the same pace. Otherwise, incidents like this one will continue to slip through the cracks.",

      "Thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. \"Cyberguy\" Kurt Knutsson explains.",
      "When someone loses the ability to speak because of a neurological condition like ALS, the impact goes far beyond words. It touches every part of daily life, from sharing a joke with family to simply asking for help. Now, thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. This technology isn't just about converting thoughts into text. Instead, it translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "There's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. (UC Davis)",
      "Real-time speech through brain signals",
      "The heart of this system is four microelectrode arrays, surgically implanted in the part of the brain responsible for producing speech. These tiny devices pick up the neural activity that happens when someone tries to speak. The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

      "Why VenHub's model could change retail nationwide",
      "VenHub's model offers significant advantages that could reshape retail across the country. The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "The human factor: Are robots replacing jobs or creating new ones?",
      "A common concern with automation is the impact on jobs. VenHub's robots do replace some traditional retail roles, but the company emphasizes that new opportunities are emerging. Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",

      "VenHub smart store pricing and ownership: What you need to know",
      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance. With high demand and expanding production capacity, VenHub is working to deliver stores to new owners as quickly as possible across the country.",

It's interesting to consider that this kind of smart, connected retail experience could soon become something we all use every day, without even thinking twice about it.",

By preserving the historic Huayanli complex above ground while adding modern infrastructure below, Shanghai is finding a smart balance between honoring its heritage and embracing progress.",

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

One term you might be familiar with is software as a service (SaaS), a model by which software is accessed online through a subscription rather than installed on individual machines.",

The breach involved sensitive health information belonging to over 5 million people in the United States. The company first noticed suspicious system activity Feb. 6, 2025, but the actual compromise began ten days earlier.",

      "The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",
      "Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",

      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",

      "The magic behind\u00a0Kara Pod is its ability to extract moisture from the air, even if you live in a dry climate or keep your home air conditioned. The process starts when the device pulls in ambient air. Inside, advanced materials capture the water vapor in the air. That moisture is then heated to kill any microbes, and it passes through a dual-stage UV sterilization system and a carbon filter to remove impurities, bacteria and particles.",
      "Once the water is purified, the Kara Pod adds essential minerals like calcium, magnesium and sodium. This turns into healthy, mineral-rich water that is ready to drink or brew with. The device can make up to 3.2 liters, which is about a gallon, of premium alkaline water every day. This water is stored in an internal tank that is always kept topped up so you never have to worry about running out or refilling it yourself.",

The company's CEO has explained that the device cannot be used without the mineralizer because prolonged consumption of distilled water may not be suitable for your health.

She made it clear that if New York wants to keep fossil fuels in check and meet its climate goals, nuclear energy has to be part of the mix. The new plant is expected to generate at least one gigawatt of electricity, which is enough to power about a million homes.

The last few projects have been plagued by delays and massive cost overruns. There's a lot of hope that new designs, like small modular reactors, could make things faster and cheaper, but those technologies haven't been proven at scale just yet.",
      "Gov. Hochul pointed out that a lot of the hurdles are at the federal level. Getting the necessary permits and approvals can take years, and the process is anything but simple.

      "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order lifting most U.S. sanctions on Syria, in a move experts say reflects growing recognition inside the administration that Syria, long a battleground for Iranian influence and Islamist terror, may now offer the U.S. a rare opportunity to reclaim regional leverage, counter enemies, and support allies like Israel and Jordan.",
      "At a White House press briefing Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"This is another promise made and promise kept by this president,\" she said, referring to Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Syria\u2019s new transitional leader Ahmed al-Sharaa during a trip to Saudi Arabia. \"He\u2019s committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors.\"",
      "\"The sanctions did their job,\" David Schenker, former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs and now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"They were crippling by and large.

      "Javed Ali, former senior official at the National Security Council and professor at the University of Michigan, told Fox News Digital, \"It\u2019s a strategic calculation. A Syria that no longer hosts Iranian proxies, cooperates on counterterrorism, and integrates with Arab neighbors serves U.S. interests on every front.\"",
      "According to Schenker, Syria has taken steps the U.S. has long demanded: allowing inspections by the IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, sharing intelligence on ISIS, and cooperating with American liaison officers on counterterrorism. \"These groups have declared al-Sharaa an infidel. They themselves are being attacked by ISIS,\" he noted.",

      "For the U.S., the stakes extend far beyond sanctions relief. Schenker said a stable Syria focused on education and social services, rather than military buildup, would be far less fertile ground for ISIS or Iranian influence.",
      "Ali described the current moment as part of a broader Trump strategy: \"Now with Assad gone, it\u2019s another blow to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This creates an opportunity to coalesce the Sunni Arab states \u2013 either around the Abraham Accords or a growing anti-Iran coalition.\"",
      "The U.S. military still maintains a small but critical footprint in Syria \u2013 approximately 1,000 troops across three to four bases in the northeast \u2013 providing vital intelligence and rapid strike capability. \"That footprint has been one of our most important counterterrorism outposts,\" Ali said. \"We\u2019ve seen multiple targeted operations this year alone.\"",

      "TRUMP ASKS SYRIA TO JOIN ABRAHAM ACCORDS, NORMALIZE TIES WITH ISRAEL IN RETURN FOR SANCTIONS RELIEF",
      "He said, however, that deeper U.S.-Syrian cooperation could bring new complications. \"There\u2019s always a risk that as ties deepen, either the U.S. could reduce its presence \u2013 or al-Sharaa might ask us to scale back,\" Ali said. \"That could impact our ability to monitor jihadist activity or manage the tens of thousands of ISIS detainees still in camps guarded by SDF forces.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the diplomatic implications of Trump\u2019s move are drawing global attention. Syria\u2019s new leadership has publicly distanced itself from Iran, reportedly blocked Hezbollah weapon shipments, and dismantled multiple Iranian military posts across the country.",
      "\"The president is genuinely focused on expanding the Abraham Accords,\" said Schenker. \"He sees Syria as the next possible candidate.\"",
      "NSC spokesman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors. The President is empowering Syria\u2019s success by lifting sanctions on export controls while maintaining sanctions on terrorists and all other potential threats to the United States. The President made a promise to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting sanctions, and this President keeps his promises.\"",
      "A masked Islamic State terrorist holds the ISIS flag in 2015. (Pictures from History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Still, normalization with Israel remains politically fraught. Syria remains officially at war with the Jewish state, and while Sharaa has hinted at accepting the pre-1974 ceasefire lines, jihadist factions and Islamist groups within Syria remain staunchly opposed. \"There have already been reported assassination attempts on Sharaa,\" Schenker said. \"It\u2019s going to get harder if he moves from non-belligerency to full normalization.\"",
      "Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"Syria has always been an open wound in the center of the region \u2013 an engine of instability\u2026 But if it stabilizes now, it unlocks a path for broader regional integration. It connects Israel and Jordan to a more secure arc and reduces the need for heavy U.S. military involvement.\"",

      "\"Israel is responsible for one of the cruelest genocides in modern history,\" Albanese said when opening the session in Geneva on Thursday.

      "Once a fringe militia born of revolution, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has grown into the regime\u2019s most feared and powerful force. But according to Dr. Afshon Ostovar, a leading expert on Iran and author of \"Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards,\" said the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes in Iran may have permanently altered its trajectory.",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT A POST-AYATOLLAH IRAN COULD LOOK LIKE IF WAR WITH ISRAEL LEADS TO REGIME\u2019S FALL",

(AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"What the IRGC tried to achieve over the last 25 years is basically toast,\" Ostovar told Fox News Digital, \"Their campaign to build a military deterrent at home through missiles and nuclear enrichment, and to expand regionally through proxies, has essentially collapsed.\"",
      "Founded in the wake of the 1979 revolution, the IRGC was created to safeguard and spread the Islamic Republic\u2019s values \u2014 often through violence. Ostovar describes how its legitimacy evolved over time, initially drawn from the overthrow of the Shah, then the Iran-Iraq War, and later through the manufactured narrative of an eternal struggle with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Director of FDD's Iran Program Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital the IRGC\u2019s origin reflects a deep mistrust of Iran\u2019s traditional military, which had remained loyal to the Shah.",
      "\"The IRGC were created through efforts to collect pro-regime armed gangs called Komitehs. They enforced revolutionary edicts and developed a parallel and ideological military force due to clerical skepticism in the national army,\" he explained.",
      "People move past a large banner featuring portraits of slain leaders from Iran-aligned armed groups, including Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, in central Tehran, Iran, on May 1, 2025.\u00a0 (MOHAMMADALI NAJIB/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"The IRGC are tasked with preserving and defending the revolution in Iran,\" Taleblu said. \"That\u2019s one reason why the 1979 Islamic Revolution has not been tamed, nor has the regime\u2019s extremism lost any luster. If anything, terrorism and hostage-taking have continued.\"",
      "\"They created a boogeyman in the U.S. and Israel,\" Ostovar added. \"But today, that ideology no longer resonates with most Iranians. The majority want better relations with the West and are tired of the regime\u2019s isolationist stance.\"",
      "Today, the IRGC is deeply intertwined with the clerical elite. \"The IRGC and the clerical elite are partners in power, treating Iran as a springboard to export their revolution,\" Taleblu noted.",

      "Over the past year, Iran has suffered a series of strategic defeats: Hezbollah has been degraded in Lebanon, Hamas crippled in Gaza, Syria effectively lost, and Iranian military infrastructure \u2014 including nuclear and missile sites \u2014 destroyed in many cases by U.S. and Israeli strikes. Ostovar says these losses have decimated the IRGC\u2019s regional footprint and forced the regime to reevaluate its strategy.",
      "\"They can try to rebuild everything \u2014 but that would take too long and be too difficult,\" he said. \"More likely, we\u2019ll see them repress harder at home and lean on China and Russia to rebuild conventional military capabilities like air defense and advanced jets.\"",
      "Members of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. A large part of its work is to covertly operate outside of Iran. (Reuters)",
      "Internally, the IRGC\u2019s economic empire is also under growing strain. Sanctions, cyberattacks, and battlefield losses have made operations far more difficult. Ostovar said that foreign banks avoid any connection with Iran out of fear they may inadvertently deal with IRGC-linked entities, forcing the group to operate through front companies abroad. \"They\u2019ve lost a lot, and now they\u2019ll have to redirect their limited resources to rebuild. That\u2019s going to stretch them even thinner.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "Despite these pressures, both Ostovar and Taleblu agree that the IRGC is unlikely to turn against the regime. \"Much like the regime elite, the IRGC is at a crossroads,\" Taleblu said. \"They have lost much of their strategic brain trust, but are likely to remain loyal for a combination of ideological and material reasons \u2014 so long as the status quo doesn\u2019t change.\"",
      "Looking ahead, Iran may shift focus inward, relying more on domestic repression than on external terror. \"They can\u2019t get weapons into Gaza. They\u2019ve lost access to Lebanon. They may still attempt terrorism, but they\u2019ve failed repeatedly \u2014 especially against Israeli targets,\" Ostovar said. \"In contrast, repressing their own people is something they can do easily.\"",
      "He warns that Iran could become \"more insular, more autocratic \u2014 more like North Korea than what it is today.\" While regime collapse is always a possibility, Ostovar believes autocracies are often resilient. \"Look at Venezuela or Cuba \u2014 they\u2019ve run their countries into the ground but still hold on to power.\"",

      "Ostovar thinks change \u2014 and not for the better \u2014 could come via generational shift. \"The IRGC\u2019s younger cadre is less religious but no less hardline,\" he said. \"They may not care about hijabs, but they\u2019ve spent the last two decades fighting the U.S. and Israel in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. That\u2019s the war they know.\"",
      "Some reformist elements within the regime envision a different path \u2014 one focused on normalization and growth. \"They want to preserve the regime not by fighting the world, but by opening up to it,\" Ostovar said. \"They look more to Vietnam or China as models.\"",

      "During his speech, which kicked off just before 5 a.m., the Democratic leader slammed the GOP bill, often referencing a series of binders as he read notes from Americans who he said would be harmed by Medicaid and SNAP benefit cuts.",

      "Jeffries closed by referencing remarks by Martin Luther King Jr., who had urged people to \u201cpress on and keep pressing.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I take my seat, I just want to say to the American people that no matter what the outcome is on this singular day, we\u2019re going to press on,\u201d he said, going on to list more than a dozen groups he would \u201cpress on\u201d for.",
      "\u201cPress on for the left behind,\u201d he said, as lawmakers echoed his call. \u201cPress on for the rule of law. Press on for the American way of life. Press on for democracy. We\u2019re going to press on until victory is won. I yield back.\u201d",
      "The minority leader also referenced the 2026 midterms during his final minutes of the speech. He nodded to Republican goals in Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint, noting that the Declaration of Independence framers were \u201cfed up with Project 1775, and so they implemented Project 1776.\u201d",

      "Democrats repeatedly broke into resounding applause throughout Jeffries\u2019 speech, chanting his name and embracing him in hugs after he finished speaking.",
      "The minority leader zeroed in on the bill\u2019s impact on Medicaid recipients, reading notes from people who rely on government health care programs or have family on Medicaid.",
      "\u201cAbove all else, I\u2019m just thankful for the spirit, the heart and soul of the American people who have risen up throughout this country to make it clear to all of us in this institution: Keep your hands off our Medicaid. Keep your hands off our health care,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "The Senate version of the bill would lead to nearly 12 million people losing health insurance over the next 10 years because of Medicaid cuts, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would institute work requirements for able-bodied adults under 65 years old \u2014 a key Republican priority \u2014 and it would alter the way states fund Medicaid.",
      "The bill also includes huge funding increases for immigration enforcement and the military and would cut Biden-era clean energy tax credits, among other provisions.",

      "The minority leader also touched on other Democratic priorities, criticizing Trump's tariffs and the administration's handling of deportations.",
      "The White House criticized Jeffries' speech, arguing that he was \"bloviating\" to delay the bill's passage.",
      "\"He wants America to fail\u2014 but @POTUS will ensure America succeeds,\" said the White House's rapid response team in a post to X.",

      "A relatively underappreciated constituency is raising the alarm about President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 gamblers.",
      "Tucked into the nearly 900-page legislation is a change to how gambling losses are taxed that some professional and amateur bettors say could crush the industry.",
      "The provision, only a few paragraphs, would limit what gamblers can deduct from their yearly taxes to 90% of their losses starting in 2026. Currently, bettors can deduct the entirety of their losses, up until their winnings.",
      "What a number of gambling aficionados pointed out on social media was that by limiting the tax deduction to 90% of losses, gamblers could actually owe taxes in years where they netted a loss on their bets.",
      "\u201cThis new amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would end professional gambling in the US and hurt casual gamblers, too,\u201d Phil Galfond, a professional poker player, posted to X, including a video summarizing his argument. \u201cYou could pay more in tax than you won. Contact your representative quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump is set to sign the bill into law on Friday. The provision first generated buzz online after the Senate passed the legislation on Tuesday.",
      "One example given on X laid out that, under this new setup, if a gambler won $200,000 in a year but lost $210,000, they would actually  be able to deduct only $189,000 worth of losses. Meaning they\u2019d have $11,000 in taxable income even though they netted $10,000 in losses during the year.",
      "\u201cA pro who earns $200k/year might have $3m in winnings and $2.8m in losses,\u201d Galfond said in a subsequent tweet. \u201cThis means earning $200k and being taxed as if they earned $480k. This applies to both recreational and professional gamblers.\u201d",
      "Gambling revenues have reached record highs in recent years as legalized gambling has proliferated across the U.S. Thirty-eight states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, now have some form of legalized sports betting, which has exploded following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that broke up Nevada\u2019s monopoly on the practice. In 2024, commercial gaming revenue reached a record high of nearly $72 billion, according to the American Gaming Association, which represents the U.S. gambling industry.",
      "Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat who represents Las Vegas, tweeted Wednesday that she was already seeking to amend the change.",
      "\u201cBuried within the BS Republican Budget bill is a provision that harms poker players and those who gamble by limiting loss deductions,\u201d Titus wrote. \u201cI\u2019m working on a legislative fix that fairly treats gaming losses in the tax code.\u201d",
      "One gaming industry source who spoke with NBC News said the impact of the tax change is still to be determined, though this person said the change would mostly impact professional gamblers rather than recreational players.",
      "In a May 6 letter to the chairs and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways & Means Committee, William C. Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Industry, included maintaining the current deduction for wagering losses as one of three industry-specific tax priorities for the reconciliation package Republicans have advanced.",
      "Other priorities named in the letter, which was obtained by NBC News, included increasing the slot tax reporting threshold from $1,200 to $5,000 and repealing the sports betting excise tax on legal sports wagers. The AGA also named a number of broader tax priorities, including calling for no tax on tips and maintaining the current corporate tax rate and SALT deductions.",
      "In the letter, Miller described keeping the current gambling loss deduction as \u201ccritical,\u201d adding that it should be expanded to allow for taxpayers who do not itemize their returns to report their net wins and losses as part of their adjusted gross income.",
      "\u201cMaintaining this deduction at its existing levels was absolutely a priority for the legal, regulated gaming industry,\u201d the gaming industry source said. \u201cSo it\u2019s fair to say that with this specific provision, we\u2019re disappointed, and we\u2019ll be monitoring its impact and seeking to work with congressional leaders to fix this before the overall legislation takes effect at the end of this year.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. FanDuel and DraftKings, two of the biggest players in the sports betting market, declined to comment.",
      "\u201cTax code is already punitive to poker players (you get taxed on winning years but can\u2019t write off losing years unless you file as a pro; it\u2019s easy to have a down year even as a good player) and Senate-passed version of OBBBA would make it considerably worse,\u201d Nate Silver, the prominent political data analyst, tweeted.",
      "As gambling, particularly legalized sports betting, has proliferated in recent years, though, researchers have found a negative impact on bettors\u2019 finances, including reduced savings and lower investments in generally safer assets like stocks. Meanwhile, internet searches for gambling addiction and calls to state gambling helplines have increased, particularly with younger men."

      "The additional work from men is most apparent in food preparation and cleanup. Men spent an average of 16 minutes per day cooking in 2003 \u2014 that value has since jumped to 28 minutes.",

      "Cooking, along with other routine and frequent tasks such as house cleaning and laundry, is referred to as \u201ccore\u201d housework, which has traditionally been seen as feminine.",
      "The shift in men\u2019s work, largely concentrated in cooking and cleaning, has been particularly pronounced since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic."

Ron DeSantis that federal money would be used to operate the controversial Everglades immigrant detention center, the state has so far received \u201cno federal funds,\u201d  according to court documents filed Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "In filings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, DHS officials said that the facility has relied only on state funding so far and that Florida has not yet applied for federal funding.",
      "\u201cFlorida has received no federal funds, nor has it applied for federal funds related to the temporary detention center,\u201d it reads. \u201cCourts cannot adjudicate hypothetical future funding decisions or render advisory opinions on contingent scenarios that never materialize.\u201d",
      "The filing was the agency\u2019s response to a lawsuit filed by two environmental groups asking that the facility be shuttered. DHS argued it has no such authority because the department has not \u201cimplemented, authorized, directed, or funded Florida\u2019s temporary detention center.\u201d",
      "The facility, dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d gained national attention even ahead of its opening Tuesday. Trump and some of his top administration officials joined state officials for a tour of the facility, and the president said he\u2019d like to see similar facilities constructed in other states. It is expected to cost $450 million a year to operate, according to Florida officials.",
      "During the event, Trump said the federal government was not just going to help reimburse the state for costs, but that it also helped with construction \u2014 which was done in just eight days under the authority of an emergency immigration order DeSantis signed in 2023 and has extended several times since then.",
      "Trump pointed to the source of the funds as the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Shelter and Services Program, which has been used in the past to house undocumented people. During President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, the same pot of money was used to house undocumented people, a point Trump and other Republicans have long criticized, at times baselessly, as spending taxpayer dollars to house undocumented migrants in \u201cluxury\u201d hotels in New York City.",
      "\u201cWe took the FEMA money that Joe Biden allocated to pay for the free luxury hotel rooms where he\u2019s paying hundreds of millions of dollars in New York City, and we used it to build this project\u201d Trump said.",
      "Last week, DeSantis also told reporters that the facility will be \u201cfunded largely\u201d by the FEMA program.",
      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz will be funded largely by FEMA\u2019s Shelter and Services Program, which the Biden administration used as a piggy bank to spend hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars to house illegal aliens,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it is being used to detain criminal illegal aliens while they await deportation.\u201d",
      "DHS on Thursday said the federal government will still use the FEMA funds to pay \u201cin large part\u201d for the facility.",
      "\u201cThese new facilities will in large part be funded by FEMA\u2019s Shelter and Services Program, which the Biden Administration used as a piggy bank to spend hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars to house illegal aliens,\u201d DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.",
      "The Shelter and Services Program is a reimbursement-based program, which means states must apply for reimbursements related to eligible costs. The facility has been open for fewer than three days, so the issue could center on Florida just not yet applying for the FEMA funds because of the early work.",
      "The Florida Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Florida Department of Emergency Management, the agency responsible for applying for reimbursements, did not return requests seeking clarification.",
      "The admission that no federal funding has yet been sent to the state comes amid behind-the-scenes tension between top DHS officials, including Secretary Kristi Noem, and DeSantis over the governor\u2019s handling of the facility\u2019s rollout. Federal officials wanted the main unveiling to coincide with Trump\u2019s visit Tuesday, but DeSantis did a tour of the facility with \u201cFox and Friends\u201d last Friday, something that caught both federal and some state officials off guard.",
      "DHS called the claims \u201cfake news\u201d when NBC News first reported the tensions Tuesday but did not refute the claims.",
      "\u201cDeSantis upset Noem and Lewandowski with his Fox News tour of the detention site,\u201d a Republican operative familiar with the process told NBC News on Tuesday, referring to Corey Lewandowski, Noem\u2019s close adviser. \u201cNoem wanted an event for Tuesday and didn\u2019t want anyone having eyes on the site and needed to push until Tuesday because she was traveling.\u201d",

Our message to any cartel affiliates in the U.S. is clear: We will find you and you will face consequences. The days of unchecked cartel violence are over.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Just ahead of the long Independence Day weekend, beaches across the country have closed and issued advisories because of  excessive levels of harmful bacteria. The culprit is fecal waste, a common summer problem in both freshwater and oceans that can cause gastrointestinal illness and skin infections.",
      "At least six states have issued closures or advisories for certain beaches and lakes that have tested positive for above safe levels of fecal bacteria. In Massachusetts, almost two dozen beaches are closed due to excessive bacteria levels. Four beaches in New York are closed. Illinois has issued at least eight advisories in the past few weeks. Los Angeles County had released eight ocean water quality advisories as of Tuesday. Michigan has closed three beaches.",
      "The bacteria causing havoc for summer swimmers include E.coli and Enterococcus \u2014 nasty germs often found in the feces of people and animals. The contamination can occur because of sewage, manure or storm runoff. E.coli is more likely to be found in freshwater, whereas enterococcus can form in both marine and freshwater.",
      "Edward Dudley, director of the E. Coli Reference Center at Pennsylvania State University, said testing bodies of water used for swimming is routine and common, as are closures.",
      "Beach closures are more likely around the summer months, when ocean surface temperatures are high and bacteria can grow more easily, said Antarpreet Jutla, associate professor of environmental engineering sciences at the University of Florida. However, a variety of factors \u2014 including human activity, temperature and water movement \u2014 can affect bacterial growth, he said.",
      "Jutla also said that beach closures due to fecal bacteria are very common.",
      "In North Carolina, officials warned about cyanobacteria algae blooms in Lake Norman, urging people to keep children and pets away from water that appears bright green, blue or scummy.  Different from fecal bacteria, cyanobacteria are the most common cause of algae blooms in freshwater, such as lakes or rivers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research suggests that climate change may be triggering cyanobacterial algae blooms more frequently.",
      "Although the Environmental Protection Agency sets guidelines on safe levels of fecal bacteria, states can set their own water quality and monitoring standards. Some, such as Illinois, test public beaches every two weeks.",
      "\u201cI would say, the higher the levels, probably the higher the risk,\u201d Dudley said.",
      "While fecal waste can lead to many harmful diseases, experts are worried by recent increasing levels of another harmful bacteria: vibrio.",
      "Vibrio is a potentially deadly bacteria that has caused similar beach closures in recent years. The flesh-eating bug thrives in warm, coastal waters. Jutla, who researches vibrio bacteria, has seen vibrio gradually migrate north across the United State. Testing for vibrio depends on each state as well as its concentration limits, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing right now with increasing trends in the entire country, but that\u2019s something that we are really concerned about \u2014 what is going to be present in the coastal waters,\u201d Jutla said about vibrio.",
      "The deadly V. vulnificus is a rare type of the bacteria, but infections have been growing in recent years as it follows warming ocean water up the eastern coast of the U.S."

    "summary": "The Nuggets and Rockets have improved their rosters in free agency while the Lakers and Bucks have made head-scratching moves.",
    "story": [
      "Blink and you might have missed the Oklahoma City Thunder's coronation as NBA champions last week.",
      "Barely 24 hours after the Thunder's title parade capped the 2024-25 season, the 2025-26 offseason got underway with the NBA draft. That was followed Monday with the official opening of free agency.",
      "Free agency isn't the league-altering bonanza it was once because, instead of taking meetings with suitors as an unrestricted free agent on the open market, superstars now instead follow the trend of taking long-term, lucrative contract extensions.",
      "Yet the offseason is still where championships can be won and lost. Look no further than Oklahoma City, whose title run was aided by the acquisitions of Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein a  year earlier.",
      "NBC News is here to break down the major stories and signings of free agency so far.",
      "What was the best move of free agency so far?",
      "Nadkarni: The Denver Nuggets trading Michael Porter Jr. and an unprotected 2032 first-round pick to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson was something of a triple whammy. First, it allowed the Nuggets to get off of Porter Jr.\u2019s massive salary, which was complicating how the team could build the roster. Second, Johnson is going to be a great fit in Denver. He\u2019s a better defender than Porter Jr., and he\u2019s a more versatile offensive player while still being a great shooter. And lastly, the Nuggets immediately took advantage of the newfound flexibility of Johnson\u2019s cheaper contract to add more veteran pieces to the rotation. Without making the Porter Jr. trade, Denver may have been stuck all summer.",
      "Greif: Though Houston ended last season with the West\u2019s second-best record, that seed didn\u2019t scare anybody entering the postseason; the Rockets were too inexperienced and untested and lost in the first round. Ever since, they\u2019ve acquired Kevin Durant for pennies on the dollar, added free agent Dorian Finney-Smith \u2014 a signing that weakens his former team, the Lakers \u2014 re-signed young talents in Jabari Smith Jr. and Jae\u2019Sean Tate and also Steven Adams, their revitalized big man, and retained guard Fred VanVleet on a team-friendly extension.",
      "All of it positions the Rockets to be legitimately the second-best team in the West next season behind Oklahoma City. In many ways, how Houston has approached this offseason reminds me exactly of Oklahoma City did last year at this time. Coming off a promising regular season in which they vaulted to the top of the West, the Thunder lost earlier than expected in the playoffs and used that information about what went wrong to smartly add their missing pieces. No one\u2019s saying next season will end with a title as this season did for the Thunder, but this offseason has put Houston legitimately in the conversation.",
      "What was the biggest head-scratching move?",
      "Nadkarni: There is only one correct answer here, and that\u2019s the Milwaukee Bucks waiving and stretching Damian Lillard\u2019s contract, meaning the Bucks will pay roughly $22.6 million over the next five seasons for Lillard not to be on the team. We\u2019ve literally never seen a team stretch a contract this big before, and the ramifications \u2014 while ultimately unclear \u2014 will be felt for the rest of the decade.",
      "As a runner-up, though, I\u2019ll add in the entire New Orleans Pelicans offseason. For some reason they traded away C.J. McCollum\u2019s expiring deal for an extra year of Jordan Poole while also dealing away a very valuable 2026 first-round pick to move up for Maryland big man Derik Queen. I have no clue what this team thinks it is or what it wants to be.",
      "Greif: Milwaukee\u2019s decision to waive injured guard Damian Lillard in order to make room for former Pacers center Myles Turner. Reasonable people can conclude that the All-Star pairing of Lillard and big man Giannis Antetokounmpo had not worked as expected. Yet to move on, the Bucks chose a route that makes it very difficult to upgrade their roster in the future \u2014 $22 million of their salary cap for the next five years will go to Lillard, a player not even on their roster \u2014 all without much of a guarantee it will turn them into title contenders in the present. Turner is younger than Brook Lopez, the outgoing Bucks center who left for the Los Angeles Clippers, but underwhelmed during the NBA Finals with Indiana. The ultimate goal, of course, for Milwaukee is keeping Antetokounmpo happy enough that the franchise cornerstone doesn\u2019t demand a trade. We\u2019ll see by next season\u2019s trade deadline how happy he truly is.",
      "Which team has been the biggest winner?",
      "Nadkarni: What the Hawks have done under new general manager Onsi Saleh has been remarkable. With Trae Young in the final year of his contract before a playoff option, Saleh has surrounded him with arguably the best talent of his career. Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard were brought in to join Dyson Daniels and Jalen Johnson in the wing rotation, giving Atlanta head coach Quin Snyder a ton of optionality for his lineups this season. Need more defense? Play Johnson, Daniels and NAW together. Need more shooting? Put Kennard on the floor along with center Kristaps Porzingis, who was acquired via trade from Boston.",
      "Porzingis could really take this team to another level if he stays healthy. With Onyeka Okongwu still in the mix, Porzingis should not have to carry a major load during the regular season. This is a really well-constructed team. If anyone can go on a Pacers-like run, it\u2019s the Hawks.",

      "Liverpool soccer star Diogo Jota killed in car crash in Spain, police say",
      "Cuban women\u2019s volleyball team denied U.S. visa to compete in Puerto Rico",
      "Greif: The honor of most impressive offseason so far is a tie between Denver and Atlanta. Both teams are under new front-office management and both are going for it. The Nuggets' ownership doesn't have a free-spending reputation, so kudos to allowing their new basketball operations leadership to build around all-world superstar Nikola Jokic in his prime by bringing back Bruce Brown, a critical piece of their 2023 championship roster, and trading Michael Porter Jr. for Cam Johnson.",
      "In a depleted Eastern Conference that feels up for grabs after superstar injuries derailed Indiana and Boston\u2019s title ambitions next season, Atlanta is quietly positioning itself to become a contender. Nickeil Alexander-Walker adds a dependable ballhandler with playoff experience. Luke Kennard is one of the NBA\u2019s best shooters when playing with confidence, and if the Hawks\u2019 coaching staff can get him to not pass up shots, his one-year deal is a steal. The high-risk, high-reward wild card is former Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis, who is coming off a mysterious ailment. Less than a year ago, Atlanta felt on the verge of blowing up its roster and giving up on Trae Young as a cornerstone. Now, it\u2019s oriented its whole roster around Young. Let\u2019s see what happens.",
      "Which team has been the biggest loser?",
      "Nadkarni: What are the Los Angeles Lakers doing? Sometimes it feels this team has been moderately successful the last few seasons in spite of their front office, which is routinely gifted star players and then makes baffling roster decisions.",
      "The Lakers lost Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency, and haven\u2019t replaced him on the wing. Finney-Smith played with Luka Doncic in Dallas, and is the exact type of 3-and-D wing who can succeed off Luka and LeBron James. So that\u2019s a big hole on the roster.",
      "And to address the center position, Los Angeles is rolling the dice on Deandre Ayton, who has been inconsistent at best the last three seasons, and at worst a teammate whom multiple franchises couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of. That\u2019s the guy who is supposed to get Doncic to stay and inspire confidence in a 40-year-old James?",
      "The Lakers have Luka and LeBron, yet it feels they aren\u2019t close to the top of the West.",
      "Greif: The Los Angeles Lakers. This was a team that, late last season, looked as though it had a puncher\u2019s chance in the West. Since getting beaten in the opening round by Minnesota, they\u2019ve watched Oklahoma City gain confidence and a championship, stood by idly in free agency as contenders Houston and Denver get deeper and more dangerous, all while losing Dorian Finney-Smith, a key rotation piece during the playoffs.",
      "Though the Lakers finally added a center, they did so while becoming the latest team to pray that center Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 draft, fulfills the potential that went unrealized previously in Phoenix and Portland. Much of the optimism around the Lakers last season came from the pairing of LeBron James, who was still playing at an all-NBA level 22 seasons into his career, with Luka Doncic. But after James opted into the final year of his contract with a statement from his agent that raised speculation about how badly James wants to be a Laker this season, how long will that core duo stay together?",
      "Is there a move you want to see?",
      "Nadkarni: I want to see the Pacers do...something. The last couple weeks have been devastating for Indiana. Star Tyrese Haliburton tears his Achilles in Game 7 of the Finals, and then the team lost center Myles Turner to the rival Bucks \u2014 in part because the Pacers didn\u2019t want to pay up for their longest tenured player.",
      "Taking something of a gap year kind of makes sense for Indiana. But after that magical run in the playoffs, Pacers fans deserve a little something to hang their hat on this summer. Though it\u2019s wise for Indiana not to make a big swing, I hope the team finds a way to make its upcoming season a little more interesting in the wake of what\u2019s happened with Haliburton and Turner.",
      "Greif: Chris Paul landing with a team that has a shot at contention. While it has been nice to see Paul, who turned 40, seemingly embrace mentorship this late in his career \u2014 having helped a young Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in Oklahoma City in 2020, then Victor Wembanyama last season in San Antonio \u2014 it\u2019s not because he\u2019s become some rotational afterthought. Last season, he played all 82 games and can still hit that elbow jumper automatically.",
      "Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see his cutthroat competitiveness in play on a contender again? The question is how far from Los Angeles, where his family lives, he would be willing to go to chase a ring."

    "summary": "The Republican-controlled House passed a multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and spending package, sending the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-controlled House on Thursday passed a multitrillion-dollar package of tax cuts and spending, sending the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk after a tense 24 hours of negotiations and arm-twisting.",
      "The mostly party-line vote of 218-214 came one day ahead of Trump\u2019s July 4 deadline and caps an arduous process that lasted more than four months, rife with ideological clashes and acrimony between the House and Senate, where Republicans had little margin for error given their narrow majorities.",
      "In the end, the GOP largely unified to pack the bulk of Trump\u2019s domestic agenda into a single measure, with just Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., voting against it. A bloc of Republican holdouts had initially opposed a procedural vote Wednesday to advance the bill, leading to an hourslong overnight standoff. But Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., managed to sway all but one of them, teeing up final passage in the House.",
      "Trump is now expected to sign the bill into law on Independence Day, marking the party\u2019s biggest legislative accomplishment since taking full control of Washington in January.",
      "The 887-page package , dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" extends the tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay. It approves hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation plans. And it partially pays for all that with steep cuts to Medicaid, food aid benefits and clean energy funding. That includes an estimated $930 billion in spending reductions under Medicaid, violating Trump's promise not to cut the program.",
      "Overall, the bill is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over a decade, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finding that the revenue losses of $4.5 trillion outstrip the spending cuts of $1.2 trillion. The bill also increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Throughout the process, Republican leaders had an ace in the hole to corral the votes even as the competing demands of rival factions appeared irreconcilable: They knew their members wouldn\u2019t ultimately say no to Trump, from the most conservative to the least ideological and politically vulnerable.",
      "\u201cRepublicans in Congress have succeeded in our mission to enact President Trump\u2019s America First agenda,\u201d Johnson said in joint statement with his leadership team. \u201cAnd importantly, we did it in record time, so that the effects of this nation-shaping legislation can be felt by the American people as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Republicans often turned to Trump throughout the process to help close the deal on key votes. He regularly held meetings with and made phone calls with key lawmakers, while issuing the occasional threat on Truth Social to holdouts who stood in the bill\u2019s way. Vice President JD Vance was also a regular presence in Senate and House meetings around the bill.",
      "\u201cIf President Trump and Vice President Vance had not engaged at the time they did, it wouldn\u2019t have passed,\u201d said conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who attended White House meetings in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room on Wednesday and ultimately voted for the bill.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the wee hours of the morning, Johnson said Trump had been making phone calls to recalcitrant holdouts as late as 1 a.m. Thursday to help break an impasse on the floor.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really sleep a lot,\u201d said Johnson, who also dangled the prospect of future bills to address concerns and demands from a variety of members.",
      "In his 1 a.m. call with holdouts, Trump and other White House officials made promises to aggressively implement key provisions in the bill \u2014 from clean energy tax credit phase outs to new Medicaid restrictions, a source familiar with the call said.",
      "One by one, the GOP critics folded and accepted demands they insisted they wouldn\u2019t. Conservatives swallowed a bill that adds trillions to the debt. Politically vulnerable Republicans endorsed steep cuts to Medicaid and health care spending that are projected by CBO to cost 11.8 million people their insurance. Republicans whose districts and states benefit from clean energy incentives ended up voting to strip them away.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just afraid of Trump and the backlash that would ensue if he called them out,\u201d Massie, who opposed the bill, told NBC News the day before the final vote. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump and his allies sought to strike fear in GOP lawmakers by vowing to support a primary challenger to Massie in his next election. Massie, who objected to the large deficit increase in the bill, said Trump\u2019s real goal was to keep other Republicans in line by sending a message that defying him comes with political pain.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re whipping this horse, because I\u2019m out of the barn, to keep the other horses in the barn,\u201d he said.",
      "Fitzpatrick, who represents a swing district, said the steeper Medicaid cuts, \u201cin addition to several other Senate provisions,\u201d moved him from supporting an earlier version of the bill to opposing the final one.",
      "\u201cI believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\u201d",
      "Later, on the 1 a.m. call with Trump, Massie remarked how it'd be nice if Trump stopped attacking him, the source said, then flipped from no to yes on the key procedural vote.",
      "The House took up the bill after the Senate voted 51-50 to pass the legislation on Tuesday, with Vance breaking the tie. The only Republicans who voted against it were Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Thom Tillis, R-N.C. and Susan Collins, R-Maine. The party used the filibuster-proof \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d process to get around the 60-vote threshold, which meant that some non-budgetary provisions were stripped out.",
      "Every Democrat in both chambers voted against the bill, blasting it as a tax cut for the wealthy that is paid for by cutting programs like Medicaid that benefit the working class. They plan to place a heavy focus on the bill in their message to voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, emboldened by polls showing that the legislation is unpopular.",
      "At the start of a record-breaking floor speech Thursday morning that lasted for 8 hours and 44 minutes, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., ripped what he called the \u201cbig, ugly bill, this disgusting abomination,\u201d and accused Republicans of working through the night to pass it because it would kick millions of Americans off Medicaid and food stamps. Republicans argued that work requirements would target waste, fraud and abuse in those programs.",
      "\u201cWhy did debate begin at 3:28 a.m. in the morning?\u201d Jeffries asked with House Democrats filling the seats behind him. \u201cRepublicans are once again, which has been the case, Mr. Speaker, through every step of this journey, trying to jam this bill through the House of Representatives under cover of darkness.\u201d",
      "Republicans began making plans for their reconciliation package even before last year\u2019s presidential election. In March 2024, House Republicans huddled at their annual retreat, at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, to brainstorm what should be included in the bill so they'd be better prepared than in 2017.",
      "But after Republicans took unified control of the White House and Congress in January, fissures in the party quickly began to emerge. Senate leaders pushed to carry out Trump\u2019s agenda in two separate bills, before the president endorsed the House approach of passing his agenda in \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d which eventually became the title of the legislation.",
      "Along the way, all 53 Senate Republicans voted to set a novel precedent by using a budget trick known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201d that treats $3.8 trillion in Trump tax cut extensions as costing $0, in order to avoid satisfying Senate rules requiring that they be paid for. Democrats said it was akin to the \u201cnuclear option\u201d will weaken the 60-vote threshold going forward.",
      "Still, Democrats did get a jab at Trump in the process: They deleted the title, \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d by successfully arguing that the name wasn\u2019t budgetary in nature. The legislation\u2019s official title is instead, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14.\u201d"

      "Trump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday came only days before the 90-day suspension of the steep tariffs he proposed in April expires next week, and as his administration scrambles to strike agreements with dozens of trading partners. Even so, he did not say when the deal with Vietnam would take effect, or whether both sides have agreed to the tariff rates.",
      "In the months between Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff rollout and his announcement on Wednesday, retail executives in the apparel and footwear industries fretted over the potential that Vietnam imports could face tariffs nearly as high as the cumulative 55% duties for Chinese imports.",
      "Over the last decade, some of America\u2019s top retailers, including Gap, American Eagle and Nike, have all reduced their reliance on China to shield themselves from both high tariffs and the region\u2019s geopolitical turbulence.",
      "Many sought refuge in Vietnam, where the factories, some owned by Chinese businesses, are known to produce products at a similar quality and price as China. They also started manufacturing in other countries in southeast Asia, such as Cambodia, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Cambodia was facing tariffs of 49%, Bangladesh 37% and Malaysia 24% under Trump\u2019s April plan, but are subject to a 10% duty for now.",
      "Vietnam is now the second-largest supplier of footwear, apparel and accessories sold into the U.S. market, according to the industry trade group the American Apparel & Footwear Association. It has become an essential part of the footwear supply chain, on pace to become the largest supplier of shoes to the U.S. in 2025, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, another industry trade group.",
      "If Trump\u2019s proposed 46% tariff on Vietnam had taken effect, it would mean much of the industry\u2019s work to leave China would have been for naught. Some companies are relieved the tentative deal would set the levy at 20% and the announcement agreement is also a sign that Cambodia, Malaysia and Bangladesh could reach similar frameworks.",
      "\u201cTwenty percent is a sigh of relief,\u201d said Sonia Lapinsky, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners who advises fashion brands. \u201cThere\u2019s some positivity and some optimism that this is manageable. So at least there\u2019s that. This isn\u2019t business destroying, which is great. However, this does have real implications, right?\u201d",
      "Most companies have plenty of tools to offset the impact of tariffs, such as working with their suppliers to share costs. But to avoid major hits to their profit margins, many including Nike are planning to raise prices. It\u2019s still unclear how those hikes will affect consumer spending because it will take time for the increases to trickle down in the supply chain.",
      "AlixPartners previously created pricing models for CNBC that examined how the price of Vietnamese-made sweaters and shoes could rise under Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs \u2014 if retailers do not pass any of the cost on to suppliers or shoppers. At a 10% levy, the cost of a $95 pair of men\u2019s shoes could rise by $7.42 to $102.42. With a 20% duty in place, the cost increase would be even larger.",
      "Many executives worry any tariff hike of this magnitude will be bad for businesses and consumers. Paul Cosaro, the CEO of Picnic Time, a supplier to top retailers like Target, Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, said if the clocks were wound back to April and Trump said there\u2019d be a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, \u201cno one would\u2019ve been happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere could be threats of a 46% tariff and you come back with 20 and it\u2019s going to sound better but\u2026 it\u2019s just more money coming out of the consumers\u2019 pockets at the end of the day and they have less money to spend on picnic baskets and coolers and things like that,\u201d said Cosaro, who raised his prices between 11% and 14% earlier this year to offset the cost of China tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not good for the consumer. Ultimately, it\u2019s just increasing the prices \u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good news.\u201d",

      "The interstellar comet was first spotted Tuesday by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The NASA-funded survey telescope \u2014 which is actually made up of two telescopes in Hawaii, one in Chile and a fourth in South Africa \u2014 is designed to scan the entire sky several times each night, searching for asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth.",
      "Researchers combed through archival data from three different ATLAS telescopes and the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in California, and they found corresponding observations that helped confirm the discovery. Other telescopes around the world also joined the effort, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cESA\u2019s Planetary Defenders are observing the object, provisionally known as #A11pl3Z, right now using telescopes around the world,\u201d the European Space Agency said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "The comet is about 420 million miles away, moving quickly from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, NASA said in a blog post about the discovery. Sagittarius is a prominent constellation in the Southern Hemisphere that points toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy.",
      "The agency said 3I/ATLAS will swing closest to the sun around Oct. 30, passing at a distance of approximately 130 million miles, or just inside the orbit of Mars.",
      "NASA said the comet should be visible to ground-based observatories through September, allowing time for scientists to glean additional details about the cosmic interloper, including its size. After September, 3I/ATLAS will be too close to the sun to observe with telescopes, but the object is expected to be visible again in early December, when it emerges on the other side of the sun.",
      "The months ahead offer a rare opportunity to study a celestial tourist from beyond our solar system. The first confirmed interstellar object seen passing through the solar system was discovered in 2017 by the University of Hawaii\u2019s Pan-STARRS1 telescope. The rocky object, named \u2018Oumuamua (Hawaiian for \u201ca messenger from afar arriving first\u201d), has a reddish hue and is elongated like a cigar, according to NASA.",

      "Michael Madsen, the gravel-voiced character actor best known for playing sneering tough guys in Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2,\" died Thursday morning from cardiac arrest, according to his manager, Ron Smith.",
      "He was 67.",
      "In an acting career spanning more than 40 years, Madsen racked up dozens of screen roles. But he was best known for his collaborations with Tarantino, who cast him as a psychotic thief in \"Reservoir Dogs\" and a washed-up hitman in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2.\"",
      "\"Reservoir Dogs,\" one of the seminal independent films of the 1990s, shocked audiences with its graphic violence, including a  scene in which Madsen's character, Mr. Blonde, cuts off a police officer's ear while dancing to \"Stuck in the Middle With You.\"",
      "Madsen's other notable big-screen credits include \"The Doors,\" \"Thelma & Louise,\" and \"Donnie Brasco.\" Tarantino included him in the ensemble casts of the bloody Western \"The Hateful Eight\" and the 1969-set \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"",
      "In addition to film and television projects, Madsen played voice roles in video games such as \"Grand Theft Auto III,\" the \"Dishonored\" series, and \"Crime Boss: Rockay City.\" He also published poetry and photography.",
      "Michael Madsen was born in Chicago on Sept. 25, 1957, to a firefighter father and filmmaker mother; one of his siblings is the Oscar-nominated actor Virginia Madsen.",
      "He got his professional start working at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where he apprenticed under John Malkovich. The experience led to small early roles in 1980s films like \"WarGames\" and \"The Natural.\"",
      "Madsen eventually broke through with \"Reservoir Dogs,\" a low-budget crime thriller that launched Tarantino's career and helped transform the Sundance Film Festival into a Hollywood hotspot.",
      "The film also earned Madsen an indelible place in film history. The sadistic and trigger-happy Mr. Blonde was one of the 400 nominees for the American Film Institute's list of the all-time greatest movie villains.",
      "Roger Ebert praised Madsen's performance in an otherwise mixed review of \"Reservoir Dogs.\"",
      "\"One of the discoveries in the movie is Madsen, who has done a lot of acting over the years ... but here emerges with the kind of really menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve; he can hold his own with the fearsome Tierney, and reminds me a little of a very mean Robert De Niro,\" Ebert wrote in his review.",
      "Madsen was originally lined up to play John Travolta's role in Tarantino's era-defining \"Pulp Fiction,\" though he dropped out to appear in Kevin Costner's \"Wyatt Earp\" instead \u2014 a choice he said he came to regret.",
      "Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\" allowed Madsen to flex his dramatic muscles as Budd, a former elite assassin who eventually finds himself working as a low-rent bouncer and living in a trailer.",
      "He worked steadily throughout his career, acting in various small-scale projects but occasionally appearing in high-profile releases, such as the James Bond franchise entry \"Die Another Day\" and the graphic novel adaptation \"Sin City.\"",
      "Madsen was married three times, most recently to DeAnna Morgan. He is survived by four children, including actor Christian Madsen; another son, Hudson, died in 2022."

So I\u2019m glad that we walked away from this, no longer together,\u201d Marita explains. \u201cAnd now I get to be a pivotal moment to people that you should never settle.

      "\u201cI was honestly so inspired by Britney. I love how passionate she is about what she does and how much of a bad--- she is, being the CEO of her own company.  You can tell she cares so much for the people in her life, from her family to her friends to AJ. Her genuine kindness and caring just radiates from her,\" she says.",
      "Marita became empowered by the way Britney cared and displayed love.",
      "\u201cIf this person energetically can give me this much love, light and energy, then there will be someone out there that can do that for me. And that\u2019s not Ashley because I\u2019m just simply not seeing that with her. I\u2019m not seeing the effort. I don\u2019t need it and I can move on,\" she says."

      "CBS has announced a few twists that \u201cBig Brother\u201d fans can expect to see when the show returns for Season 27, including one that even surprised host Julie Chen Moonves.",
      "On July 2, ahead of the long-running summer competition show\u2019s premiere on Thursday, July 10, CBS shared first-look images of the newly designed \u201cBig Brother\u201d house and revealed the theme for the season: \u201cA Summer of Mystery.\u201d",
      "In a press release, the network teased that the houseguests will soon move into \u201cHotel Myst\u00e8re, a place where secrets lurk behind every door and nothing is as it seems.\u201d",
      "What does that mean? Well, CBS explained that the season premiere will include \u201cunexpected twists and turns including a masked visitor, a secret accomplice and the shocking arrival of a \u2018Mystery Houseguest\u2019 whose identity will remain under wraps \u2026 at least for now.\u201d",
      "The 90-minute premiere kicks off at 8 p.m. ET/PT and will be followed by another extended episode on Sunday, July 13, at the same time.",
      "So, who is this \u201cMystery Houseguest\u201d who will impact the game? Chen Moonves recently spoke about the new season and how the twists will reflect the show\u2019s \u201cexpect the unexpected\u201d motto that fans love.",
      "In an Entertainment Weekly interview published July 3, the host said the mystery houseguest will be a \u201cpolarizing\u201d figure who viewers will surely have an opinion about.",
      "\u201cWhat I can say is the mystery houseguest, when I was told who this person is, I had to expect the unexpected! I never expected that person,\u201d Chen Moonves shared. \u201cAnd I was very excited because, in my opinion, getting that person is epic. And that person is also very polarizing. So there\u2019s going to be a strong reaction in both directions for this mystery houseguest.\u201d",
      "As for the secret accomplice, Moonves revealed that the person will be required to complete certain tasks.",
      "She said, \u201cThe accomplice this person\u2019s going to have \u2014 they\u2019re going to have responsibilities, and they may or may not be able to pull it off, and that will affect the game.\u201d",
      "The host described the masked visitor as a more \u201cdisruptive\u201d version of the AI Bot A.I.N.S.L.E.Y. who took over last season.",
      "\u201cAinsley could do only so much, but this masked visitor is going to wreak havoc in ways that we\u2019ve never seen before. And I would say on a deeper level. Much deeper. It\u2019s more three dimensional,\u201d she teased.",
      "Speaking of Season 26, Moonves suggested that the AI Arena, which allowed three nominees to compete for another chance at safety on eviction night, could return this year.",
      "\u201cYeah, I was a huge fan of it, as was everyone internally. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but last summer it worked so well, so we extended it. Because it wasn\u2019t supposed to go on for as long as it did,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason I liked it so much is because at the beginning of each season, there tends to be this herd mentality where there\u2019s no surprise on eviction night because the whole house goes one way.\u201d",
      "Moonves added, \u201cSo things that work well tend to make an appearance again. I mean, look at the Power of Veto. That became a staple after Season 3. So I would say it\u2019s like shaking the Magic 8 Ball \u2014 signs are pointing to yes.\u201d",
      "She also said the mystery theme will affect the houseguests and viewers at home. For instance, the host explained that some items in the house might appear ordinary but will play a role in how the game unfolds this season.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a detective this year to play this game,\u201d she advised the Season 27 houseguests.",
      "Following the format of previous seasons, \u201cBig Brother\u201d is expected to reveal its Season 27 cast a few days before the premiere."

      "Oasis' tour starts with a pair of shows in Cardiff, Wales, on Friday, July 4, and Saturday, July 5.",
      "When Are Oasis\u2019 North America Tour Dates?",
      "Oasis is scheduled to perform in only five North American cities during its tour, beginning in Toronto. It will also visit Chicago; East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York City; Los Angeles; and Mexico City.",

Ticketmaster\u2019s website shows no available tickets for any of the U.S. tour dates. A search on the popular resale sites SeatGeek and StubHub shows that a ticket will cost you over $100 at minimum, depending on the city and date.",
      "What Will the Oasis Tour Songs List Be?",
      "There isn't an answer to that question yet, but if you believe the internet speculation, the band will lean heavily into its first two albums, 1994's \u201cDefinitely Maybe\u201d and 1995's \u201c(What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory?\u201d That would make sense, given that Oasis\u2019 biggest hits came from those albums.",
      "Ticket holders are surely hoping the Gallaghers will incorporate some mix of \u201cLive Forever,\u201d \u201cSupersonic\u201d and \u201cCigarettes & Alcohol\u201d (from \u201cDefinitely Maybe\u201d), plus \u201cWonderwall,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back in Anger\u201d and \u201cChampagne Supernova\u201d (from \u201cMorning Glory\u201d), into their set list.",
      "Oasis also has a strong catalog of B-sides, so favorites like \u201cAcquiesce,\u201d \u201cThe Masterplan\u201d and others would please longtime fans as well."

      "Three seasons later, \"Squid Game\" has ended. Was protagonist Gi-Hun's (Lee Jung-jae) fate spelled out in Season 1, Episode 1? The evidence is convincing, fans are saying online.",
      "In the hit Netflix show out of South Korea, financially desperate people battle each other for a prize pot of 4.56 billion won, or just over $33 million.",
      "After winning the first game in Season 1, Gi-hun returns, this time with the intention to take down the craven competition. He makes it to the end again. In the final moments, he chooses between sparing himself and taking the life of an infant born during the games, or leaving the infant as the sole winner.",
      "The words he says are a clue into his journey in the show.",
      "How do Gi-hun's last words tie back to Episode 1?",
      "In a dramatic, intense moment, Gi-hun turns to Front Man and the VIPs, who spectated the final game, and makes his thoughts clear.",
      "\u201cWe are not horses. We are humans. Humans are\u2026\u201d Gi-hun says as his voice trails off.",
      "He never finishes the sentence. Instead, he plunges to his death, leaving the infant as the winner of the game.",
      "Some fans pointed out that this was a nod to the very first episode of the TV series, when viewers learned about Gi-hun\u2019s life outside of the game.",
      "Gi-hun is depicted as a financially struggling divorced dad who loves his daughter dearly. To celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday, he wanted to treat her to dinner and a nice present but didn\u2019t have the money. He turns to horse betting to win money for his daughter.",
      "The horse betting motif carries all throughout the show. Similar to horse races, the \"Squid Game\" players participate for the enjoyment of the bettors and VIPs. Despite mental torture and never-ending trauma, the bettors do not care; they simply want to be entertained.",
      "This motif is mentioned by Front Man \u2014 a former winner-turned \"Squid Game\" exec \u2014 in the first season, moments before Gi-hun is dropped off on the street with the prize money on a debit card.",
      "\u201cYou bet on horses?\u201d Front Man asks Gi-hun, who is seen blindfolded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same here, but we bet on humans. You\u2019re our horses,\u201d Front Man continues.",
      "Though it may not be what they wanted, fans say that Gi-hun\u2019s fate is a full circle moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of saying that we shouldn\u2019t forget that what we\u2019re watching is disgusting, and that maybe we should think about why we\u2019re watching this kind of entertainment,\u201d said one commenter on TikTok.",
      "\u201cHorses act on instinct. They\u2019re forced into wars, into races, into someone else\u2019s game. They run because they don\u2019t have a choice. And maybe that\u2019s what the Squid Game was, people running out of desperation,\u201d another X user said.",
      "What do his last words mean?",
      "Show director Hwang Dong-hyuk spoke to Variety about Gi-hun\u2019s last words and why he never finishes the sentence.",
      "\u201cMore and more I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s so difficult to define what humans are. We are very complex beings,\u201d Hwang said.",

      "While it seems like this incident is something that could only be imagined, it was a reality for over 3,000 unlucky passengers and over 1,000 crew members.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What happened on the Carnival Triumph?",
      "In February 2014, 4,200 passengers and crew members were stuck at sea aboard the Carnival Triumph.",
      "The cruise was meant to follow a four-day roundtrip route from Galveston, Texas to Cozumel, Mexico.",
      "However, on the fourth day of the cruise, a power outage left the boat floating in the middle of the ocean, waiting to be tugged to land, NBC News reported at the time.",
      "While the ship was first going to be taken to Mexico, strong winds carried the boat so far north in the Gulf it had to be taken to Mobile, Alabama, instead.",
      "The conditions on board were harrowing, as reported by passengers interviewed at the time. With no electricity on the ship, passengers took to sleeping on the ship\u2019s deck to escape their hot rooms and used sheets to create makeshift tents on deck.",
      "Conditions on board were already difficult without electricity. Add to the mix that ship's plumbing also halted.",
      "\u201cThe worst part is the bathrooms,\u201d passenger Donna Gutzman told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s no water. You can\u2019t really flush so everyone\u2019s going in little plastic baggies and putting it outside their rooms.\u201d",
      "The ship eventually returned to land on Feb. 14.",
      "Why did the power go out?",
      "The cruise ship lost power after an engine room fire. After the ship's return, the Coast Guard concluded that a fuel oil return line leak sprayed onto a hot surface in the room, starting a flame, NBC News reported.",
      "The U.S. Coast Guard Marine Casualty Investigation Team said the ship\u2019s crew \u201cdid a very good job\u201d in responding to the fire.",
      "The damage was caused to a small area of the engine room, but because the oil burned at such a large temperature, the room had to be closed off. Crew members were not able to set out the blaze immediately.",
      "This fire created a domino effect that cut out the ship\u2019s power and halted its toilets.",
      "NBC News later reported that Carnival knew about the risk of leaks from engine fuel hoses, according to court documents surfaced in a lawsuit later filed against the corporation on behalf of dozens of the ship\u2019s passengers.",
      "Carnival said, in a response, that the ship\u2019s engines passed inspection before departure.",
      "What did people say about their experiences?",
      "Passengers on the Carnival Triumph spoke about how what was meant to be a vacation turned into a nightmare.",
      "Wondering what a ship holding thousands of people without working plumbing smells like? One person compared the conditions of the sewage-soaked ship to a zoo, NBC News reported.",
      "Clark Jones, one of the ship's passengers, told NBC News at the time that he saw people hoarding food and protecting their turf on ship. Jones said recounted the conditions as \u201cprimitive.\u201d",
      "Another passenger on the ship, Julie Billings, told NBC News that the experience \u201cwas like post-natural disaster, but stuck on a boat with 3,200 other people, and those poor workers trying to clean up after everyone and deal with everyone freaking out.\u201d",
      "As the ship made its way to dock in Mobile, NBC News reported people chanting to be let off and using bed sheets to make giant sigs spelling out \u201cSOS!\u201d or \u201cSweet Home Alabama!\u201d",
      "NBC News also reported that passengers were grateful for the crew\u2019s response to the unprecedented experience. Janie Baker told MSNBC at the time that the crew was \u201cfantastic,\u201d despite the tempers of those on board \u201cflying\u201d by the final night.",
      "Though not all were satisfied. \u201cIt was mistake after mistake after mistake, incompetence to a point I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d passenger Mark Mazan said on TODAY.",

      "As passengers made it back on dry land, NBC News reported that former Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Gerry Cahill apologized for the ordeal.",
      "\u201cWe pride ourselves on providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,\u201d Cahill said at the time.",

Other passengers joined the lawsuit, which was settled out of court in 2016.",

      "\"It'd be Billy Murray singing 'Star Wars' or Eddie Murphy doing 'Hot Tub,' even the Debbie Downer, womp, womp, womp, womp,\" he says, adding Debbie Downer sound effects for good measure.",

      "\"Jurassic World's\" breakout star tucks into a backpack and chomps on licorice with her tiny teeth. Her name is Dolores, and she\u2019s quickly become the soft spot of \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d",
      "When the film made its theatrical debut on July 2, audiences encountered a dinosaur not yet seen before in the franchise: an Aquilops, brought to life not only by special effects but also by an animatronic figure.",
      "In the six previous entries of the \u201cJurassic\u201d franchise, moviegoers learned to brace for colossal carnivores, bone-rattling reptile rumbles and bloody-slicked jungle terrain. But Dolores' big eyes and playful energy likens her more to a pet than a predator.",
      "In a June 26 behind-the-scenes featurette, actor Rupert Friend, who portrays Martin Krebs, described Dolores as \u201cadorable,\u201d adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite character in the film. She's probably mine.\"",
      "Similar affection for the dinosaur was extended when she appeared on TODAY June 25 alongside co-star Scarlett Johansson, who goaded co-anchor Craig Melvin into giving her a kiss.",
      "\"She's a diva,\" Johansson gushed, adding. \"Give Dolores a kiss!\"",
      "She might be an animatronic, but she certainly appeared real enough to Craig, who hesitated several times before finally plopping a kiss on her head.",
      "\"She is sweet, not as sweet as you,\" Craig told Johansson.",
      "What Kind of Dinosaur Is Dolores?",
      "Dolores is an Aquilops who made her feature debut in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d She strikes a connection with the film\u2019s character Isabella (played by Audrina Miranda), whom the dinosaur comforts when Isabella is frightened.",
      "\u201cThe reason why our relationship is so good in the movie is because I was scared and she just happened to crawl along and help me,\u201d explains Miranda in the behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "Isabella eventually learns that Dolores isn\u2019t like the dangerous teeth-gnashing dinosaurs on the island. Instead, Dolores enjoys licorice and is up for being carried around in Isabella\u2019s backpack.",
      "David Iacono, who portrays Xavier in the film, describes her in the featurette as a \u201cfun-loving puppy.\u201d",
      "How Big Was Aquilops?",
      "When Aquilops, who inspired Dolores, existed more than 100 million years ago, it was believed to be nearly two feet long according to the Sam Noble Museum at the University of Oklahoma. Or, roughly the size of a small cat!",
      "How Was Dolores Brought to Life in \u2018Jurassic World Rebirth\u2019?",
      "Instead of being created solely through CGI, special effects artists brought Dolores to life in an animatronic form, according to NBC Insider. The Dolores puppet was operated via radio controllers, capable of making the dinosaur blink and move her head, body, jaw and tail.",
      "As a result, Dolores didn't just feel real on screen. According to the film\u2019s director, Gareth Edwards, Dolores' cuteness factor meant it was hard to tear the cast and crew away from her.",
      "\"The days we had the Aquilops on set were very long days because people wouldn't go home,\" Edwards explains. \"They would stop and they'd want to pet her.\""

      "In 2024, Kelce took on his first \"serious\" acting role as Eddie Lachlan in Ryan Murphy's show \u201cGrotesquerie.\u201d While he credited the \"really good cast\" for showing him the ropes, he said he felt out of his comfort zone \"preparation wise.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so prepared for an NFL game,\u201d Kelce explained. \u201cIn my career field, I get an entire week to figure out a scheme, how I\u2019m going to attack somebody, how I\u2019m going to handle certain specific situations. And when you go into acting, it\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t feel as prepared.\u201d",
      "The Super Bowl champion says he wishes acting had a similar approach to his on-field plays, saying, \u201cEvery single director I\u2019ve met on scenes, I\u2019m just like, \u2018Coach me up. I\u2019m here to be coached. If I suck, tell me I suck. Tell me how I can be better. I\u2019ll take all the criticism, I don\u2019t give a f---.\u2019\u201d"

      "The documentary details Mariska Hargitay's journey toward learning more about her mother, examining her feelings about her mother's fame and discovering that Mickey Hargitay was not her biological father. The film reveals that Italian singer Nelson Sardelli is her biological father, which she did not learn until she was 25 years old.",

      "Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Bear\u201d Season 4.",
      "So, did Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and the rest of the crew get that Michelin star, or what? Well, the answer, like all things \u201cThe Bear,\u201d is equal parts heartwarming, soul-stirring and frustratingly chaotic.",
      "Before Season 4 dropped, Tina (Lisa Col\u00f3n-Zayas) visited TODAY with Jenna and Friends and said that the season goes \u201cmuch deeper\u201d with the themes of \u201cpersonal responsibility and reckoning,\u201d guaranteeing more of the show\u2019s heightened restaurant-kitchen anxiety that is now a trademark of the show.",
      "\u201cDoomsday could be coming,\u201d she said in a spoiler-free preview, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is, because I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d",
      "On June 25, all 10 episodes of Season 4 dropped on Hulu/FX, and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve binged every moment in rapid succession, much like sandwich orders coming through the gang\u2019s long-abandoned ticket machine.",
      "Now we know what Col\u00f3n-Zayas meant: the future could be doomsday, or it could be exactly what all of our characters \u2014 especially Carmine \u201cCarmy\u201d Berzatto \u2014  need to survive and finally thrive.",
      "We\u2019ve reached the end of another season full of marinara and mayhem, and here\u2019s where our main players stand after Episode 10, \u201cGoodbye.\u201d",
      "Sydney now knows Carmy\u2019s plans",
      "The episode opens on Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) resting her head against a fence in obvious frustration behind the restaurant. The following half hour and change is what is called a bottle episode, in that it unfolds on one set. Just like the tension that follows, the entire episode stews in this alleyway amongst the dumpsters.",
      "Carmy enters and notes that Syd has pretty much ignored him all night.",
      "\u201cYou good?\u201d Carmy asks. (No, she is not good.)",
      "At the end of Episode 9, after we find out Marcus has won Best New Chef from Food and Wine, Sydney finally found out from Pete (Chris Witaske) the exact terms of the updated partnership agreement she has avoided signing this season. Carmy wants to sign away his ownership of the restaurant, turning over The Bear to Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt), Natalie \u201cSugar\u201d (Abby Elliott) and Syd.",
      "As one would expect, Syd feels blind-sided, particularly after choosing her love for The Bear over her partnership with Adam Shapiro in Episode 8. Now, she\u2019s ready to hash things out with Carmy.",
      "Yes, Carmy does actually want to leave The Bear",
      "It seems almost unbelievable that, after all this effort and at such a crucial time for the health of this very family-oriented business, that the restaurant's main driving Berzatto would want to leave, but there have been clues into Carmy's intentions all season.",
      "First is Carmy\u2019s actual efforts to heal some wounds, especially with Claire (Molly Gordon), his on-and-off (and maybe on again) girlfriend he fell out with thanks to a locked walk-in \u2014 and truly cruel admission \u2014 at the end of Season 2. He\u2019s also timidly starting talking to his mother Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis) again.",
      "Also, he\u2019s seemed distant all season long; changes to the menu that would normally set this character on a roller coaster of screams and epithets were met with an eerie calm.",
      "When he had no notes for Syd\u2019s scallop dish, it felt like his work mentoring her was done \u2014 but neither her nor the audience picked up on it until now.",
      "Sydney and Carmy fight over The Bear's future",
      "\u201cCan I actually just not hear you talk for one f---ing second?\u201d Syd says as she attempts to smoke a cigarette, something our white t-shirted hero points out she does not usually do. She takes a trembling drag anyway.",
      "Carmy tries to explain his thinking behind leaving the restaurant. First, he plans on staying on until the restaurant is financially viable, something it is very much isn\u2019t at this juncture.",
      "Nearly 1,440 hours \u2014 or two months \u2014 have passed on the clock Uncle Jimmy set up to show when he would stop funneling money into the restaurant, leading its employees to subsist solely on profit, which we\u2019ve repeatedly been shown does not exist.",
      "The chaos \u2014 both in action and the recently-shelved chaos menu of old \u2014 has led to the debt, in Carmy\u2019s opinion.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to draw on, I don\u2019t have anything to pull from,\u201d Carmy says. \u201cI was trying to put hurdles in the way.\u201d",
      "Syd lists many of the issues Carmy has: tensions with family, shaky mental health, non-existent stress management, anger issues and more, and he fully agrees with her. Carmy also reveals that he knew Syd was considering leaving for Shapiro\u2019s new venture, but says he understands that, too, because of all of his issues.",
      "Carmy thinks Syd, with her natural leadership, love of cuisine and her empathy, is the true future of the restaurant and she finally begins to see where he\u2019s coming from, at least a little bit.",
      "\u201cI believe in you more than I\u2019ve ever believed in myself,\u201d he says, and she asks why. \u201cBecause you\u2019re The Bear.\u201d",
      "The conversation devolves into screaming once again when Carmy says that Syd doesn\u2019t need him.",
      "\u201cI know I don\u2019t need you but that\u2019s not the point,\u201d Syd says through tears at someone she considers her partner. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be here.\u201d",
      "Richie joins the argument and gets a promotion",
      "Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) hears all the shouting outside and enters the scene. He misunderstands when Syd says Carmy is leaving at first, just thinking he\u2019s leaving early after closing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s leaving the f---ing restaurant,\u201d Syd clarifies.",
      "Richie is shocked at Carmy \u201cretiring,\u201d saying he\u2019s \u201cf---ing 12,\u201d and accusing him of being on drugs. This whole season, Richie has been dealing with his feelings about belonging: his acceptance of another father figure in his young daughter\u2019s life, mistakes he\u2019s made at work and his efforts to grow.",
      "They fight and Carmy blurts out that he went to his brother Mikey\u2019s (Jon Bernthal) funeral \u2014 everyone thought he had skipped it, but the audience found out that he did when Uncle Lee (Bob Odenkirk) said he saw him earlier in the season.",
      "Carmy and Richie have a heart to heart: Richie thought Carmy wasn\u2019t at the funeral out of anger and resentment at him for not figuring Mikey out. Carmy says that he was actually jealous of Richie and Mikey\u2019s relationship.",
      "\u201cYou were like, inside my family,\u201d Carmy says.",
      "Richie also admits he resented Carmy for his abilities, even disclosing that he purchased a fine dining cookbook, \u201cThe French Laundry\u201d written by Season 3 cameo\u2019s Thomas Keller. Carmy is impressed, even though Richie calls the book \u201cdemented,\u201d and after a beat, the main reason of this shocking departure is succinctly explained.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m like, Richie,\u201d Carmy says. \u201cLike, outside of the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Richie becomes part owner of The Bear and Sugar gets read in",
      "Sydney finally agrees to Carmy\u2019s terms, but has one addition: that Richie also becomes part owner of The Bear.",
      "\u201cUpdated partnership terms,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cOne side Jimmy, and the other side me, Nat and Richie.\u201d",
      "Richie doesn\u2019t believe it at first, thinking it was just a kind gesture, but Syd is serious, saying it\u2019s what she needs and Carmy accepts the update to the updated terms.",
      "\u201cF--- yes, Chef Sydney, it is a f---ing honor,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my official capacity as partner, I do have one question though, how the f--- do we keep this place open?\u201d",
      "Sugar then enters, and Richie tells her that Carmy went to Mikey\u2019s funeral. Rather than yell like everyone else, she wordlessly hugs her brother, bursting into tears. Cut to the empty restaurant, where the clock ticks away to zero.",
      "It\u2019s been an emotional rollercoaster with these four, who all delivered performances in this episode we'll likely see clipped come next Emmy awards season.",
      "FX has renewed \"The Bear\" for a fifth season, so Syd, Carmy, Richie and Sugar will leave that alleyway soon enough toward an uncertain future. Just like our sweet, swearing and sweaty faves, though, we\u2019re just going to have to live in tension until those episodes drop."

    "story": [
      "The second season of \u201cThe Ultimatum: Queer Love\u201d has come to a conclusion, with six couples deciding whether or not to move forward with their relationships.",
      "As of the July 2 finale, which of the Season 2 couples got engaged? Which split up? How many are still together as of the reunion, set a year following Ultimatum Day?",
      "Read on to learn more the current relationship status of all the contestants from\u201cThe Ultimatum: Queer Love\u201d Season 2.",
      "AJ Blount and Britney Thompson",
      "What happened on the show? Britney gave AJ an ultimatum. She believed that AJ was not interested in marriage because she felt that AJ was not getting as much attention as her business. Through her trial marriage to Marita, Britney learned work-life balance. In the reunion, AJ also shared that Marita told her that Britney would always choose her before her career. By Ultimatum Day, the two were the first to get engaged.",
      "Relationship status: AJ and Britney are still together and madly in love. AJ also stepped up her engagement game too, getting Britney a shinier ring than the one she proposed with Ultimatum Day. They don\u2019t have a set wedding date yet. Since then, they also spend time with Dayna and Magan, and Marita.",
      "Haley Drexler and Pilar Dizon",
      "What happened on the show? Haley gave Pilar the ultimatum after they had been together for more than a decade. When Haley and Magan were paired for their trial marriages, one of Pilar\u2019s greatest fears came true: they had a very close and personal bond and declared their love for one another. Haley and Pilar reconvened during the changeover, and Pilar told Haley to follow her heart. Haley ultimately embraced Pilar, saying their time during the changeover felt like a real marriage. Pilar popped the question and the two became engaged.",
      "Relationship status: Haley and Pilar are still engaged. \u201cShe was dying to get a ring on her finger also. So I told her within the next year I would make sure that I made it a priority to get down on one knee,\u201d Haley shared in the reunion.  \u201cAnd I did it less than a month later.",
      "While wedding dates aren\u2019t set, they intend to elope. \u201cI better be on it,\u201d AJ said.",
      "Kyle Neal and Bridget Matloff",
      "What happened on the show? The ultimatum came from Kyle, who was ready to settle down. Bridget, meanwhile, said she \u201cnever really understood the point of marriage.\u201d During her trial marriage with Pilar, Kyle worked through her communication issues. Meanwhile, Bridget learned that marriage is about choosing someone that you\u2019re willing to change with. On Ultimatum Day, Bridget popped the question, and Kyle accepted.",
      "Relationship status: The two are still happily engaged. During the reunion, Kyle\u2019s mother recorded a video message in which she made a reference to a \"Wicked\" song to say how Kyle has been \u201cchanged for good.\u201d",
      "Mel Vitale and Marie Robertson",
      "What happened on the show? Marie issued Mel an ultimatum as after four years together. The two shared a food truck business together and Marie was ready to settle down. Mel was put through a trial marriage with Dayna. The two became very close and got matching tattoos by the end of their experience. But this put Mel\u2019s relationship with Marie at a crossroads. By Ultimatum Day, Mel proposed and Marie accepted.",
      "Relationship status: As of the reunion, Marie and Mel are not together. \u201c\u2018With Marie\u2019 is nonexistent. Period,\u201d Mel said when host JoAnna Garcia Swisher asked about their relationship. Marie broke up with Mel a couple of months after the Ultimatum experience. Their food truck business also became Mel\u2019s.",
      "Dayna Mathews and Magan Mourad",
      "What happened on the show? Dayna gave Magan the ultimatum as she was ready to tie the knot. However, Magan was anxious about having to come out to her family, a dealbreaker for Dayna. In Magan\u2019s trial marriage with Haley, the two shared a close bond and even hooked up several times. The same also goes for Dayna and Mel. During the changeover, they had a number of arguments based on their emotionally turbulent trial marriages. The two soon made up and got engaged.",
      "Relationship status: Dayna and Magan are still engaged. Dayna experienced feelings of guilt as she reflected on her behavior and apologized to Marie. A number of adorable engagement photos and videos, including one of the couple hanging out with AJ and Britney on her birthday, were shared. Similar to every other engaged couple, they haven\u2019t decided when to tie the knot.",
      "Magan has finally included Dayna in her family life. \u201cShe actually came around for Thanksgiving last year,\u201d Magan shared tearfully. \u201cI never really brought anyone home for Thanksgiving before.\u201d They\u2019re now planning for both Dayna and Magan\u2019s parents to meet soon.",
      "Marita Prodger and Ashley Johnson",
      "What happened on the show: Ashley issued the ultimatum to Marita. In her trial marriage with Britney, Marita made the most of their time together, as they shared a deep connection. During her trial marriage, it seemed that what Marita needed was romance. Marita said Britney showed her the affection and romance that Ashley never could.",
      "Relationship status: On Ultimatum Day, Ashley broke it off with Marita. As of the reunion, they are still broken up. During the reunion, Ashley revealed that they traveled to Key West after the breakup. But Marita shared that Ashley tried to get her to the Keys because \u201cnone of the show mattered. All of that was for show.\u201d",
      "The two fought at the reunion and things got heated. Marita told Ashley she hated her and Ashley got up and walked away, sobbing. Mel went off-screen to help Ashley come down. Britney also gave Marita a hug in support. When she came back, Marita apologized, saying it would take time to reconcile."

      "BEERSHEBA, Israel \u2014 American contractors guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished.",
      "They said their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. One contractor said bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit.",
      "\u201cThere are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly,\u201d the contractor said.",
      "He said American staff on the sites monitor those coming to seek food and document anyone considered \u201csuspicious.\u201d He said they share such information with the Israeli military.",
      "Videos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites show hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets, stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray.",
      "Other videos include conversation between English-speaking men discussing how to disperse crowds and encouraging each other after bursts of gunfire. NBC News has not obtained or reviewed the videos.",
      "The testimonies from the contractors \u2014 combined with the videos, internal reports and text messages obtained by the AP \u2014 offer a rare glimpse inside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strip\u2019s population. Last month, the U.S. government pledged $30 million for the group to continue operations \u2014 the first known U.S. donation to the group, whose other funding sources remain opaque.",
      "In a statement issued in response to the AP\u2019s report, GHF said they had launched an investigation, which included reviewing the videos, and concluded that the claims in the story are \u201ccategorically false,\u201d and questioned the credibility of the reporting. The organization added that they are pursuing legal action against the news outlet.",
      "Journalists have been unable to access the GHF sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones. The AP and NBC News cannot independently verify the contractors\u2019 stories.",
      "On Wednesday, officials in Switzerland initiated proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal shortcomings in its establishment, Reuters reported.",
      "The group is registered in the U.S. state of Delaware and had registered an affiliate in Geneva on February 12. The Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA), a Swiss regulatory body, told Reuters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account.",
      "\u201cGHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out activities in Switzerland...and that it intends to dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),\u201d the ESA said in a statement obtained by Reuters.",
      "A spokesperson for Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP that there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. In scattered incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. That happened in the early days at the \u201cthe height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the 21-month war, Israel has bombarded and laid siege to the strip, leaving many teetering on the edge of famine, according to food security experts.",
      "For 2 1/2 months before GHF\u2019s opening in May, Israel blocked all food, water and medicine from entering Gaza, claiming Hamas was stealing the aid being transported under a preexisting system coordinated by the United Nations. It now wants GHF to replace that U.N. system. The U.N. says its Gaza aid operations do not involve armed guards.",
      "Over 57,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the war erupted, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants.",
      "GHF is an American organization, registered in Delaware and established in February to distribute humanitarian aid during the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis. Since the GHF sites began operating more than a month ago, Palestinians say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points, through Israeli military zones. Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and witnesses.",
      "In response, Israel\u2019s military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says it\u2019s examining how to reduce \u201cfriction with the population\u201d in the areas surrounding the distribution centers.",
      "AP\u2019s reporting for this article focuses on what is happening at the sites themselves. Palestinians arriving at the sites say they are caught between Israeli and American fire, said the contractor who shared videos with the AP.",
      "\u201cWe have come here to get food for our families. We have nothing,\u201d he recounted Palestinians telling him. \u201cWhy does the [Israeli] army shoot at us? Why do you shoot at us?\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the GHF said there are people with a \u201cvested interest\u201d in seeing it fail and are willing to do or say almost anything to make that happen. The spokesperson said the team is composed of seasoned humanitarian, logistics and security professionals with deep experience on the ground. The group says it has distributed the equivalent of more than 50 million meals in Gaza in its food boxes of staples.",
      "GHF says that it has consistently shown compassionate engagement with the people of Gaza.",
      "Throughout the war, aid distribution has been marred by chaos. Gangs have looted trucks of aid traveling to distribution centers and mobs of desperate people have also offloaded trucks before they\u2019ve reached their destination. Earlier this month, at least 51 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded while waiting for the U.N. and commercial trucks to enter the territory, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and a local hospital. Israel\u2019s military acknowledged several casualties as soldiers opened fire on the approaching crowd and said authorities would investigate.",
      "AP spoke to the two contractors for UG Solutions, an American outfit subcontracted to hire security personnel for the distribution sites. They said bullets, stun grenades and pepper spray were used at nearly every distribution, even if there was no threat.",
      "Videos of aid being dispensed at the sites seen by the AP appear to back up the frenetic scenes the contractors described. The footage was taken within the first two weeks of its distributions \u2014 about halfway into the operations.",
      "In one video, what appear to be heavily armed American security contractors at one of the sites in Gaza discuss how to disperse Palestinians nearby. One is heard saying he has arranged for a \u201cshow of force\u201d by Israeli tanks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be too aggressive,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause this is calming down.\u201d",
      "At that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots. \u201cWhoo! Whoo!\u201d one contractor yelps.",
      "\u201cI think you hit one,\u201d one says.",
      "Then comes a shout: \u201cHell, yeah, boy!\u201d",
      "The camera\u2019s view is obscured by a large dirt mound.",
      "The contractor who took the video told AP that he saw other contractors shooting in the direction of Palestinians who had just collected their food and were departing. The men shot both from a tower above the site and from atop the mound, he said. The shooting began because contractors wanted to disperse the crowd, he said, but it was unclear why they continued shooting as people were walking away.",
      "The camera does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at. But the contractor who filmed it said he watched another contractor fire at the Palestinians and then saw a man about 60 yards (meters) away \u2014 in the same direction where the bullets were fired \u2014 drop to the ground.",
      "This happened at the same time the men were heard talking \u2014 effectively egging each other on, he said. In other videos furnished by the contractor, men in grey uniforms \u2014 colleagues, he said \u2014 can be seen trying to clear Palestinians who are squeezed into a narrow, fenced-in passage leading to one of the centers. The men fire pepper spray and throw stun grenades that detonate amid the crowd. The sound of gunfire can be heard. The contractor who took the video said the security personnel usually fire at the ground near the crowds or from nearby towers over their heads.",
      "During a single distribution in June, contractors used 37 stun grenades, 27 rubber-and-smoke \u201cscat shell\u201d projectiles and 60 cans of pepper spray, according to internal text communications shared with the AP.",
      "That count does not include live ammunition, the contractor who provided the videos said.",
      "One photo shared by that contractor shows a woman lying in a donkey cart after he said she was hit in the head with part of a stun grenade.",
      "An internal report by Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF to run the sites, found that aid seekers were injured during 31% of the distributions that took place in a two-week period in June. The report did not specify the number of injuries or the cause. SRS told the AP the report refers to non-serious injuries.",
      "More videos show frenzied scenes of Palestinians running to collect leftover food boxes at one site. Hundreds of young men crowd near low metal barriers, transferring food from boxes to bags while contractors on the other side of the barriers tell them to stay back.",
      "Some Palestinians wince and cough from pepper spray. \u201cYou tasting that pepper spray? Yuck,\u201d one man close to the camera can be heard saying in English.",
      "SRS acknowledged that it\u2019s dealing with large, hungry populations, but said the environment is secure, controlled, and ensures people can get the aid they need safely."

      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after he fled Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "Anxiety is mounting over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, in which he is worshiped as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion. His succession plan is likely to have an impact on Tibetans opposed to China\u2019s tight control of the Himalayan autonomous region.",
      "The Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "The Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says that Tibet has prospered under its rule and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says that the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d that Beijing claims aim to protect the tradition and religious freedom.",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval by the central government, Mao, the ministry spokesperson, said Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "LIUYANG, China \u2014 There are few sights more dazzling than fireworks on the Fourth of July. Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.",
      "The U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them \u2014 including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations \u2014 coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.",
      "Though most Chinese-made fireworks were shipped in time for this year\u2019s Fourth of July celebrations, uncertainty hangs over future holidays as well as the \u201cgrand celebration\u201d Trump has promised for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.",
      "U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.",
      "The uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the world\u2019s fireworks. The city of about 1.5 million people is proudly known as the birthplace of fireworks, with a history in the business dating to China\u2019s Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Wendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a \u201creally hard time\u201d when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, it\u2019s 100%. But in the afternoon, it\u2019s like 200%,\u201d Tang said, making it \u201cvery hard\u201d for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.",
      "Her U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.",
      "\u201cMy customers said: \u2018OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day,\u2019\u201d said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next year\u2019s July Fourth.",
      "While most U.S. warehouses were already stocked with fireworks for this year, shows in some places may be scaled back or cost more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at $20,000 or more increased cost just to get the container out of port,\u201d Matthew Lavigne, the owner of Green Mountain Fireworks in Alburgh, Vermont, told NBC affiliate WPTZ.",
      "In a letter to Trump sent in April, the American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association said the tariffs could \u201ccripple\u201d the $2 billion fireworks industry in the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production \u2014 they will only increase costs,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Though fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trump\u2019s first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: \u201cReal prosperity and patriotism isn\u2019t celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets \u2014 it\u2019s having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.",
      "At Tang\u2019s factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.",
      "Some steps are automated, such as cutting paper and rolling it into shells or stacking tubes to form casings, but others, such as loading powder into the tubes, have to be done by hand because the work is so delicate and risky.",
      "An explosion at a Hunan fireworks factory this month killed nine people and injured 26 others, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "To prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.",
      "Workers wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange \u2014 orange being the most dangerous \u2014 to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Those working with the most dangerous materials are required to stop by around noon, before the hottest time of day.",
      "The American fireworks industry, which is made up mostly of small businesses, relies heavily on factories such as Tang\u2019s to supply events big and small.",
      "But Pyroshine Fireworks has received \u201cvery few orders\u201d recently as U.S. distributors \u201cwait and see what\u2019s going to happen with the tariffs,\u201d said Melissa Cai, the company\u2019s U.S. sales manager.",

      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",

      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",

Criminal groups are stepping into the vacuum left by the absence or limited delivery of public services and are establishing \"parallel governance structures,\" and gang control of major trade routes has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for cooking fuel and rice, Haiti's staple food, she said.",

      "Wednesday\u2019s sentence was the first in any case against Hasina since she fled to India during a mass uprising last year that toppled her 15-year rule.",
      "The contempt case stemmed from a leaked audio recording of a supposed phone conversation between Hasina and a leader of the student wing of her political party. A person alleged to be Hasina is heard on the audio saying: \u201cThere are 227 cases against me, so I now have a license to kill 227 people.\u201d",
      "The Criminal Investigation Department confirmed the audio\u2019s authenticity through forensic analysis.",
      "The recording showed Hasina\u2019s anger at the charges of murder and numerous other crimes against her under the interim administration of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, who vowed to punish Hasina and her top aides for the deaths of hundreds of people in the uprising against her.",
      "The sentencing by the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal came as a trial against her being held in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity began in June.",
      "The tribunal had ordered Hasina and her former home minister to respond by May 15. When they failed to do so, the tribunal summoned them May 25 to appear in court June 16. Later the tribunal asked for notices to be published in newspapers asking Hasina to appear.",
      "The prosecution said later neither of the suspects appeared before the court or explained their absence through a lawyer. In such circumstances, the tribunal has the authority to issue a sentence under the law.",
      "Hasina and her Awami League party had earlier criticized the tribunal and its prosecution team for their connection with political parties, especially with the Jamaat-e-Islami party.",
      "The Yunus-led government has banned the former ruling Awami League party and amended laws to allow for the party to be prosecuted for its role during the uprising.",
      "In February, the U.N. human rights office estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks in the crackdown on the student-led protests against Hasina, who was the country\u2019s longest serving prime minister.",
      "The tribunal was established by Hasina in 2009 to investigate and try crimes involving Bangladesh\u2019s independence war in 1971. The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war against Pakistan. Aided by India, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father and the country\u2019s first leader."

      "In a message sent to The Associated Press, the U.S. Embassy in Cuba stated that, according to its privacy policies, it could not comment on specific cases but that directives were being implemented to secure the borders and protect U.S. communities and citizens.",
      "The Cuban women's national team won back-to-back world championships in 1994 and 1998. It also won three Olympic golds in a row in Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000.",
      "The U.S. measures are likely to impact many more Cuban athletes who depend on international competitions, including some on American soil to qualify for major championships and the next Olympics scheduled to be played in Los Angeles in 2028."

      "LONDON \u2014 It was not her best goal or most important soccer match, but when the ball hit the back of the net in Natalie Washington's debut on a women's team in 2017, she felt a sense of belonging that had been missing.",
      "It was long in coming: Washington had struggled to fit in on a men's team and eventually stopped playing when she decided to transition to being a woman and go through gender-affirming surgery. When she joined a women's team, she quickly felt accepted.",
      "Now, after the United Kingdom's highest court in April said that for anti-discrimination purposes the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" refer to biological sex, Washington's opportunity to play the sport she loves in the league she wants is in doubt.",
      "The head of the U.K's Equality and Human Rights Commission followed the ruling a day later by saying the court had provided clarity and that transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "The Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in the U.K., followed up by banning transgender players from women's teams in England and Scotland, a ban that took effect at the start of June.",
      "\"It feels like things are being taken away from trans people on an almost daily basis,\" Washington said. \"It's another blow, another kick at a time when people are already hurting.\"",
      "Long a divisive issue",
      "Beyond Britain, inclusion of trans players in sports has long been a divisive issue, with arguments primarily focused on whether it's fair to have athletes born as boys compete against girls and women. In the U.S., it has been particularly politicized, with most Republican-controlled states banning transgender athletes in girls' sports and President Donald Trump signing an executive order to prohibit participation of transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "The U.K. court said trans people were still protected from discrimination under British law, such as in employment, housing and education, but the ruling means access to certain single-sex facilities could be curtailed.",
      "Trans rights groups condemned the decision, which is likely to have a profound effect for thousands. Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count.",
      "The feminist groups who led the legal challenge cheered the ruling and others, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, welcomed the clarity it brought.",
      "\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" said Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, which brought the case.",
      "A difficult decision",
      "Washington, who leads the group Football v Transphobia, was one of 28 transgender women registered with the Football Association to play amateur soccer. In order to play the women's game, they had to have testosterone levels reduced to the range of biologically born females.",
      "After the ruling, the organization changed its rules, saying that although it had aimed to make soccer accessible to as many people as possible, it was always prepared to alter its policy if there were changes in the law or science.",
      "\"We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,\" the FA said, adding that it would contact transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can remain involved.",
      "Some clubs have responded by finding ways around the ban. Goal Diggers FC, a women and nonbinary inclusive soccer club based in London, has withdrawn from all FA-affiliated leagues.",
      "On June 1, the day the ban took effect, Goal Diggers hosted an inclusive women's tournament in London, drawing more than 100 players in a show of solidarity.",
      "\"I'll always have a place here and I'll always be a trans woman,\" said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old trans player for Goal Diggers. \"No one can take that away from me.\"",
      "Other voices, other sports",
      "Groups that have campaigned to keep trans athletes from girls' and women's teams, citing a matter of safety and fairness, welcomed the move by the FA.",
      "\"The FA had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in women's teams,\" said Fiona McAnena of Sex Matters.",
      "Groups that oversee cricket and netball, an offshoot of basketball that is played mainly by women, also limited women's competition to those who were assigned at birth as females.",
      "The England and Wales Cricket Board said transgender women and girls could continue playing in open and mixed cricket. England Netball said it would allow anyone to play in a new mixed category beginning in September.",
      "How the ruling came about",
      "The legal case involved a 2018 Scottish law requiring at least half of the seats on public boards to be held by women. Trans women with certificates recognizing their gender were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "The court said that using the certificates to identify someone's gender clashes with the definitions of man and woman. Under the ruling, a transgender person could not claim they had been discriminated against if barred from a single-sex space.",
      "Alexander Maine, a senior lecturer at The City Law School specializing in gender, sexuality and law, said the ruling clouds the value of a document sanctioned by the U.K. Gender Recognition Act that allows them to later update their birth certificate reflecting their acquired gender.",
      "\"There may be a challenge at the European Court of Human Rights brought by trans individuals who say that there is a problem where they may be two sexes at once,\" Maine said.",
      "Someone could hold \"a gender recognition certificate stating that they are their acquired gender, whereas under the U.K. Equality Act, they are still recognized in their birth gender,\" he said.",
      "Washington and many others say they worry the ruling may lead to more hatred aimed at trans people.",
      "\"For the first time in a long time, I felt scared about how people are going to react to me in public,\" Washington said. \"I don't feel anymore that I can guarantee I have support to turn to from authorities.\""
