      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",
      "Francis Ford Coppola wagered everything he had on his masterpiece \u2014 and nearly lost it. \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d to the Vietnam War, is an epic of madness that teeters on the brink of hallucination. Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s stirring film dramatizes the Washington Post\u2019s 1971 publishing of the Pentagon Papers, a collection of classified documents that chronicled America\u2019s 20-year involvement in Southeast Asia. While government analyst Daniel Ellsberg (a moving participant in \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d) could be considered the hero of this story, \u201cThe Post\u201d turns its focus to Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and the wartime role of the Fourth Estate.",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is on trial again after an appeals court threw out the ex-studio-boss' 2020 rape conviction in a case that was a watershed for the #MeToo movement",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements began Wednesday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s rape retrial, five years after his original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful figures.",
      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",
      "The retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the first trial, and two accusers who testified then are expected to return.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first, which happened during the height of the #MeToo movement. Along with the charges being retried, he faces an additional allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t involved in the first case.",
      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",
      "A woman opined that \u201cnot enough has been done\u201d as a result of #MeToo. A man explained that he had negative feelings about it because his high school classmates had been falsely accused of sexual assault.",
      "Another man said he viewed #MeToo like other social movements: \u201cIt\u2019s a pendulum. It swings way one way, then way the other way, and then it settles.\u201d",

      "The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal history and what it has taken to overcome it",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "He said he would use the pardon for much more than going on tour, though.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll still be using this same pardon, God willing, to go do missionary work in my 50s and 60s,\u201d he said.",
      "Due to his criminal record, he told the board that every time he travels it \u201ctakes a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.\u201d He said he recently was able to make his first tour in Canada and took his first trip to the United Kingdom, where he spoke about a rehabilitation program.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks at least five years since his sentence expired.",
      "Lee has issued more than 90 pardons since taking office in 2019, all of them since 2021.",

      "Opening statements are set in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements are set for Wednesday in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case.",
      "After a dayslong selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors by Monday, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can\u2019t see the trial through.",
      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",
      "But in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York\u2019s highest court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge\u2019s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Drawn from Manhattan\u2019s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.",
      "One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master\u2019s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.",
      "Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein \u2014 \u201cthe first word that came in my head was \u2018pig,\u2019\u201d said one man who was soon let go.",
      "Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.",
      "\u201cYou may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\u201d defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",
      "Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think, \u2018OK, that\u2019s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I\u2019m deciding this case\u2019? Everyone can put that aside?\u201d Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn\u2019t part of the original trial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is challenging a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",
      "Next year's Academy Awards will be held March 15, 2026, with Conan O'Brien returning to host the ABC telecast.",

      "But creator Tony Gilroy says he and his collaborators felt little pressure from Disney and Lucasfilm as they sought to tell the story of a growing revolutionary resentment against the Galactic Empire and the birth of the Rebel Alliance leading up to the events of the 2016 film he scripted, \u201cRogue One.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe took no creative notes on this show,\u201d Gilroy, whose deep screenwriting resume also includes four films in the \u201cBourne\u201d franchise and 2007 Oscar nominee \u201cMichael Clayton,\" which he also directed. He told The Associated Press that \u201cI\u2019ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.\u201d",

      "The new episodes trace how the spark lit in Diego Luna's Cassian Andor in the 2022 first season spreads through the galaxy. And they do it with characters and arcs rarely found in this realm before.",
      "\u201cThis second season, it\u2019s about all the layers, and the social and political climate that needs to happen for a revolution to erupt, for a rebellion to exist,\u201d Luna told the AP. \u201cThe universe of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 never stopped to tell the story of these regular people that becomes crucial for the history that we know.\u201d",
      "Gilroy drew inspiration from a broad range of historical and fictional sources.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ever going to get another chance to do another 1,500 pages on revolution again, with this much money and this much muscle, and everything else?\u201d he said.",
      "But as epic as the story is, its most essential moments are marked by intimate, one-on-one conversations.",
      "\u201cI start small,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI work teaspoon by teaspoon.\u201d",
      "That includes a season-opening scene that starts with Cassian giving a young imperial mechanic the courage to help him in a major heist. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It\u2019s a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,\u201d Luna said.",
      "Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They're never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",
      "The overall direction of the show was basically determined when work began on the series five years ago.",
      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing with Cassian,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI know that the first year is the making of a revolutionary and the road to Damascus, that\u2019s the first year, I know I\u2019m leading to Rogue, I know where he\u2019s gonna end up.\"",
      "Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\u2019Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances.",
      "Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals \u2014 and dances \u2014 new to \u201cStar Wars\u201d that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had.",

      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release.

Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",

      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences.

      "\u201cOn some days, I\u2019m like that was just a blink away. But for the most part, yeah, it feels like a long time because I\u2019ve been waiting. I felt stagnant, I felt stuck for a while, and conflicted,\u201d said the two-time Grammy-nominated artist. \u201cI\u2019m very much approaching this like I\u2019m starting over because that\u2019s how it feels to me. I\u2019ve lived nine lives since I last released \u2026 I\u2019m a whole different person.\u201d",

It's her third album, following 2010\u2019s \u201cNo Boys Allowed,\u201d and is the first of a trilogy set for release this year. Led by the sultry single \u201cBae,\u201d the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection.",
      "\u201cI feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,\u201d explained Hilson, who said she\u2019s never stopped recording. \u201cThere were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn\u2019t really love that I had to sing \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to feel like that this time around.\u201d",
      "One of those songs was a leaked remix to her popular 2009 single \u201cTurnin Me On\u201d featuring Lil Wayne, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics included a diss fans perceived to be aimed at Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, \u201cIn A Perfect World,\u201d which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, \u201cShe can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,\u201d assumed to reference Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused.",
      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very \u2018girl boss\u2019 in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",
      "The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam \u201cScream,\u201d while the bright \u201cWhatever\u201d floats with beautiful stacked harmonies.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Novavax's closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is on track for full approval after additional discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said Wednesday.",
      "The news sent company shares soaring more than 21% in morning trading and appeared to resolve concerns that Trump administration officials might be holding up a decision on the shot.",
      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. It is still being sold under emergency use authorization \u2014 unlike mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "The FDA recently asked Novavax to develop a plan for collecting additional clinical data from those who have gotten the shot, the company said in a statement. It said it is \u201cengaging with the FDA expeditiously\u201d in hopes of receiving approval \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "At FDA, full vaccine approval is the gold standard. The agency was on track to sign off on Novavax\u2019s license by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "But FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Dr. Sara Brenner, directed the agency\u2019s lead official overseeing the vaccine to pause the decision, according to one of the people. The delay, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sparked concerns of political interference under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who spent decades leading antivaccine groups before joining the federal government as health secretary.",
      "Last month, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced out over disagreements with Kennedy about vaccine safety.",
      "With full FDA approval, Novavax would have permission to keep its shot on the market indefinitely. Products that receive emergency authorization can be removed by FDA after there is no longer a health emergency.",
      "All the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. train the body to fight the coronavirus by recognizing its outer coating, the spike protein.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna options deliver genetic instructions for the body to temporarily make copies of the protein. In contrast, the Novavax vaccine uses lab-grown copies of the spike protein packaged into nanoparticles and combined with an immune-revving ingredient. Protein-based vaccines have been used for years to prevent other diseases including hepatitis B and shingles.",

      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials in the Gaza Strip say more than 400 dialysis patients have died during the 18-month Israel-Hamas war because of lack of proper treatment",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Twice a week, Mohamed Attiya\u2019s wheelchair rattles over Gaza\u2019s scarred roads so he can visit the machine that is keeping him alive.",
      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Californians can now buy opioid reversal drugs directly from the state under a program aimed at making the life-saving medication less expensive and more accessible, officials said Monday.",
      "The state began selling its own generic version of Narcan last year for $24 per twin-pack to businesses and local governments, and will now also sell to individual consumers online. A box containing two doses of naloxone nasal spray costs between $45 and $70 from regular pharmacies and online marketplaces.",
      "Opioid overdose deaths, which are caused by heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone, have increased dramatically in California and across the country in recent years, reaching 7,847 in the state in 2023. But California officials say they have started to see a decline in these deaths.",
      "The move is part of a broader push by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to try to force drug companies to lower their prices by offering cheaper, competing versions of medication under the state's CalRx label.",
      "\u201cLife-saving medications shouldn\u2019t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all \u2014 not the privileged few,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Naloxone, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, has been available in the U.S. without a prescription since March of 2023, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Narcan, a nasal spray brand produced by the Maryland-based pharmaceutical company Emergent BioSolutions.",
      "California is also working on a plan to make insulin more affordable for residents. The state has an agreement with the nonprofit Civica to produce CalRx-branded insulin used to treat diabetes.",

      "A woman in the southern African country of Namibia runs a program that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism",
      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Susan de Meyer's horses have different effects on different children. Hyperactive kids learn to be a little quieter around them while nonverbal children are moved to communicate and to bond with them.",
      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",
      "De Meyer said her program helps with fine-motor skills, gross-motor skills, muscle strengthening, coordination, balance and posture, all important for kids who struggle to sit at a desk at school and learn.",
      "One simple exercise de Meyer has children do when they ride is to let go of the reins and stretch their arms out straight and to the sides, using only their torso and lower body to balance as a groom leads the horse around the paddock.",
      "Some of the kids break out in smiles when they let go and look like they're soaring.",
      "\"We make the world different for these kids,\" de Meyer said.",

      "America\u2019s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep in as little as a few hours.",
      "Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They\u2019re joining a trend that has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible.",
      "Fast prescription delivery options are growing as traditional drugstores close and more people use telemedicine or subscription-based care that encourages regular deliveries.",
      "But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot to change people\u2019s behavior when it comes to their health care,\u201d said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester.",
      "Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023.",
      "Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours.",
      "Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix.",
      "Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It\u2019s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds.",
      "Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",
      "Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries \u201cmaybe 10 years from now when I\u2019m not able to do it myself.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions.",
      "\u201cSometimes the wait can be a little long \u2026 that\u2019s my only gripe,\u201d he said.",

      "Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans each year",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans when trees, grass, and other pollens cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing and sneezing.",
      "Where you live, what you\u2019re allergic to and your lifestyle can make a big difference when it comes to the severity of your allergies. Experts say climate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons, but also point out that treatments for seasonal allergies have become more effective over the last decade.",
      "Here are some tips from experts to keep allergy symptoms at bay \u2014 maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.",
      "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists.",
      "This year, the top five cities are: Wichita, Kansas; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Memphis.",
      "There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.",
      "Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.",
      "Pollen trackers can help you decide when to go outside. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.",
      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

Instead, Beijing raised its own tariffs and deployed other economic measures in response while vowing to \u201cfight to the end.\u201d For example, China restricted exports of rare earth minerals and raised multiple cases against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.",

      "Zelenskyy arrived in South Africa late Wednesday night just as Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on the Ukrainian capital that killed at least nine people and injured more than 70.",
      "Zelenskyy's trip came as U.S. President Donald Trump made new accusations against him, saying he was prolonging the three-year war by pushing back against any plan to give up territory in any peace deal. Zelenskyy has refused to cede illegally occupied Crimea to Russia as part of a potential peace plan.",

South Africa holds the rotating presidency of the G20 this year.",
      "Ramaphosa has put himself forward as a possible mediator in the war due to South Africa\u2019s ties with Russia through the BRICS bloc of developing nations. Ramaphosa has said he is one of the few leaders that can talk to both sides, although his efforts have produced little concrete progress.",

      "Cyprus officials say the east Mediterranean island nation will receive free-of-charge portable desalination plants from the United Arab Emirates to cover its water needs this summer as reservoir deposits are nearly depleted",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus will receive free-of-charge portable desalination plants from the United Arab Emirates to cover the tourism-reliant island nation\u2019s water needs this summer as reservoir deposits are nearly depleted, officials said Thursday.",
      "Agriculture and Environment Minister Maria Panayiotou told the state broadcaster that the UAE agreed to provide Cyprus, at no cost, an undetermined number of desalination plants that will produce a combined 15,000 cubic meters (530,000 cubic feet) of potable water daily.",
      "Panayiotou didn\u2019t disclose exactly when the units will arrive and become operational, but she said UAE authorities are aware the need is immediate as the summer tourism season kicks into high gear and water needs reach their peak.",
      "She said the deal is the result of secret negotiations over the last few months to cover Cyprus water needs that became acute when a fire knocked out one of its five static desalination plants, resulting in cuts to agricultural water supply. Each onshore unit produces 235,000 cubic meters (8.3 million cubic feet) of fresh water daily.",
      "The plant won\u2019t be back in operation until August and the portable units from the UAE will cover that lost water capacity, said Panayiotou.",
      "Technical staff are still trying to work out exactly where the portable units will be placed to maximize their utility, Panayiotou said. She didn\u2019t say when those units will be returned to the UAE.",
      "Apart from its own desalination plants, Cyprus continues to rely on an extensive reservoir network with a total capacity of 330 million cubic meters. Water levels across the 108 reservoirs \u2014 the most relative to population than any other European country \u2014 are less than a quarter of their capacity following the second-driest winter in a decade. Reservoirs were at 47.2% capacity in 2024, official figures show.",
      "Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides disclosed the UAE deal during an interview with local TV station ANT1, hailing the agreement as the result of Cyprus\u2019 expanded diplomatic outreach and the friendly relations it has developed particularly with the Emirates and other countries in the region.",
      "Panayiotou said irrespective of the UAE assistance, the government\u2019s medium- and long-term planning to permanently alleviate the island\u2019s water shortages is moving ahead.",
      "The planning includes the procurement of four additional mobile desalination plants expected to begin operating in late autumn, each capable of producing 30,000 cubic meters (1 million cubic feet) of drinkable water daily.",
      "Another two static desalination plants will be built over the long term, each with a 140,000 cubic meter (5 million cubic feet) daily output.",
      "Panayiotou unveiled last month a government plan to subsidize construction of private desalination plants at hotels. Tourism accounts for 13.5% of Cyprus\u2019 gross domestic product. Tourist arrivals last year exceeded 4 million people, setting a new record.",

      "BEIJING -- Kenyan President William Ruto pledged to build closer ties with China on Thursday, a day after saying a global trade war triggered by Washington could deal a \u201cdeath blow\u201d to the current world order.",
      "Ruto is on a five-day visit to China, his third trip to Beijing since taking office in 2022. The visit comes at a time when both Kenya and China are seeking to expand ties amid a tariff fight between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Kenya wants to learn from \u201cChina\u2019s remarkable journey of transformation in governance, economic development and global leadership,\u201d Ruto said. He thanked Chinese leader Xi Jinping for tens of millions of dollars in support for health, education and disaster relief, as well as for the planned construction of a new complex for Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Ruto, an evangelical Christian from a modest background, was elected on promises to help Kenya\u2019s poor in a country struggling with debt. Earlier in his presidency, Ruto favored the West and the United States over China. But as U.S. President Donald Trump pulls back from engagement with Africa and slaps tariffs on trade partners, Ruto is making overtures to Beijing.",
      "Xi told Ruto that \u201cChina attaches great importance to China-Kenya relations\u201d and that Beijing would work with Kenya to develop the \u201cunity and cooperation of the global South.\u201d Xi is looking to shore up partnerships and find solutions for the high trade barrier that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese exports.",
      "Kenya is a key participant in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, the ambitious plan that aims to connect Africa, Asia and Europe through massive infrastructure and energy projects. China has funded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Kenyan roads, ports and a railway that runs from the coastal city of Mombasa through the capital, Nairobi.",
      "During a keynote speech at China\u2019s prestigious Peking University on Wednesday, Ruto criticized the U.N. Security Council and the current world order, calling it \u201cbroken, dysfunctional and no longer fit for purpose,\u201d and said the tariffs imposed by Trump \u201cmay be its final death blow.\u201d",
      "Many African nations face uncertainty over the tariffs, which threaten key industries that export to the United States. The U.S. is one of Kenya\u2019s largest export destinations, while China is Kenya\u2019s top supplier.",
      "After the meeting, the two countries signed security, technology, and economic agreements, as well as agreements on railways and the establishment of a new Kenyan consulate in Guangzhou.",

      "SRINAGAR, India -- Tensions between India and Pakistan were high on Thursday as New Delhi mounted a diplomatic offensive against Islamabad, blaming it for a deadly attack that killed 26 people in Kashmir and shattered India's claims of calm in a disputed region where a bloody rebellion against Indian rule has been ongoing for decades.",
      "A rare attack on civilians \u2014 mostly tourists who were visiting a popular scenic meadow \u2014 shocked and outraged India and prompted calls for action against their country's archenemy, Pakistan. The Indian government did not publicly produce any evidence connecting the attack to its neighbor, but said it had \u201ccross-border\u201d links to Pakistan. Pakistan denied any connection to the attack, which was claimed by a previously unknown militant group that called itself the Kashmir Resistance.",
      "India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. New Delhi describes all militancy in Kashmir as Pakistan-backed terrorism. Pakistan denies this, and many Muslim Kashmiris consider the militants to be part of a home-grown freedom struggle.",
      "The killings also put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government to respond aggressively. His government announced a series of diplomatic actions against Islamabad while hinting at plans for more punishment.",
      "Pakistan has responded angrily that it has nothing to do with the attack and said it would formulate a response to India's actions on Thursday in the National Security Committee meeting, the country's highest decision-making forum of senior civil and military officials.",
      "Dozens of demonstrators in Islamabad and other cities in Pakistan rallied against India\u2019s suspension of a water sharing treaty, demanding their government retaliate.",
      "\u201cIndia has taken irresponsible steps and leveled allegations,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told local Dunya News TV channel.",
      "Dar added that \u201cany kinetic step by India will see a tit-to-tat kinetic response\u201d from Pakistan, rekindling memories of February 2019 when a car suicide bombing in Kashmir brought the two countries to the verge of war.",
      "Modi overturned the status quo in Kashmir in August 2019, when his government revoked the region's semi-autonomous status and brought it under direct federal control.",
      "That deepened tensions in the region, but things with Pakistan held stable as the two countries in 2021 renewed a previous ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held despite attacks on Indian forces by insurgents in Kashmir.",
      "The latest incident could once again raise the specter of conflict between two nuclear-armed neighbors that have long accused each other of backing forces to destabilize the other.",
      "At a public rally Thursday, Modi said \u201cIndia will identify, track and punish every terrorist, their handlers and their backers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will pursue them to the ends of the earth,\u201d said Modi, who was later in the day scheduled to head an all-party meeting with opposition parties to brief them on the government\u2019s response to the attack.",
      "India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, announced Wednesday night that a number of Pakistani diplomats were asked to leave New Delhi and Indian diplomats were recalled from Pakistan. Diplomatic missions in both countries will reduce their staff from 55 to 30 as of May 1, and the only functional land border crossing between the countries would be closed.",
      "India also suspended a landmark water-sharing treaty that has survived two wars between the countries, in 1965 and 1971, and a major border skirmish in 1999.",
      "The Indus Water Treaty, brokered by the World Bank in 1960, allows for sharing the waters of a river system that is a lifeline for both countries, particularly for Pakistan\u2019s agriculture.",
      "Some experts say India may move beyond diplomatic sanctions as the country\u2019s media and leaders from Modi\u2019s ruling party call for military action.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, defense minister, Rajnath Singh, pledged to \u201cnot only trace those who perpetrated the attack but also trace those who conspired to commit this nefarious act on our soil\u201d and hinted at the possibility of military strikes.",
      "Ashok Malik, a former policy advisor in India\u2019s foreign ministry, said New Delhi\u2019s response reflected a high degree of anger within the administration and India\u2019s move on the Indus Water treaty \u201cwill impose costs on Pakistan\u2019s economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIslamabad will have to deal with the consequences,\u201d Malik said, adding that Indian leaders view military options as viable.",
      "\u201cIts (India's) military strategists believe there is a space for kinetic conventional action under the nuclear umbrella. The space isn\u2019t infinite, but it isn\u2019t insignificant either,\u201d he said.",
      "Praveen Donthi, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said framing the Kashmir conflict as a security crisis of Pakistan\u2019s creation, \u201cwhich can be resolved only through harsh talk and actions,\u201d brings political dividends to Modi\u2019s government but could also leave it with few options in times of crises.",
      "\u201cThe immense public pressure on the Modi government to retaliate strongly and militarily is self-created. Soon, there will be no options left unless New Delhi starts looking to address the roots of political unrest in Kashmir,\u201d Donthi said.",
      "The killings shocked residents of Kashmir, where militants fighting against Indian rule have rarely targeted tourists and have mainly mounted their attacks against Indian forces.",
      "In a rare show of public outrage, Kashmiris \u2014 many of whom have roiled under an intense crackdown by Indian forces and New Delhi's highhanded rule \u2014 took part in street protests and candle light marches in protest against the killings. Markets, private schools and businesses were also shut Wednesday amidst an uneasy calm as people worried that the attacks could drive away tourists and hurt the region\u2019s economy.",
      "Funerals of several of those killed were also held across some Indian cities.",

      "The South Korean government\u2019s fact-finding commission has suspended its groundbreaking investigation into the extensive fraud and abuse that tainted the nation\u2019s historic foreign adoption program, stemming from internal disputes among commissioners abo...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government\u2019s fact-finding commission suspended its groundbreaking investigation into the extensive fraud and abuse that tainted the nation\u2019s historic foreign adoption program, a decision stemming from internal disputes among commissioners regarding which cases warranted recognition as problematic.",
      "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission confirmed human rights violations in just 56 of the 367 complaints filed by adoptees before suspending its investigation Wednesday night, just one month before its May 26 deadline.",
      "The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, now hinges on whether lawmakers will establish a new truth commission through legislation during Seoul\u2019s next government, which takes office after the presidential by-election on June 3.",
      "After a nearly three-year investigation into adoption cases across Europe, the United States, and Australia, the commission concluded in a March interim report that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program riddled with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to cut welfare costs and carried out by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "However, some adoptees, and even members of the commission, criticized the cautiously-worded report, arguing that it should have more forcefully established the government\u2019s complicity. Disputes also arose after the commission\u2019s nine-member decision-making panel, dominated by conservative-leaning members appointed by recently ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol and his party, voted on March 25 to defer the assessments of 42 adoptee cases, citing insufficient documentation to conclusively prove the adoptions were problematic.",
      "Commission officials haven\u2019t disclosed which documents were central to the discussions. However, they suggested that some commissioners were hesitant to recognize cases where adoptees couldn\u2019t definitively prove falsification of biological details in their adoption papers, either through meeting their birth parents or verifying information about them.",
      "On Wednesday, the panel resolved the standoff by unanimously agreeing to suspend, rather than completely drop, the investigation into the 42 cases. The approach leaves open the door for the cases to be reconsidered if a future truth commission is established. The panel also agreed to suspend investigations into the remaining 269 cases, citing insufficient time to complete the reviews before the deadline, according to three commission sources who described the discussions to the Associated Press.",
      "It was unclear if and when another commission will be established . Political attention is now focused on the early presidential election. South Korea\u2019s constitutional Court formally removed Yoon from office on April 4, months after the opposition-controlled legislature impeached him over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The ruling triggered a snap presidential election set for June 3. Park Geon Tae, a senior investigator who led the probe into adoptions, said the truth commission would be unable to produce any further investigation reports on adoptions before the end of its mandate, after the terms of five of the nine commissioners ended following Wednesday\u2019s meeting. This potentially paralyzes the decision-making process, which requires the support of at least five members. Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, even though many had relatives who could have been easily identified or located. This practice has often made it difficult\u2014or even impossible\u2014for them to trace their roots.",
      "The reluctance of some commissioners to accept cases in which adoptees have been unable to find information about their birth parents reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoption and contradicts the commission\u2019s broader findings, which acknowledged the manipulation of children\u2019s origins, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at South Korea\u2019s Anyang University. Shin\u2019s analysis of government, law enforcement, and adoption records concludes that more than 90% of Korean children sent to the West between 1980 and 1987, when adoptions peaked, almost certainly had known relatives.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings released in March broadly aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means.",
      "Military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues related to past adoptions and has so far not responded to the commission\u2019s recommendation to issue an official apology.",
      "Modeled after the South African commission established in the 1990s to expose apartheid-era injustices, South Korea originally launched the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2006 to investigate past human rights violations. That ended its work in 2010.",
      "Following the passing of a law that allowed for more investigations, the commission was relaunched in December 2020 under South Korea\u2019s former liberal government, with a focus on cases that occurred during the country\u2019s military dictatorships from the 1960s to 1980s.",
      "Foreign adoptions were a major subject of the second commission, along with the atrocities at Brothers Home, a government-funded facility in Busan that kidnapped, abused and enslaved thousands of children and adults deemed as vagrants for decades until the 1980s.",
      "In January, the commission confirmed at least 31 cases in which children from Brothers Home were adopted abroad, which came years after The AP exposed adoptions from the facility as part of a vast, profit-driven operation.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean prosecutors indicted former liberal President Moon Jae-in on bribery charges Thursday, saying that a budget airline gave his son-in-law a lucrative no-show job during Moon's term in office.",
      "Moon's indictment adds him to a long list of South Korean leaders who have faced trials or scandals at the close of their terms or after leaving office.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Moon, who served as president from 2017-2022, received bribes totaling 217 million won ($151,705) from Lee Sang-jik, founder of the budget carrier Thai Eastar Jet, in the form of wages, housing expenses and other financial assistance provided to Moon\u2019s then-son-in-law from 2018-2020.",
      "South Korean media reported that Moon's daughter and her husband were divorced in 2021.",
      "The Jeonju District Prosecutors' Office said in a statement that Lee was also indicted on charges of paying bribes to Moon and committing breaches of trust.",
      "The prosecutors\u2019 office said Moon\u2019s former son-in-law was hired as a director-level employee at Lee\u2019s company in Thailand even though he had no work experience in the airline industry. The office said he spent only brief periods at the company's office in Thailand and carried out only minor duties while claiming to be working remotely from South Korea.",
      "The prosecutors\u2019 office said it had not found evidence that Moon performed political favors for Lee, who worked on Moon's campaign, but that Lee likely expected his assistance to be repaid.",
      "Lee was later named the head of the state-funded Korea SME and Startups Agency and was nominated by Moon's party to run for parliament while Moon was in office, but the the prosecutors\u2019 office said that it hasn't found any evidence that Moon helped Lee win those positions.",
      "There was no immediate response from Moon.",
      "Moon\u2019s indictment comes before South Korea elects a new president on June 3 to succeed conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over an ill-fated imposition of martial law. It\u2019s unclear if Moon\u2019s indictment will influence prospects for liberals to win back the presidency.",
      "Observers say liberal presidential aspirant Lee Jae-myung is heavily favored to win the vote as conservatives remain in disarray over Yoon\u2019s ouster, although Lee also faces criminal trials on allegations of corruption and other charges.",
      "Most past South Korean presidents have been embroiled in scandal in the final months of their terms or after leaving office. In 2017, Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president, was removed from office and arrested over an explosive corruption scandal.",
      "Park's conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak was also arrested on a range of crimes, years after leaving office. Moon's friend and former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun jumped to his death in 2009 amid corruption investigations into his family.",
      "Moon is best known for his push to reconcile with rival North Korea as he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times and facilitated the start of the high-stakes nuclear diplomacy between Kim and President Donald Trump.",
      "Moons\u2019 supporters credit him with achieving now-stalled cooperation with North Korea and avoiding major armed clashes, but opponents say he was a naive North Korea sympathizer who ended up helping the North buy time to advance its nuclear program in the face of international sanctions and pressure.",

      "The Liberals and the country's new prime minister, Mark Carney, looked headed for a crushing defeat in Monday's election until the American president started attacking Canada\u2019s economy and even threatening its sovereignty, including suggesting it should become the 51st state.",
      "Trump\u2019s dumping on Canada has infuriated its people and stoked a surge in Canadian nationalism that has helped the Liberals flip the election narrative.",
      "\u201cTrump has immersed himself into our lives and has defined the ballot question,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",

      "The opposition Conservative Party\u2019s leader, Pierre Poilievre, hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.",
      "But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned and Carney, a two-time central banker, became the Liberal Party\u2019s leader and prime minister.",
      "\u201dWe were looking at a scenario where the Conservatives were going to rake in a huge majority,\u201d said Charest, a Conservative. \u201cHere we are months later in another world.\u201d",

      "In a mid-January poll by Nanos, Liberals trailed the Conservative Party by 47% to 20%. In the latest Nanos poll that ended April 22, the Liberals led by five percentage points. The January poll had a margin of error 3.1 points while the latest poll had a 2.7-point margin.",
      "Until a few months ago, Poilievre was seen as a shoo-in to become the next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",
      "Ian Brodie, a former chief of staff to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said it's frustrating that this year's Conservative campaign plan had to change so drastically.",
      "\u201cAt least 40% of the electorate is just petrified about the continued existence of the country,\u201d Brodie said. \"... In a sense, it is a once in a lifetime lineup of forces that works against everything Pierre been doing since he got himself into politics.\u201d",
      "Brodie said a Conservative win will be tough and that the party's situation might not improve anytime soon, noting support for a small progressive party, the New Democrats, has been shrinking for years, making it a two-party struggle.",
      "\u201cIf you are into two-party competition for the foreseeable future, then you have to be much closer to the center of the political spectrum than the Conservatives have been,\u201d Brodie said, noting that the party might need a new leader.",
      "Whoever the next prime minister is will face challenges.",
      "Both Carney and Poilievre said that if elected, they would accelerate renegotiations of the countries\u2019 free trade deal in an effort to end the uncertainty hurting both of their economies.",
      "Carney, in particular, has notable experience navigating economic crises, having done so when he ran Canada\u2019s central bank and when he later became the first non-U.K. citizen to run the Bank of England since its founding in 1694.",
      "\u201cThe problems are really inconceivable, worse than any Canadian prime minister has had to face, I think ever,\" said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",
      "\u201cNot only is Carney the luckiest guy alive and came in at absolutely the right moment, but once he actually starts having to administer the country, the Trump problem, the American problem, is just inconceivable,\" he said. \"It\u2019s like being handed a sack full of rabid beavers.\u201d",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s outspoken Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen has been allowed to leave the southern Chinese city to attend Pope Francis\u2019 funeral in Vatican City",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's outspoken Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen was allowed to leave the southern Chinese city to attend Pope Francis' funeral in Vatican City.",
      "Zen, a 93-year-old retired bishop, left Hong Kong on Wednesday night after applying at a court to get back his passport, his secretary told The Associated Press in a text message on Thursday. Authorities confiscated his passport after his controversial arrest under a Beijing-imposed national security law in 2022.",
      "Zen is among the critics in recent years who have said the Vatican\u2019s agreement with Chinese authorities on the appointment of bishops betrays pro-Vatican Chinese Catholics. He has also criticized Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, the official charged with negotiations with Beijing, as a \u201cman of little faith.\"",
      "Parolin is considered one of the main contenders to be the next pope, given his prominence in the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "On Tuesday, media reports said Zen had issued a critique of the Vatican, questioning why pre-conclave meetings started as early as Tuesday. The AP could not independently verify the reports, but Zen reposted the reporters' posts about his statement on his X account.",
      "Given his age, Zen will not be among the cardinals voting in the conclave for a new pope.",
      "His secretary said Zen would return to Hong Kong after the late pope\u2019s funeral, which is scheduled for Saturday. But she was unsure about his exact return date.",
      "It was not the first time Zen had to go through the city's court to leave Hong Kong. In 2023, he went through similar procedures to pay his respects to the late Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. He met Pope Francis in a private audience during that trip, but suffered health issues and was hospitalized for a time after his return to the city.",
      "Last November, he was seen attending the national security trial of Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. He could walk on his own at that time.",
      "Zen was first arrested in 2022 on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces under the security law. His arrest sent shockwaves through the Catholic community at that time.",
      "While Zen has not yet faced national security-related charges, he and five others were fined in 2022 after being found guilty of failing to register a now-defunct fund that aimed to help people arrested in widespread 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. A hearing on his appeal against the conviction is scheduled for December.",
      "Separately, Hong Kong cardinal Stephen Chow will travel to the Vatican for the conclave, the city's Catholic Social Communications Office said Thursday.",
      "In 2023, a Beijing bishop who was installed by China's state-controlled Catholic church as an archbishop visited Hong Kong at the invitation of Chow. It was the first-ever official visit by a Beijing bishop to the city. Experts at that time said Chow's invitation was a symbolic gesture that could strengthen the fragile ties between China and the Vatican.",
      "Beijing and the Vatican severed diplomatic ties following the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s rise to power and the expulsion of foreign priests. Since the break in ties, Catholics in China have been divided between those who belong to an official, state-sanctioned church and those in an underground church loyal to the pope. The Vatican recognizes members of both as Catholics but claims the exclusive right to choose bishops.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like praying for our church and asking the Lord, through the intercession of the pope, to continue guiding us,\u201d the 27-year-old said while waiting in line to enter the basilica.",

      "The papacy of Pope Francis ended with the same core doctrine for LGBTQ+ people that he had inherited",
      "The papacy of Pope Francis ended with the same core doctrine for LGBTQ+ people that he inherited: The Catholic Church still rejected same-sex marriage and condemned any sexual relations between gay or lesbian partners as \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d",
      "Yet unlike his predecessors, Francis incrementally conveyed through his actions, formal statements and occasional casual remarks that he wanted the church to be a more welcoming place for them.",
      "Among activists, there was frustration over the lack of a doctrinal breakthrough, but still there was gratitude this week for his unabashed warmth toward them.",
      "Francis, who died Monday, \u201cwas a transformational leader who included LGBTQ people in historic ways,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of the U.S.-based advocacy group GLAAD, who met twice with the pope. \u201cHis principles of empathetic listening, inclusion, and compassion are exactly what this divided world needs right now.\u201d",
      "Many conservative Catholic leaders were wary of his LGBTQ+ outreach \u2014 and sometimes were angry and defiant, such as when he decided in 2023 to let priests bless same-sex couples.",
      "Africa\u2019s bishops united in refusing to implement the Vatican declaration, saying same-sex relationships were \u201ccontrary to the will of God.\u201d Individual bishops in Eastern Europe, Latin America and elsewhere also voiced opposition.",
      "The declaration restated traditional church teaching that marriage is a lifelong union between a man and woman. But it allowed priests to offer spontaneous blessings to same-sex couples seeking God\u2019s grace, provided such blessings aren\u2019t confused with the rites of a wedding.",
      "Frances later acknowledged the declaration had encountered resistance; he faulted opposing bishops for refusing to open a dialogue about it.",
      "\u201cSometimes decisions are not accepted,\" he said in a TV interview. \"But in most cases, when you don\u2019t accept a decision, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis has happened with these last decisions about blessing everyone,\u201d Francis added. \u201cThe Lord blesses everyone.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries of Francis' welcoming attitude included a community of transgender women \u2014 many of them Latin American migrants who worked in Rome as prostitutes \u2014 who visited his weekly general audiences and were given VIP seats.",
      "\u201cBefore, the church was closed to us. They didn\u2019t see us as normal people. They saw us as the devil,\u201d said Colombia-born Andrea Paola Torres Lopez. \u201cThen Pope Francis arrived, and the doors of the church opened for us.\u201d",
      "The pope\u2019s mixed legacy was epitomized by the Vatican\u2019s 2023 synod bringing together hundreds of bishops and lay people to discuss the church's future. The advance agenda mentioned LGBTQ+ issues; one of Francis\u2019 hand-picked delegates was the Rev. James Martin, a U.S.-based Jesuit and prominent advocate of greater LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "Yet in the final summary of the three-week synod, there was no mention of LGBTQ+ people \u2014 reflecting the influence of conservatives who opposed Francis\u2019 overtures to that community.",
      "During the synod, the pope met with a small delegation from the Maryland-based New Ways Ministry, which advocates on behalf of LGBTQ+ Catholics in the U.S.",
      "According to the group\u2019s executive director, Francis DeBernardo, the pope urged them never to lose hope \u2014 a message DeBernardo repeated after being disappointed by the synod\u2019s outcome.",
      "\u201cThe Catholic LGBTQ+ community must take Pope Francis\u2019 message to heart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe report\u2019s shortcomings are an invitation to speak anew about their joys, their sorrows, and their faith. \u2026 Now is not a time to despair.\u201d",
      "Another disappointment came in May 2024, when Francis apologized after Italian media quoted unnamed bishops saying he jokingly used the vulgar term \u201cfaggotness\u201d while speaking in Italian during a meeting. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican\u2019s ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.",
      "This week, DeBernardo looked back at Francis\u2019 legacy mostly with appreciation, even while acknowledging disappointments.",
      "\u201cFrancis was not only the first pope to use the word 'gay\u2019 when speaking about LGBTQ+ people, he was the first pope to speak lovingly and tenderly to them,\u201d DeBernardo wrote. \u201cHis kind words of welcome to this community, traditionally marginalized in the church, rang loudly around the globe.\u201d",
      "It became clear early in Francis\u2019 papacy that he was going to articulate a gentler, more tolerant approach to LGBTQ+ people than any previous pope. The initial high-profile moment came in 2013 -\u2013 during the first airborne news conference of his pontificate \u2014 with his memorable \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment when he was asked about a purportedly gay priest.",
      "Signals had come earlier. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, he had favored granting legal protections to same-sex couples. After becoming pope, he went on to minister repeatedly and publicly to the gay and transgender communities, steadily evolving his position. His abiding message: \u201cEveryone, everyone, everyone\u201d \u2014 \u201ctodos, todos, todos\u201d \u2014 is loved by God and should be welcomed in the church.",
      "On some specific LGBTQ+ issues, Francis initially disappointed activists with his decisions, yet later softened or reversed them as part of highlighting his welcoming approach.",
      "Francis was criticized by the Catholic gay community for a 2021 decree from the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office saying the church cannot bless same-sex unions because \u201cGod cannot bless sin.\u201d But that stance was effectively repudiated by the 2023 declaration on blessings.",
      "Another reversal came that year in a Vatican statement saying it\u2019s permissible, under certain circumstances, for transgender people to be baptized and serve as godparents",
      "If it did not cause scandal or \u201cdisorientation\u201d among other Catholics, a transgender person \u201cmay receive baptism under the same conditions as other faithful,\u201d it said.",
      "Similarly, the document said trans adults, even if they had gender-transition surgery, could serve as godparents under certain conditions. That reversed an earlier outright ban.",
      "U.S. transgender-rights advocates welcomed Francis\u2019 inclusive tone, noting that some political and religious leaders were targeting trans people with discriminatory laws and policies.",
      "Another issue tackled by Francis pertained to laws in dozens of countries criminalizing homosexual activity.",
      "In 2008, the Vatican declined to sign a U.N. declaration calling for an end to such laws. But in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, Francis assailed these laws as unjust and called for their elimination.",
      "\u201cBeing homosexual isn\u2019t a crime,\u201d Francis said.",
      "Francis acknowledged that Catholic bishops in some regions support laws that criminalize homosexuality or discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. But he attributed such attitudes to cultural backgrounds, and said bishops need to recognize the dignity of everyone.",
      "\u201cThese bishops have to have a process of conversion,\u201d he said, suggesting they should apply \u201ctenderness, please, as God has for each one of us.\u201d",
      "Advocates of greater LGBTQ+ inclusion hailed Francis\u2019 comments.",
      "\u201cHis historic statement should send a message to world leaders and millions of Catholics around the world: LGBTQ people deserve to live in a world without violence and condemnation, and more kindness and understanding,\u201d said Ellis, the head of GLAAD.",
      "Praise also came from Martin, who was selected by Francis as a synod delegate.",
      "\u201cFew bishops or bishops\u2019 conferences have condemned the criminalizing laws that the pope rejected today,\u201d he wrote of the AP interview.",
      "But Jamie Manson, a lesbian who headed the U.S.-based abortion-rights group Catholics for Choice, insisted declarations were not enough.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- So many mourners lined up to see Pope Francis lying in state in a simple wooden coffin inside St. Peter\u2019s Basilica that the Vatican kept the doors open all night due to higher-than-expected turnout, closing the basilica for just an hour Thursday morning for cleaning.",
      "The basilica is bathed in a hushed silence as mourners from across the globe make a slow, shuffling procession up the main aisle to pay their last respects to Francis, who died Monday after a stroke.",
      "The hours spent on line up the stately via della Conciliazione through St. Peter's Square and through the Holy Door into the basilica has allowed mourners to find community around the Argentine pontiff's legacy of inclusion and humble persona.",
      "Emiliano Fernandez, a Catholic from Mexico, was waiting in line around midnight, and after two hours still had not reached the basilica.",
      "\u201cI don't even care how much time I wait here. It's just the opportunity to (show) how I admired Francisco in his life,'' said Fernandez, whose admiration for the pope grew during his 2016 visit to Mexico. \"I think because of the respect that I have for him and the great person he was, it\u2019s worth the wait.\u201d",
      "The last numbers released by the Vatican said more than 20,000 people had paid their respects during the first 8 \u00bd hours of the public viewing on Wednesday. The basilica closed for just one hour Thursday morning, from 6 a.m. until 7 a.m., the planned opening time.",
      "Among the first-day mourners was a church group of 14-year-olds from near Milan who arrived for the now-suspended canonization of the first millennial saint, as well as a woman who prayed to the pope for a successful operation and an Italian family who brought their small children to see the pope\u2019s body.",
      "\u201cWe came because we didn\u2019t bring them when he was alive, so we thought we would bring them for a final farewell,\u2019\u2019 said Rosa Scorpati, who was exiting the basilica Wednesday with her three children in strollers. \u201cThey were good, but I don\u2019t think they really understood because they haven\u2019t yet had to deal with death.\u201d",
      "Like many others, the Scorpati family from Calabria was in Rome on an Easter vacation, only to be met with the news of Francis\u2019 death on Easter Monday.",
      "Out of devotion to the pope and his message of inclusion, the grieving faithful joined the procession of mourners that wended from St. Peter\u2019s Square through the basilica's Holy Door, with the repentant among them winning an indulgence, a form of atonement granted during the Jubilee Holy Year. From there, the line extended down the basilica\u2019s central aisle to the pope\u2019s simple wooden casket.",
      "By late Wednesday, the wait appeared to be three or four hours and growing. A person doing crowd management estimated that the wait was closer to five hours. The mourners stretched down the center of Via della Conciliazione, in a lane set aside for Jubilee pilgrims.",
      "After three days of public viewing, a funeral Mass including heads of state will be held Saturday in St. Peter's Square. The pope will then be buried in a niche within the St. Mary Major Basilica, near his favorite Madonna icon.",
      "The death of Francis, who was 88, capped a 12-year pontificate characterized by his concern for the poor and his message of inclusion, but he was also criticized by some conservatives who felt alienated by his progressive outlook.",
      "A procession of priests, bishops and cardinals accompanied Francis\u2019 body Wednesday on its journey from a private viewing inside the Vatican to St. Peter\u2019s Square. The pageantry contrasted with the human interactions of rank-and-file mourners at the public viewing.",
      "Francis lay in state in an open casket, perched on a ramp facing mourners, with four Swiss Guards standing at attention. As the crowd reached the casket, many lifted their smartphones to snap a photo.",
      "One nun accompanying an elderly woman with a cane walked away sobbing, \u201cMy pope is gone.\u2019\u2019",
      "Such despair was rare. The mood was more one of gratitude for a pope who had, by example, taught many people to open their minds.",
      "\u201cI am very devoted to the pope,'' said Ivenes Bianco, who was in Rome from Brindisi, Italy, for an operation. \u201dHe was important to me because he brought many people together by encouraging coexistence.''

      "The owner of a popular nightclub in the Dominican Republic whose roof collapsed and killed 232 people this month said it had filtration problems for decades and had been repeatedly fixed with plasterboard",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A roof that collapsed at a popular nightclub in the Dominican Republic and killed 232 people this month had filtration problems for decades and had been repeatedly fixed with plasterboard, according to its owner.",
      "Antonio Espaillat, who also serves as manager of the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, spoke with local TV station Telesistema on Wednesday in his first interview since the April 8 disaster.",
      "Espaillat told a reporter with El D\u00eda news program that employees had added new plasterboard to the roof hours before the collapse.",
      "He noted that plasterboard had fallen repeatedly throughout the years for reasons including water that filtered through the club\u2019s air conditioning units. However, Espaillat said no one ever inspected the roof or water filtrations.",
      "\u201cWe always bought plasterboard. Always,\u201d said Espaillat, who spoke in a subdued manner throughout the nearly one-hour interview.",
      "A spokeswoman for Espaillat did not return a message for comment seeking an interview with him.",
      "Espaillat said he learned about the collapse when his sister called him from underneath the debris, trapped along with hundreds of others attending a concert by beloved merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, who was among those killed.",
      "\u201cTo the families of the victims, I want to say I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m very sorry,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cI am completely destroyed.\u201d",
      "Espaillat said he was 6 years old when his mother founded the legendary club 52 years ago. The club later moved to a space occupied by a shuttered movie theater and remained in that location for 30 years until the collapse.",
      "He said there were six air-conditioning units on the roof, plus three water tanks. An electric plant was installed in an adjacent room, not on the roof, he added.",
      "Every six to eight years, a specialized crew would waterproof the roof, with the last waterproofing done about a month before the collapse, he said.",
      "The heavy woofers that boomed music at Jet Set, known for its merengue parties held every Monday, were on the floor, he said.",
      "Espaillat said if there was something he could have done to avoid the collapse, he would have done it.",
      "\u201cThere was no warning, nothing. We were all surprised,\u201d he said.",
      "The Dominican government has created a committee that includes local and international experts tasked with investigating the collapse.",
      "About 515 people were at Jet Set when the roof fell on the crowd, according to Espaillat.",
      "In the 53 hours following the disaster, crews rescued 189 survivors. Dozens of others were hospitalized.",
      "The 232 victims include seven doctors; a retired U.N. official; former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera; and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz,",
      "At least three lawsuits have been filed.",
      "Espaillat, who said he usually attended Jet Set's Monday merengue parties, was in Las Vegas for a convention when his sister called.",
      "\u201cHow can a roof collapse?\u201d he recalled wondering as he flew back to the Dominican Republic.",
      "Espaillat said he did not immediately visit the site upon arriving because officials worried about his safety, noting that people at the scene were angry.",
      "He said he hasn\u2019t slept much since the disaster, and that he has talked to the families of his employees and some of the victim's relatives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to face everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d",
      "The investigation into what caused the collapse could take a couple of months and has raised questions about the safety of infrastructure across Santo Domingo and beyond.",
      "There is currently no government agency tasked with inspecting the buildings of private businesses in the Dominican Republic, although President Luis Abinader announced last week that new legislation is expected to change that.",
      "Yamil Castillo, a structural engineer and vice president of the Society of Engineers of Puerto Rico, said water leaks can be extremely damaging and should be taken care of immediately.",
      "Castillo, who is not involved in investigating the collapse, warned that water seeping into the different materials that compose a roof can weigh it down, in addition to whatever else is placed on the roof, including air conditioning units.",
      "Salty air also cause corrosion and roof damage, he said.",
      "\u201cThose leaks should have been fixed,\" Castillo said, adding that replacing the plasterboard was not enough.",

      "Attorney General Consuelo Porras has been the focus of much of that ire as she has refused to step down or halt her investigations into Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s party. The U.S. government has sanctioned her for allegedly impeding corruption investigations.",
      "Ar\u00e9valo said later Wednesday that the arrest was unfounded and \u201cspurious\u201d and \u201ccriminalizes principles and rights that are guaranteed.\u201d",
      "Attorney Francisco Vivar said that federal agents had denied them access to the home where Pacheco was arrested and they had not seen him since his arrest.",
      "Pacheco, a member of the K\u2019iche\u2019 people, said at the time that the galvanizing moment for the community he represented was a raid on electoral offices broadcast live in which federal agents opened and took away \u2014 despite resistance from some electoral officials \u2014 boxes containing precinct vote tally sheets. \u201cThe people already voted and you have to respect the decision taken,\u201d he said then.",

      "Belgian nationals Lornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx, both 19 years old, were arrested on April 5 with 5,000 ants at a guest house. They were charged on April 15 with violating wildlife conservation laws.",
      "The teens have told the magistrate that they didn\u2019t know that keeping the ants was illegal and were just having fun.",

Authorities condemned the behavior and have issued warnings not to approach the sharks. Swimming is banned at the beach, but bathers enter the water regardless.",

      "Since taking office again, Trump has falsely claimed Ukraine \u201cshould have never started the war,\u201d said Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian some day\u201d and questioned the legitimacy of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government.

      "LONDON -- A set of the first four editions of William Shakespeare\u2019s collected works is expected to sell for up to 4.5 million pounds ($6 million) at auction next month.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s auction house announced the sale on Wednesday, Shakespeare's 461st birthday. It said the May 23 sale will be the first time since 1989 that a set of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Folios has been offered at auction as a single lot.",
      "The auction house estimated the sale price at between 3.5 million and 4.5 million pounds.",
      "After Shakespeare\u2019s death in 1616, his plays were collected into a single volume by his friends John Heminges and Henry Condell, actors and shareholders in the playwright\u2019s troupe, the King\u2019s Men.",
      "The First Folio \u2014 fully titled \u201cMr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories & Tragedies\u201d \u2014 contained 36 plays, of which half were published there for the first time.

      "About 750 copies were printed in 1623, of which about 230 are known to survive. All but a few are in museums, universities or libraries. One of the few First Folios in private hands sold for $9.9 million at an auction in 2020.",
      "The First Folio proved successful enough that a an updated edition, the Second Folio, was published in 1632, a third in 1663 and a fourth in 1685.",
      "Although the First Folio is regarded as the most valuable, the third is the rarest, with 182 copies known to survive. It is believed the third book\u2019s rarity is because some of the stock was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.",
      "The Third Folio included seven additional plays, but only one \u2013 \u201cPericles, Prince of Tyre\u201d \u2013 is believed to be by Shakespeare.",

      "The German government is forecasting the country\u2019s economy, Europe\u2019s biggest, will stagnate this year as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance",
      "BERLIN -- The German government forecast Thursday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, will stagnate this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance following months of political uncertainty.",
      "Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the government cut its 2025 outlook to zero from the modest growth of 0.3% it predicted at the end of January. For next year, it is forecasting growth of 1%, slightly lower than the 1.1% it predicted three months ago.",
      "\u201cThere is above all one reason for this, namely Donald Trump's trade policy and the effects of the trade policy on Germany,\u201d Habeck told reporters in Berlin. He noted that Germany also hasn't had a government with a parliamentary majority to set policy since early November, and the new government isn't yet in place after an election in February.",
      "Germany hasn\u2019t seen significant economic growth in five years. The country for years expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars.",
      "But it\u2019s suffered from increasing competition from Chinese companies, along with many other factors, and the economy contracted in each of the last two years.",
      "Trump's tariffs have added a further risk to German exports. Last year, the United States was Germany\u2019s biggest single trading partner for the first time since 2015, displacing China from the top spot as exports to the Asian power declined.",
      "The German parliament plans to meet on May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the country\u2019s next leader, if all the parties in his proposed government approve a coalition agreement reached earlier this month.",
      "Last month already, the prospective partners pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that\u2019s aimed at boosting the economy.",

    "story": [
      "A new AP-NORC poll suggests Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president\u2019s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.",
      "Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump\u2019s trade policies will increase prices \u201ca lot\u201d and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up \u201csomewhat,\u201d according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.",
      "While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn\u2019t mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.",
      "Three months into his second term, Trump\u2019s handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That\u2019s roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Matthew Wood, 41, said he\u2019s waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he\u2019s feeling anxious.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,\u201d said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. \u201cPersonally, it hasn\u2019t affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don\u2019t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.\u201d",
      "Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump\u2019s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he\u2019s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That\u2019s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn\u2019t previously have an opinion on tariffs.",
      "Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.",
      "\u201cActually, I think he shouldn\u2019t have suspended it,\u201d said Manis, a retired sheriff\u2019s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. \u201cBecause now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.\u201d",
      "Not quite 100 days into Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.",
      "Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He\u2019s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes \u2014 albeit partially suspending some of them \u2014 launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump\u2019s tariff pronouncements.",
      "Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.",
      "Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.",
      "Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not \u201csustainable.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want \u2014 a sign of the economy\u2019s resilience so far.",
      "Retirement savings are a source of anxiety \u2014 about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a \u201cmajor source\u201d of stress in their lives. But fewer \u2014 only about 2 in 10 \u2014 identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.",
      "\u201cThis whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,\u201d said Nicole Jones, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge \u2014 and everybody\u2019s losing on it.\u201d",
      "The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn\u2019t given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.",
      "\u201cThings are more expensive for us,\u201d she said.",
      "And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.",
      "The difference is that Republicans \u2014 who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president \u2014 now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country\u2019s financial future.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,\u201d Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump\u2019s policies went into effect.",

      "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t expect the U.S. trade war with China to forestall the company's financial recovery, nor prevent it from reaching aircraft delivery targets with Chinese airlines now refusing to accept Boeing planes.",
      "Speaking on CNBC, Ortberg said that Boeing had three airplanes in China ready for delivery, but that two of them had been returned to Seattle so far because Beijing has stopped taking deliveries due to the dispute with the U.S.",

      "President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The height of tax season was the height of turmoil at the IRS.",
      "The agency shuffled through three acting directors over the course of a week. It\u2019s preparing to lose tens of thousands of workers to layoffs and voluntary retirements. And President Donald Trump is weighing in on which nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status, an incursion into the agency\u2019s typically apolitical stance that threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.",
      "Just three months into Trump's second term, the government's fly-under-the-radar tax collector has become the latest platform for the Republican administration\u2019s vision to cut and control the federal bureaucracy. Tax policy experts fear that taxpayer services and collection efforts will face prolonged delays as a result of the rapid changes.",
      "The quick turnover in leadership and other changes are likely to dampen employee morale at the IRS and hurt the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers in a timely manner, says Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cLeadership sets the tone, particularly in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Already, she notes, the agency has lost decades of institutional knowledge from nonpartisan career civil servants who have left over policy disagreements and layoffs.",
      "The upheaval unfolded as Americans dutifully filed their taxes ahead of the April 15 deadline and as a legion of IRS employees undertook work to process returns and dole out refunds. The latest filing season data shows the agency accepted more than 117 million returns this tax season and issued $228.7 billion in refunds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to improving the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service,\" said the agency's newest acting commissioner, Michael Faulkender. \"For the last 35 years, we\u2019ve been five years away from the IRS being modernized. Under the direct leadership of Treasury, the modernization will be done in two years at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS, like other federal agencies, is hemorrhaging employees over cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, all while the agency churns through acting leaders as it awaits the installation of a permanent leader.",
      "Douglas O'Donnell, the Trump administration's first acting IRS commissioner, announced his retirement in February as furor spread over DOGE gaining access to IRS taxpayer data. Melanie Krause, the second acting commissioner, resigned early this month over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Gary Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who testified publicly about investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, was acting commissioner for a matter of days before being replaced by Faulkender, who was elevated just last week. The New York Times reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had complained to Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's nominee for IRS commissioner, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, is still waiting for a confirmation hearing but faces controversies of his own. Most recently, Senate Democrats have called for a criminal investigation into Long's connections to alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. Long did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Among other concerns at the agency are fears that Trump will weaponize the IRS against his enemies \u2014 and reward his friends.",
      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions, including fundraising platform ActBlue and the protest group Indivisible, are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "Trump said last week at the White House that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, which has defied the government's attempts to limit activism on campus, and environmental groups. He also mentioned the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said of CREW. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Jonathan S. Masur, an administrative law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said it's unlawful for the president to unilaterally take away organizations' tax-exempt status.",
      "\u201cIt's illegal for starters. The Supreme Court has established that that step is not allowed,\u201d he said, adding that he anticipates that the court system will \u201cvery quickly block\u201d any such move from the president.",
      "The Trump administration is also watching out for allies of the president.",
      "Treasury official David Eisner sent an email in March to a top IRS official regarding Mike Lindell, the founder of MyPillow and one of the chief proponents of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018My Pillow guy\u2019 and a high-profile friend of the President recently received an audit letter, from what I understand, his second in two years,\u201d Eisner wrote in the email, which was viewed by the AP. The president \u201cis concerned that he may have been inappropriately targeted,\" Eisner wrote.",
      "Among other changes in recent weeks are concerns about the IRS' engagement with the Department of Homeland Security over enforcing a new data-sharing agreement signed earlier this month by Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",
      "That agreement is being litigated in federal court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich will soon decide whether to refuse or grant a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups. The groups argue that immigrants in the country illegally who pay taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens and immigrants who are legally in the country.",
      "The Treasury Department says the agreement will help carry out Trump\u2019s agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids and the use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Holtzblatt said the agreement is indicative of the turmoil at the IRS.",
      "\u201cThere's an emphasis on improving technology and sharing information,\" but it's unclear for what reason, she said.",

      "This year's show in the sprawling industrial outskirts of Shanghai comes at a pivotal moment. Three decades after Beijing set out to build a world-class auto industry, local manufacturers account for about two-thirds of sales inside China, and a growing share of global exports.",
      "But with U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and the European Union slapping duties on Chinese electric vehicles, selling to some overseas markets is growing increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cGeopolitics are very complex and the situation remains uncertain,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motors, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut Great Wall is always exploring investments in overseas markets.\u201d",

      "A total of 31.4 million vehicles including buses and trucks were sold last year in the world\u2019s biggest market by sales, up 4.5% compared to a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported.",
      "Growth in sales of EVs was offset by falling sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, which still accounted for just over half of new car sales.",
      "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD nudged past Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of EVs by sales last year, reporting revenue of over $100 billion. It recently announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about the time needed to fill up at the pump. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "To gain access to China's potentially huge market, foreign automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW and Ford set up joint ventures with state-owned local companies beginning in the 1980s and '90s, helping them build the capacity and technology to compete on a world scale.",
      "They also created sprawling supply chains in Shanghai and other major manufacturing hubs, helping to nurture other big names in Chinese automaking, such as BYD, Geely and Great Wall Motors.",
      "With growth at home limited by brutal competition, they're expanding rapidly especially in Southeast Asia and other developing economies with relatively affordable sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks.",
      "Shanghai\u2019s auto show is a gathering for the \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d said Zhou Lijun, director and chief researcher of the industry analysis group Yiche Research Institute.",
      "That doesn't mean all the EV makers go it alone. BYD teamed up with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group, to launch its Denza premium brand. It's also challenging Toyota and other top tier brands with its luxury Yangwang brand, priced at up to 2 million yuan ($280,000)",
      "Opening markets wider to foreign competition has given car buyers a choice of more affordable, innovative vehicles. That's a mixed blessing for older automakers like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW that are also fighting a battle of attrition in China.",
      "\u201cChina is still a market worth fighting for,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW Group, which like other automakers highlighted a \u201cIn China, for China,\u201d approach, at \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "Overhanging the upbeat talk in Shanghai by both Chinese and foreign automakers of manufacturing in China for the world are Trump's tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, despite a 90-day pause that has spared many other countries, and 25% U.S. tax on imported cars and auto parts.",
      "Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s head of China operations, Stephen Ma, said the company plans to make 10 new battery electric or hybrid models by 2027 in China, for China and for \u201cexport to the world, except one country \u2014 you can guess which one.\"",

      "\u201cThe trade war between China and the United States has blocked direct exports from China to the United States, but it hasn't blocked local production there or the establishment of global production bases in Europe or elsewhere,\" Zhou said.",
      "A report by the Rhodium Group shows that nearly half the world's markets are restricting imports from China, in part because of national security concerns linked to the advanced electronics in EVs and other high-tech vehicles. A minority of countries like Australia and South Africa remain relatively open, and Russia is a major market but is nearly saturated, it says.",
      "Chinese automakers lag behind global leaders like Toyota in conventional gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, but they can sell EVs at roughly the same price, while also solving the problems of range and fast charging.",
      "China has become part of what geopolitical analyst Yanmei Xie described as a \u201ctechnological paradigm shift\u201d in a commentary in the Japanese financial publication Nikkei Asia. Automakers in China are going electric not just because of the green transition, but as a route to \u201ctechnological and industrial dominance,\u201d she wrote.",

      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports has revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport",
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports, prompted by the deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the potential for a collision between air tour helicopters and planes at Harry Reid International Airport led the agency to make immediate changes to flying rules. In the first three weeks after implementation the number of collision alerts for planes dropped 30%.",
      "The FAA said after the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January, which killed 67 people, that it planned to use artificial intelligence to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic, including Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The FAA\u2019s acting administrator, Chris Rocheleau, said Las Vegas quickly became a concern once the agency dug into the data because agreements with helicopter operators there didn\u2019t clearly define vertical and lateral separation requirements when helicopters were approaching the airport. And air traffic controllers in the tower weren\u2019t issuing traffic advisories between returning helicopters and airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe took quick action including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots,\u201d Rocheleau said. He promised to take additional actions in Las Vegas and at other airports where the FAA identifies concerns.",
      "Luke Nimmo, a spokesperson for Clark County Department of Aviation, referred all questions about the findings to the FAA.",
      "Following the crash of a New York City sightseeing helicopter into the Hudson River that killed six people April 10, the FAA said it was establishing a rulemaking committee to develop recommendations for improving commercial air tour safety.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former National Transportation Safety Board and FAA accident investigator, said the fact that collision alerts for planes dropped so quickly \u201cindicates a real hazard existed before the FAA looked at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to characterize how significant the hazard was,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet another hole in the Swiss cheese that can line up with other holes and cause an accident just like what happened in Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "He said it made sense that the FAA first addressed the Las Vegas airport, given its large mix of helicopters and commercial traffic.",
      "\u201cI think that they will find issues at other airports, but maybe not to the degree that they found with this one,\u201d Guzzetti added.",
      "Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said there have long been safety issues with the helicopter tour industry, describing it as slipping in many cases into \u201cbecoming an attraction rather than a safe ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately in aviation, it is accidents that bring the attention of the regulators to their responsibilities,\" he added.",
      "The January midair collision near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport was the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since 2001. A series of other crashes and near misses in the months since have raised worries about air travel, even though it remains safe overall.",
      "Helicopters have been a key concern, but Rocheleau said the core safety issues remain operations and maintenance problems. He said the top causes of helicopter accidents include loss of control and striking an object during low-altitude operations.",
      "The FAA said its review of the safety data has expanded beyond helicopters to look at airports with a mix of many different planes and airports that are close together.",
      "The proximity between Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles area emerged as a concern because they are less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. Both airports serve a wide mix of aircraft and have arrival and departure paths that are close.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hollywood Burbank Airport referred questions to the FAA. The Van Nuys Airport didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "\u201cWhile flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cWe have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.\u201d",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents several families of victims of the D.C. plane crash, praised the FAA for taking action to make helicopter flights safer.",
      "\u201cAs a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" he said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\u201d",

      "The outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the uncertainty they have created",
      "WASHINGTON -- The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.",
      "The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.",
      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

      "Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear",
      "Bottles and bags, food wrappers and straws. Piping, packaging, toys and trays. Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear.",
      "A typical closet is loaded with plastic, woven into polyester activewear, acrylic sweaters, nylon swimsuits and stretchy socks \u2014 and it\u2019s shedding into the environment nonstop.",
      "When garments are worn, washed and put through the dryer, they shed plastic fiber fragments. A single load of laundry can release millions that are so tiny wastewater treatment plants can\u2019t capture them all. They wind up in local waterways that connect to the ocean. Marine animals eat them, and that can pass plastic to larger animals and humans.",
      "Even natural fabrics shed fibers and have chemicals that can leach into the environment. But polyester is the most widely used fiber on Earth, and along with other synthetic fibers accounts for about two-thirds of production worldwide.",
      "Tuesday is Earth Day, when people worldwide contemplate ways to reduce their impact on the planet.",
      "\u201cEveryone who wears and launders clothing is part of this problem but everyone who wears and launders clothing can be part of the solutions,\u201d said Rachael Z. Miller, founder of Vermont-based Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean.",
      "Simple changes like washing clothes less and using cold water instead of hot can help reduce the shedding of fibers. More challenging is that textiles need to be produced and used in a more sustainable way, said Elisa Tonda at the UN Environment Programme. For example, designing clothes that shed fewer microfibers and are high-quality to last longer, said Tonda, who leads the resources and markets branch.",
      "The easiest solution is to wash clothes less often, making for less of the friction that breaks fibers apart, said Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy.",
      "\u201cThey get tumbled and tossed around with a bunch of soaps, really designed to shake things up to get out dirt and stains,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Miller uses a stain stick to spot-clean. Both say that when clothes are washed, they shed less when put in cold water in full loads to reduce friction, on a shorter cycle, then hung to dry.",
      "Inspired by the way coral filters the ocean, Miller invented the Cora Ball, a laundry ball that can be tossed into the washer to cut down on clothes banging into each other. It also catches microfibers. (A portion of the proceeds goes to the Rozalia Project.) Another option is to put synthetic fabrics in a washing bag that captures fibers.",
      "Which clothes shed the most? To find out, press a strip of clear packing tape to a garment, then stick it to white paper to check for fibers, Miller said. Garments that are loosely knit or woven tend to shed more, such as fleece.",
      "Miller said people don't need to rush to throw out clothing that's more likely to shed. She owns fleece jackets herself. Instead, she suggested such clothing can be worn indoors only or outside with a layer on top, and it's worth thinking twice about acquiring more garments like that.",
      "\u201cI try not to guilt or panic people because a lot of this information is very new,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd so we might as well just say, \u2018OK, I got it. How can I be strategic about what I\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d",
      "Filters can be added to washers to capture microfibers. Samsung Electronics collaborated with Patagonia and the global conservation organization Ocean Wise to launch one in 2023. It's now sold in more than 20 countries for front-load washers. Bosch recently launched a microfiber filter in Europe for washers.",
      "France was first to adopt a law to mandate that new washing machines sold in the country have a microfiber filter, though implementation has been delayed.",
      "In the U.S., efforts to mandate filters in states have failed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill in 2023, saying he was concerned about the cost to consumers and he wants to incentivize, not mandate, technologies to remove microfibers in wastewater. In Oregon, state Sen. Deb Patterson proposed a bill this year requiring microfiber filters on new washers sold in that state after she came across the technology in Canada. Patterson said the bill doesn't have enough support yet but she'll keep trying.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers opposes the proposals, saying it's concerned about consumer costs and filter effectiveness.",
      "Some big brands are testing their fabrics to help researchers understand fiber fragmentation, including Adidas, Nike, Patagonia and Under Armour.",
      "They're among more than 90 brands, retailers and manufacturers to partner with The Microfibre Consortium in the United Kingdom, founded in 2018 to do research and offer solutions to transform textile production \u2014 including reducing fiber breakup.",
      "Nearly 1,500 fabrics have been tested. None are the same, making it a tough problem to solve, consortium CEO Kelly Sheridan said.",
      "Patagonia has been a leader in trying to stop the spread of synthetic fiber waste into air and water, saying it's up to garment brands to prevent it at the source since cleaning up microplastics in the environment is not yet possible.",
      "It paid for its own research starting a decade ago on the implication of its clothes. The company worked with suppliers to choose fabrics and dyes and to finish their clothing in ways that reduce shedding. They collaborated on new filtration technologies for washers, textile mills and municipal systems.",
      "One of their best-known styles is something called the \u201cbetter sweater\" that shifts from virgin polyester to recycled polyester to cut shedding by about 40%, said Matt Dwyer, vice president of global product footprint. And at textile mills, there's a prewash at the factory that can capture that first big shed, he added.",
      "Dwyer is optimistic about progress.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of smart people, not just understanding the problem and the scope of the problem, but also looking for solutions all the way through the manufacturing cycle and use phase,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to 10 years ago, it\u2019s a whole new world.\u201d",

      "Monday's extraordinary hearing was the culmination of over two years of investigation by the Senate that began when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion.",
      "That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn't balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousands of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grew to $1.8 billion.",
      "It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the money was not real cash but just an accumulation of errors.",
      "Two Republican senators led the call for Loftis to be kicked out of office, saying he can no longer be trusted to handle South Carolina's bank accounts.

      "Senators followed the presentation with their own questions. Most of the eight senators asked Loftis directly why he didn't take responsibility for the error and why he let others inform the Senate. Loftis said that was the responsibility of other officials.",
      "\u201cIt's everybody but me. And maybe that's so, but it is so hard to defend ... in a \u2018can he do the job' (sense),\" Republican Sen. Luke Rankin told Loftis. \u201cHelp me, help us. Accept the responsibility.\"",
      "\u201cWould you tell me what you want me to take responsibility for, because it is complicated,\u201d Loftis replied.",
      "Loftis has called the Senate investigation a witch hunt. He repeatedly said no money went missing and the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state's strong credit rating.",
      "Loftis' lawyers opened the treasurer's case with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump. They compared the hearing to coups in Zimbabwe and Myanmar that threw out elected officials and said Loftis' real judges should be the voters in the Republican primary in 14 months. Loftis said he is now running for reelection after testifying to senators this would be his last term.",
      "Fellow lawyer Johnny Gasser reminded the 34 Republicans in the 46-member Senate that nearly every vote cast for them also was a vote for Loftis.",
      "\u201cDo you really want to go down this path?\u201d Gasser asked.",
      "Eight Republicans voted against removing Loftis, with the rest of the Senate finding Loftis committed \u201cwillful neglect of duty.\" They sent the matter to the House, which must also hold its own two-thirds vote to remove the treasurer.",

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance has arrived in India for a four-day visit as New Delhi looks to avoid U.S. tariffs and negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington",
      "NEW DELHI -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in India on Monday for a four-day visit as New Delhi looks to avoid U.S. tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington and strengthen ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the first day of his largely personal visit. The two leaders are expected to hold discussions on bilateral ties outlined in February when Modi met President Donald Trump in Washington.",
      "The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aiming to seal a bilateral trade agreement this year.",
      "They have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "Vance\u2019s first visit to New Delhi comes amid the backdrop of Trump's now-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "Modi and Vance are expected to \u201creview the progress in bilateral relations\u201d and \u201cexchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,\u201d India\u2019s Foreign Ministry said last week.",
      "\u201cWe are very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties,\u201d spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.",
      "Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi\u2019s Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome, where he met Pope Francis on Easter Sunday. He is accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their children and officials from the U.S. administration.",
      "The couple and their three young children visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort \u2014 a UNESCO world heritage site \u2014 during their trip.",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It is also part of the Quad, which is comprised of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China\u2019s expansion in the region. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \u201cmega partnership\u201d with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration\u2019s demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",
      "Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a \u201ctariff abuser\u201d and \u201ctariff king.\u201d",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors.",

    "story": [
      "Stores selling secondhand clothing, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s trade war even as global businesses race to avoid potential damage",
      "NEW YORK -- Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from President Donald Trump'strade war even as businesses the world over race to avert potential damage, according to industry experts.",
      "American styles carry international influence, but nearly all of the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs \"disproportionately affect\u201d those goods.",
      "Such price hikes may drive cost-conscious shoppers to online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country.",
      "\u201cI think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,\u201d said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. \u201cWhat I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.\u201d",
      "The outlook for preowned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president's tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It's also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand.",
      "Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites.",
      "\u201cUntil I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can\u2019t say exclusively that I\u2019ll be pushed into another direction,\u201d Genovese, 75, said. \u201cI think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.\u201d",
      "The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted after the COVID-19 pandemic that global revenue from preowned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in a more environmentally conscious way.",
      "While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower shows the audience may be expanding.",
      "The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces the firm tracks \u2014 eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist, Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted \u2014 increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said.",
      "The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiled since-paused punitive tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Circana\u2019s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusual vintage pieces to supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items.",
      "\"It's still a cheaper option\u201d than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said.",
      "Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell preowned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said.",
      "Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will \u201cpay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market\u201d from the tariffs, Chandra said.",
      "Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said.",
      "\"Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people\u2019s closets or in warehouses not being used,\u201d offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty,\u201d Gittins said. \u201cEveryone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone\u2019s head is going.\"",
      "Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains and department stores because they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S.",
      "Still, resale vendors aren't immune from tariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry's environmental impact.",
      "U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said.",
      "A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trump already ended the duty-free provision for low-value parcels from China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by making low-priced Chinese fashions pricier, she said.",
      "James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the \u201cde minimis\u201d provision and the 145% tariff Trump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands.",
      "\u201cBrands will explore this and they may do more, but I don\u2019t see them massively changing their operations,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don\u2019t think resale helps you survive.\u201d",
      "Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said.",
      "Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel's 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said.",
      "\u201cThat has nothing to do with the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are feeling priced out.\u201d",
      "Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop.",
      "If tariffs upend the economics of fast fashion and discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus.",
      "\u201cI would love if this would steer people in a different direction,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Removing lanes to slow down speeding drivers is a long-embraced strategy for improving safety on city streets",
      "A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away.",
      "Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing the damage caused by vehicles speeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways.",
      "\u201cA wide road makes people think, \u2018We\u2019ll just drive as fast as we want on it,'\" said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above.",
      "When concrete sidewalk barriers didn\u2019t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a \u201croad diet.\"",
      "Removing lanes has been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. President Donald Trump's administration doesn't like it either.",
      "Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round of road safety grants say projects aimed at \u201creducing lane capacity\u201d should be considered \u201cless favorably,\" the administration said.",
      "Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces \u201ccan lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,\u201d the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe update reflects the Department\u2019s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.\u201d",
      "Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, better pedestrian crossings and protected on-street parking spaces.",
      "Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years, federal guidelines said lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city's four-lane roads don't meet that threshold.",
      "Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City's road diets, calls the strategy \"a smashing success\" and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries.",
      "\u201cIn the architectural world you\u2019d call it environmental determinism,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou want to make it so they don\u2019t feel comfortable going too fast. You\u2019re really not slowing them down. You\u2019re bringing them back to the speed limit.\u201d",
      "Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety.",
      "Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months.",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said.",
      "\u201cThose cars have to go somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are like water. They seek their own level.\u201d",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn't sure if the Trump administration's new guidance will make them reconsider.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,\u201d Shahum said. \u201cThat would be a real loss.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns.",
      "When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass.",
      "Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through.",
      "\u201cThe road diet didn\u2019t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,\u201d she said.",
      "Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states.",
      "San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies.",
      "\u201cThey basically used Broadway as a political football,\u201d said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop.",
      "Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year a 180-day review period and other numerous steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles.",
      "Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan.",
      "Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,\u201d said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. \u201cIt creates more opportunity for conflict.\u201d",
      "Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can't stop all reckless drivers.",
      "\u201cIf you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you\u2019re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,\u201d Evans said.",

      "Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both.",
      "But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money \u2014 and quickly.",
      "Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent.",
      "It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people \u2014 after several years of rebuilding their lives \u2014 back onto the street or back into abusive relationships.",

      "The program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, was allocated $5 billion to help pull people out of homelessness, domestic violence and human trafficking.",
      "People from San Francisco to Dallas to Tallahassee, Florida, were enrolled \u2014 among them children, seniors and veterans \u2014 with the expectation that funding would last until the end of the decade.",
      "But with the ballooning cost of rent, that $5 billion will end far faster.",
      "Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to \"manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.\"",
      "The program's future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it's a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts.",
      "Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who championed the program four years ago, is pushing for another $8 billion infusion.",
      "But the organizations lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers to reup the funding told the AP they aren't optimistic. Four GOP lawmakers who oversee the budget negotiations did not respond to AP requests for comment.",

      "Isolated and in the haze of postpartum depression, she didn\u2019t know what to believe. \u201cEvery day, little by little, I started to feel not like myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like my mind wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d",
      "When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband's urging and he had promised to cover family expenses.",
      "Police reports documenting her husband\u2019s bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said.",
      "But her future was precarious: She was alone, owed thousands of dollars in back rent and had no income to pay it or support her newborn and teenage daughters.",
      "Financial aid to prevent evictions during the pandemic kept Espinal afloat, paying her back rent and keeping the family out of shelters. But it had an expiration date.",

      "DENVER -- Tyler Seguin scored at 5:31 of overtime after Dallas killed a late double-minor penalty, and the Stars beat Colorado 2-1 in Game 3 on Wednesday night in a contest that featured the return of Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog.",
      "Dallas took a 2-1 lead in the first-round series with its second straight overtime victory. The Stars have led for only 1:02 in regulation so far.",
      "Game 4 is Saturday night in Denver.",
      "Seguin knocked the puck past Mackenzie Blackwood off a feed from Mason Marchment. It was Marchment who was sent off for four minutes in the final minute of regulation for a high-stick that caught Brock Nelson in the face.",
      "\u201cWe did a lot of really good things,\u201d Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"Our penalty killing has been one of the best in the league the last three years. We felt confident into the overtime that we could get the job done. And if we did, I think there was a good feeling that we were going to win the game.",
      "\"Knowing Mason and how he was feeling about that penalty, you couldn\u2019t have written a better script for how it ended.\"",
      "Seguin had his second career OT playoff goal. His first was in 2012 with Boston.",
      "\u201cGood feeling,\u201d Seguin said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more tonight than that goal. It\u2019s the penalty kill, it's the details of the game of what the guys did. ... I was just the beneficiary of it. Collectively, just a great road win by the guys.\u201d",
      "Stars defenseman Esa Lindell made a key play in overtime when he deflected a shot by Artturi Lehkonen down low.",
      "Jamie Benn tied it midway through the third period for Dallas. Jake Oettinger stopped 27 shots.",
      "Valeri Nichushkin scored in the first period for Colorado, and Mackenzie Blackwood made 26 saves.",
      "The late score spoiled the return of Landeskog, who was greeted with cheers and chants by the amped-up crowd in his first NHL appearance since June 26, 2022, when he and the Avalanche beat Tampa Bay to capture the Stanley Cup. Landeskog has been sidelined because of a chronically injured right knee.",
      "It was some 1,032 days since his last Avalanche game. He became the fifth player in NHL history \u2014 a minimum of 700 games played \u2014 to return to his team after 1,000 or more days without a contest, according to NHL Stats.",
      "Landeskog played more than 13 minutes and had a team-leading six hits.",
      "\u201cFelt great in all areas tonight in terms of being back,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cVery special night regardless of the outcome.\u201d",
      "The Avalanche finished 0 for 6 on the power play. Asked what needed to better with the skater advantage, Avalanche coach Jared Bednar simply said, \u201ceverything.\u201d",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Pope Francis' beloved soccer club in his native Buenos Aires, San Lorenzo, celebrated a Mass late Wednesday dedicated to its most famous fan two days after his death, with Argentina still awash in emotional tributes to the first Latin American pontiff.",
      "Dozens of San Lorenzo club members sporting club jerseys and clutching rosaries gathered to bid farewell to Pope Francis at the team chapel in the Argentine capital\u2019s middle-class Almagro district \u2014 the same wood-roofed church where another Catholic priest founded the club over a century ago and where Jorge Mario Bergoglio said Mass years before becoming Pope Francis.",
      "Bergoglio attended San Lorenzo matches as a child with his Italian immigrant father and remained an unabashed fan throughout his life, paying monthly club membership fees until his death Monday at the age of 88. Bergoglio grew up in the Flores neighborhood, not far from the San Lorenzo stadium.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not saying goodbye to a fan or the club\u2019s most important fan. Today, many of us are saying goodbye to a friend,\u201d said Father Juan Pablo Sclippa, who presided over the memorial Mass Wednesday from an altar festooned with portraits of the pope. \u201cFrancisco was truly great, the best player on the field, the best player in the world, who never believed in himself.\u201d",
      "The San Lorenzo club \u2014 founded by Father Lorenzo Massa in 1908 as part of an effort to get children off the crime-ridden streets \u2014 became central to Bergoglio\u2019s image as the \u201cPope of the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I read the story of San Lorenzo, everything came together for me,\u201d said Pablo Avalos, 52, a fan at the Mass who credits Francis with inspiring his love of the club. \u201cSan Lorenzo has a lot to do with Francis. It started with Massa\u2019s social action that rescued children from the streets.\u201d",
      "Both as a charismatic cleric in his hometown and the influential leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome, Francis was admired for his humility, simplicity and informality.",
      "In Buenos Aires, he commuted by bus, walked barefoot through the city's sprawling shantytowns and exchanged soccer banter with parishioners. At the Vatican, he shunned fancy velvet for a plain white cassock, caught people off-guard with wisecracks and expressed solidarity with the world\u2019s downtrodden.",
      "Despite his far-flung travels and frantic schedule, Francis remained attached to San Lorenzo \u2014 keeping informed of the club's ups and downs largely through the radio ever since vowing never to watch TV again in 1990.",
      "Those searching for miracles to support Francis' sainthood point to the team's meteoric rise through the ranks shortly after Francis became pope in 2013. Months later the club became Argentine champions and, in 2014, won its first Copa Libertadores \u2014 South America\u2019s equivalent of the Champions League.",
      "Twice San Lorenzo players and officials hauled trophies to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to thank Francis for his support.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s our father,\u201d said Gaciela Iglesias, 69, a decades-long club member. \u201cWe will miss him so much.\"",
      "But if Francis' papacy brought the club a streak of good luck, his death coincided with a crisis at San Lorenzo.",
      "On Monday, footage from a hidden camera leaked to the media showing the club's president, Marcelo Moretti, stuffing his pockets with several thousand dollars that he allegedly received from a player\u2019s mother in exchange for her son signing the team.",
      "Facing charges of fraud, Moretti took leave from his post on Wednesday as the Argentine Football Association opened a disciplinary investigation. While some San Lorenzo fans were saying prayers for Pope Francis, others were protesting the scandal at the club headquarters nearby.",
      "Meanwhile San Lorenzo\u2019s superstitious fans were more interested in another coincidence. Online message boards and social media groups were flooded with speculation about how Francis\u2019 club membership number \u2014 88,235 \u2014 included both his age of 88 and the exact time of his death in Buenos Aires, 2:35 a.m., or 7:35 a.m. in Rome.",

      "After the Miami Heat seized momentum and appeared on the verge of possibly tying the series, Mitchell took over. He scored Cleveland's next eight points and the Cavaliers held on for a 121-112 victory on Wednesday night for a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round series.",
      "\u201cI love the fact the game happened like this. We had to really find a way as a group and then we responded,\u201d said Mitchell, who led Cleveland with 30 points, including 17 in the fourth quarter. \u201cI kept trying to find the mismatch and make a play.\u201d",
      "It was the 27th career playoff game with at least 30 points for Mitchell, who also had six rebounds and six assists.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a superstar for a reason. It\u2019s kind of like there is nothing you can do in the NBA sometimes when someone is hitting tough shots like that,\" said Miami's Davion Mitchell, who scored 18 points.",
      "The Cavaliers had a 19-point lead with under 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter before the Heat made their run to get within 105-103 lead with 3:11 left.",
      "Mitchell responded on the ensuing trip by driving and making a step-back floater to put the Cavs up by four.",
      "After Jarett Allen made a steal on a bad pass by Miami's Nikola Jovic, Mitchell buried a 3-pointer to give momentum back to the Cavaliers, along with some breathing room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud of the guys for holding our composure. It helps when you have Donovan Mitchell. It was one of those superstar takes over games,\u201d coach Kenny Atkinson said.",
      "The top-seeded Cavaliers set an NBA playoff record with 11 3-pointers in the second quarter and had 22 for the game, tied for sixth most. Evan Mobley had 20 points and Darius Garland 19 for Cleveland.",
      "Tyler Herro scored 33 points for Miami, which hosts Game 3 on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe lost the game. I don\u2019t think there are any moral victories, to be honest. We can\u2019t have lapses where we\u2019re not fully engaged,\u201d Herro said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that cleaned up or we\u2019ll be down 3-0.\u201d",
      "Miami had a 16-7 lead before the Cavs rallied and went up 25-24 at the end of the first quarter.",

      "De'Andre Hunter's dunk with 2:33 remaining in the third quarter gave the Cavaliers a 93-74 advantage before the Heat made their charge with 10 straight points. That started a 25-8 run that saw the Heat get within a basket. Davion Mitchell scored 12 during the rally, with five points apiece by Herro and Nikola Jovic.",
      "\u201cWe knew it was going to be a full game. When they threw that punch in the fourth quarter I think everyone locked in,\u201d Mobley said.",

      "The surprise transfers of brothers Nico and Madden Iamaleava have prompted fresh questions about contracts and name, image and likeness buyouts for athletes in a college sports landscape looking increasingly like the pros",
      "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- The surprise transfers of brothers Nico and Madden Iamaleava have prompted fresh questions about contracts and name, image and likeness buyouts for athletes in a college sports landscape looking increasingly like the pros.",
      "Nico Iamaleava, who led Tennessee to the College Football Playoff last season, walked away from a reported $2.4 million NIL contract to seek higher pay elsewhere. He joined UCLA on Sunday, reportedly for half the money though terms of any NIL deal were not released.",
      "Arkansas freshman quarterback Madden Iamaleava entered the portal this week not long after spring practices wrapped up and will join his brother at UCLA, according to multiple media reports.",
      "Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek released a statement indicating he would support efforts by the Razorbacks' NIL collective to enforce buyout clauses in athlete contracts. Iamaleava reportedly had a contract valued at $500,000 upon signing with Arkansas on Dec. 4, according to reports.",
      "Arkansas Edge, the school's collective, requires athletes to repay 50% of their remaining contract value if they leave before the contract expires, according to reports. The Arkansas athletic department declined to comment and Arkansas Edge did not respond to messages.",
      "Yurachek, in a post on X that did not name Iamaleava, wrote: \u201cI have spoken with the leadership team at Arkansas Edge and expressed my support in their pursuit to enforce their rights under any agreement violated by our student-athletes moving forward. We appreciate Edge's investment in our student-athletes and acknowledge the enforcement of these agreements is vital in our new world of college athletics.\u201d",
      "The latest cycle of transfers has seen a lot of chaos and accusations of tampering. Earlier this year, Wisconsin said it had \u201ccredible information\u201d that Miami and Xavier Lucas made impermissible contact with each other before the former Badgers cornerback decided to transfer to his home-state school.",
      "All this comes with final approval of the $2.8 billion NCAA antitrust settlement looming. The plan will clear the way for Division I schools to share up to $20.5 million each with their athletes annually but also assess NIL deals athletes sign with third parties.",
      "The settlement would go into effect July 1, and athletes have been scrambling to renegotiate contracts or find better opportunities at new schools before deals valued at $600 or more must be approved through a clearinghouse that will be administered in part by financial giant Deloitte in a bid to establish fair market value.",
      "Rich Stankewicz, the director of operations for the Happy Valley United collective backing Penn State athletics, said he thinks there is a time and place for NIL buyouts, citing a spring transfer departing before playing a snap as an example. He favors incentive-based contracts contingent on in-season academic and athletic performance.",
      "\u201cIf more money is paid out in those time frames, that gives incentive for the player to stay and see those dollars from their contract, rather than potentially collecting up front and then deciding the grass is greener somewhere else three months later,\u201d he told the Associated Press.",
      "Iamaleava, who is from Long Beach, California, initially pledged to UCLA last May. He made a signing-day flip from the Bruins to Arkansas and enrolled in January. He was the No. 3 quarterback in spring practice behind Taylen Green and KJ Jackson.",
      "Some of the questions amid all the transferring and severed deals center on whether NIL deals are enforceable contracts with the NCAA settlement not yet approved.",
      "Matthew Shepherd, an attorney and member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, co-sponsored the state's NIL law. He said if Madden Iamaleava left on his own volition, the terms of the NIL deal would be subject to standard contract law.",
      "Shepherd noted the NIL law was modified in 2023 to include a provision prohibiting a third party from offering NIL inducements to an athlete who already is enrolled at one of the state's schools or who has entered into an enrollment contract. If that happened in Iamaleava's case, Shepherd said, the school or third party such as an NIL collective could take legal action against the violating party.",

      "DALLAS -- Paige Bueckers has done her best to live in the present during a short period in which she went from winning a national championship with UConn earlier this month to being the No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft and now donning a Stetson cowboy hat on a podium in Dallas City Hall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been insane. It\u2019s been nonstop on the go, I\u2019m either doing something or packing,\u201d Bueckers said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s been like for the past couple weeks. But I\u2019ve tried to stay present as much as I could, enjoy the last couple of days at UConn soaking in those relationships and those experiences, obviously enjoying the draft.\"",
      "The next step is training camp with the Dallas Wings, which starts Sunday.",
      "\u201cVery excited for the next chapter,\u201d the versatile 23-year-old guard said.",
      "Bueckers and the other four players drafted by the Wings on April 14 were introduced in a packed lobby at Dallas City Hall that included the mayor, the city council and city workers, some watching from perches on the second and third floors.",
      "\u201cWell, it was Christmas nine days ago (at the draft). Certainly, today feels like New Year\u2019s Eve or New Year\u2019s Day with the optimism and all the momentum around the Dallas Wings,\u201d new general manager Curt Miller said.",
      "There was never a question for Miller or the Wings about who their top pick would be when they won the WNBA draft lottery.",
      "\u201cThe big picture is that we knew what that meant ... exciting, exciting moment,\u201d Miller said. \u201cPaige obviously comes off a national championship, one of the most decorated collegiate players and one of the most efficient players in college basketball history.\u201d",
      "Along with proclamations from the mayor, there were also the cowboy hats for each of the Wings draftees: Bueckers, 12th overall pick Aziaha James from North Carolina State, 14th pick Madison Scott from Mississippi, 27th pick JJ Quinerly from West Virginia and 31st pick Aaronette Vonleh from Baylor.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s talked about just being a part of a new family, being a part of a new city. Dallas is a great sports city, you can feel the love and support already,\u201d Bueckers said. \"There's lot of new in this organization, so be a part of something and build with each other, and just create a new sisterhood.\u201d",
      "The introductory news conference was held a couple of blocks from the historic downtown arena being fully renovated to become the new home of the Wings next season.",
      "But Bueckers\u2019 home games in her first season with the Wings will be about 20 miles away at College Park Center at UT-Arlington, where they will play their 10th and final season since the franchise relocated from Tulsa, Oklahoma.",
      "Except for one home game on June 27. The Wings that night will play Indiana and Caitlin Clark, last year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick, at the home of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks.",
      "It was a year ago Thursday that the Dallas City Council approved a 15-year agreement worth $19 million to facilitate the team\u2019s pending move to its namesake city. The council also approved a $7.7 million renovation to the arena that was once home to the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, who moved to San Antonio to become the Spurs in 1973, and joined the NBA when the ABA folded three years later.",
      "\u201cWe stood right here in this building, and we proudly announced that the Dallas Wings would soon be making downtown Dallas their permanent home,\u201d Mayor Eric Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cAnd since then, the excitement has only grown, the fan base has rallied and today we\u2019re taking the next big step forward. Welcome, everyone, to the future of Dallas sports.\u201d",

      "Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog returned to the lineup and played his first NHL game in nearly three years Wednesday night in a 2-1 overtime loss to the Dallas Stars in Game 3",
      "DENVER -- Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog played out this moment Wednesday night in his mind again and again while working his back.",
      "His return was everything he envisioned, too. The start, anyway, with all the cheers and that big early check to show, without a doubt, that he was indeed up to speed in his first NHL game in nearly three years.",
      "It just didn't have the storybook finish.",
      "Tyler Seguin scored 5:31 into overtime and the Dallas Stars beat Colorado 2-1 in Game 3 to spoil Landeskog's return. Colorado trails 2-1 in the first-round series, with Game 4 on Saturday night in Denver.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do as a team and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cNonetheless, it felt great in all areas tonight, in terms of just being back. ... Very special night, regardless of the outcome and looking forward to Saturday already.\u201d",
      "Landeskog started alongside Nathan MacKinnon and Martin Necas. He played 13 minutes and led the team with six hits. His first one, though, made an immediate impression as he hit Stars forward Mikko Rantanen, who's his good friend and former teammate.",
      "It was an emotional lead-up to the game for Landeskog, too. There were the ovations by the crowd, and chants of \u201cLandy, Landy, Landy.\u201d There were signs all over the arena, including one held up by his kids that read, \u201cSo proud of you Daddy!\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was as close as I got to losing it during warmup, when I looked over at that and seeing their big, smiling faces,\u201d Landeskog said about his family. \"They\u2019ve probably been thinking that I\u2019ve been lying this whole time that I play hockey.",
      "\u201cThey were 1 and 2 when I last played and now they\u2019re 5 and 4. They\u2019re growing up. We\u2019ve got another one on the way coming this summer. It just puts it in perspective how much time has passed. It\u2019s very special.\u201d",
      "The team showed a video tribute of him as well, with Landeskog tapping his heart in appreciation.",
      "Landeskog made his first NHL appearance since June 26, 2022, when he and the Avalanche beat Tampa Bay to capture the Stanley Cup. He was sidelined because of a chronically injured right knee.",
      "The gap between his games with the Avalanche? Some 1,032 days.",
      "He became the fifth player in NHL history \u2014 among those with a minimum of 700 games played \u2014 to return to his team after 1,000 or more days without a contest, according to NHL Stats. The last one to do so was longtime Avalanche forward and Hall of Famer Peter Forsberg.",
      "Landeskog's presence on the ice figured to provide a big boost not only for his teammates but the capacity crowd. His No. 92 sweater is a frequent sight around the arena.",
      "The noise in the building was loud, the energy was electric \u2014 until the end.",
      "\u201cEveryone is rooting for him. It's a great comeback story,\u201d Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said Wednesday morning. \u201cI trust in Gabe\u2019s preparation, and what I\u2019m seeing with my own eyes that he\u2019s getting close and ready to play. I think he feels really good about where he\u2019s at.\u201d",
      "Landeskog\u2019s injury goes back to the 2020 \u201cbubble\u201d season when he was accidentally sliced above the knee by the skate of teammate Cale Makar in a playoff game against Dallas. Landeskog eventually underwent a cartilage transplant procedure on May 10, 2023, and has been on long-term injured reserve.",
      "He was activated Monday before Game 2 in Dallas and skated in pregame warmups, but didn't play.",
      "Stars forward Matt Duchene was teammates with Landeskog and they remain good friends.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been rooting for him to come back,\u201d said Duchene, who was the third overall pick by Colorado in 2009. \"Obviously, it makes our job harder having a guy like that out there, but on the friends side, the human side and the fellow athlete side, I think everyone\u2019s happy to see the progress he\u2019s made. ... I\u2019m just really happy that he\u2019s gotten to this point.\u201d",
      "It doesn't mean the Stars will take it easy on Landeskog.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable he\u2019s coming back, if he\u2019s coming back, as a friend,\u201d said Rantanen, a 2015 first-round pick by Colorado before being traded in January to Carolina and on to Dallas in March. \u201cAs an opponent, obviously, no mercy.\u201d",
      "The feeling is mutual.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what jersey he wears, I love him. He\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d Landeskog said of Rantanen. \u201cBut in this series, we\u2019re not friends when we\u2019re playing.\u201d",
      "The 32-year-old Landeskog recently went through a two-game conditioning stint with the American Hockey League\u2019s Colorado Eagles. He's practiced with the Avalanche leading up to their opener in the NHL playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have him back in the room and back with us,\u201d Makar said. \u201cThought he played really well so hopefully he continues that way. He\u2019s definitely big to have back in the room.\u201d",

      "Rory McIlroy says he wasn't going to let a cold or post-Masters fatigue stop him from joining friend Shane Lowry to defend their title at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans",
      "AVONDALE, La. -- Rory McIlroy \u2014 his voice raspy from a cold that made it tough for him to get out of bed a couple of days earlier \u2014 expressed relief that he'd have a teammate to lean on in his first PGA Tour event since his historic triumph at the Masters two weekends ago.",
      "\u201cJust to be here and feeling better is an achievement,\u201d McIlroy said Wednesday while seated next to Shane Lowry, his teammate in this week's Zurich Classic of New Orleans, where the pair are defending champions. \u201cBut I need to put a little bit of practice and a bit of work in today to make sure I don\u2019t let this man down.\u201d",
      "The way McIlroy's humility and authenticity complement his extraordinary talent has made him arguably the most popular and charismatic golfer in the world.",
      "That hasn't changed since he became just the sixth man to win all four majors tournaments by edging Justin Rose in a playoff at Augusta National on April 13.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing few days, to be able to reflect on it and everything that happened and the magnitude of everything,\" McIlroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you get to fulfill one of your lifelong goals and dreams, and I\u2019ve just tried to enjoy everything that comes along with that.",
      "\u201cI obviously could not be in a better place in my life \u2014 professionally, personally, all of it,\u201d McIlroy added.",
      "Golf wasn't a top priority for McIlroy in the nine days between winning his first green jacket and playing his practice round at the TPC Louisiana on Wednesday.",
      "The Northern Ireland native went to London with wife Erica and daughter Poppy to check on a home they're building there, then hopped over the Irish Sea to Belfast to be with family and lifelong friends.",
      "He received countless messages of congratulations from fans, other elite athletes and \u201cpeople that you would never even think would watch golf or would know what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "He said two presidents reached out, as did some in the entertainment industry. Many communicated that they found his path inspiring not just because of the composure he summoned after losing the lead in the final round of this year's Masters, but also in light of some of his dramatic final-round disappointments \u2014 or collapses \u2014 in years past. His 2011 Masters, when he shot a final-round 80 and lost a four-shot lead, comes to mind.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me is just how the whole journey resonated with people,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cPeople can see themselves in the struggle at times and everything that you sort of try to put into getting the best out of yourself in that journey.\u201d",
      "McIlroy has been playing some of the best golf of his career in the past year \u2014 and pointed to his decision to pair up with Lowry, an Irishman and old friend, at the 2024 Zurich Classic as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for that.",
      "\u201cThis tournament last year was a really cool moment for both of us and I think it probably injected a little bit of joy back into golf for me in some way, which I think is really, really important not to lose that,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "That is why \u2014 despite his post-Masters fatigue and the cold he caught \u2014 he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d committed to coming back.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun event to be out there with Shane and I also know that it\u2019s not all on me,\" McIlroy said. \"He has to do some of the work, too, maybe a lot of it the next few days. It\u2019s a perfect tournament to come back to with good positive vibes from last year.\u201d",
      "Lowry recalled being on the 15th hole during his final round at Augusta National, out of the running for a win and watching the leaderboard to see if McIlroy would finally get his green jacket. It was then that he wondered aloud to his caddie if McIlroy might skip New Orleans.",
      "\u201cI was very excited that Rory still decided to come here because I just want to see what it\u2019s going to be like this week,\u201d Lowry said. \"I\u2019m sure the crowds are going to be huge.",
      "\u201cI know he\u2019s not done much practicing in the last two weeks. I know I\u2019m going to have to step up, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Lowry continued.",
      "Lowry said he's comfortable with his role on McIlroy's team \u2014 even now that his teammate has reached a new level of historical significance in golf and stardom in general.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Rory for years and we\u2019re good friends,\u201d Lowry said. \"So, if I was sitting beside another guy that just completed the Grand Slam and I was his partner this week, it might feel a little bit different. But I know him so well. Nothing phases me being around him.\u201d",

      "Barring a last-minute trade, every team will go into the draft with its original first-round pick for the first time in the common draft era that began in 1967.",
      "That's in stark contrast to recent years when teams were much more willing to trade away or swap first-round picks, with an average of more than seven teams entering the last five drafts without their original first-round picks. That peaked in 2022 when 11 teams entered draft day without their own first-round pick thanks in part to previous deals for players like Deshaun Watson, Russell Wilson, Trey Lance, Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams.",
      "The closest the league has come in the common draft era with every team holding its own first-round pick, according to research by ESPN, came in 1993 when Kansas City dealt its first-rounder to San Francisco for Joe Montana five days before the draft.",
      "The static picks are unlikely to hold through the first round on Thursday night as teams are likely to make moves up or down the board depending on which players are available. Just last year there were five draft-day trades involving first-round picks that saw picks change hands eight times.",
      "It looks like a quarterback once again will be taken first in the draft, with the odds that Cam Ward goes No. 1 to Tennessee exceeding 99%, according to the latest odds from BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "That would mark the seventh time in eight years that a QB went first, with Jacksonville's pick of Travon Walker in 2022 as the only exception. That's been part of a long trend as the NFL has prioritized passing. Quarterbacks have been taken first overall in 20 of the previous 27 drafts.",
      "But that wasn't always the case.",
      "Drew Bledsoe (1993 to New England) was the only quarterback from 1991-97 to be taken first, and there was an 11-year stretch from 1972-82 that had only one QB taken with the No. 1 pick: Steve Bartkowski to Atlanta in 1975.",
      "Almost every team has taken a shot on a first-round quarterback in recent years, but the team with the longest drought could snap it on Thursday.",
      "New Orleans hasn't drafted a quarterback with its first-round pick in the common draft since taking Archie Manning in 1971, but it could snap that streak this year given the uncertainty surrounding the status of Derek Carr.",
      "The only other teams that haven't drafted a QB in the first round in the past 15 drafts are the the Cowboys (1989), Seahawks (1993), Raiders (2007) and Lions (2009).",
      "The Tennessee Titans are set to pick first in the draft for the first time since the franchise took Earl Campbell in 1978 when the team was known as the Houston Oilers.",
      "The Titans traded away the top pick in 2016 to the Rams but now have a chance, marking the seventh time that the top pick has gone to an AFC South team since the start of the eight-division era in 2002.",
      "The AFC South will be the first division in that span with every team making the No. 1 pick, with Houston having done it three times since 2002, Jacksonville twice and Indianapolis once.",
      "Next up on the list is the AFC North, where Cleveland and Cincinnati have both had the top pick twice, and the NFC West, with the Rams having the top pick twice and Arizona and San Francisco once each since 2002.",
      "The AFC West and NFC South have each made the top pick three times in that span, with the NFC North doing it twice and AFC East doing it once.",
      "The only division that hasn't made the top pick since 2002 is the NFC East, although that comes with a bit of a caveat. In 2004, the Chargers drafted Eli Manning first overall but traded him during the draft to the New York Giants. The last time a team in the NFC East made the No. 1 pick was in 1991, when Dallas drafted Russell Maryland.",

      "Legge, who has started four Indy 500s but is a relative novice in stock cars, added during Tuesday's episode of her \u201cThrottle Therapy\u201d podcast that \u201cthe inappropriate social media comments I've received aren't just disturbing, they are unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d the British driver said, \u201cI'm here to race and I'm here to compete, and I won't tolerate any of these threats to my safety or to my dignity, whether that's on track or off of it.\u201d",
      "Legge became the first woman in seven years to start a Cup Series race earlier this year at Phoenix. But her debut in NASCAR's top series ended when Legge, who had already spun once, was involved in another spin and collected Daniel Suarez.",
      "Her next start was the lower-level Xfinity race in Rockingham, North Carolina, last Saturday. Legge was good enough to make the field on speed but was bumped off the starting grid because of ownership points. Ultimately, she was able to take J.J. Yeley's seat in the No. 53 car for Joey Gase Motorsports, which had to scramble at the last minute to prepare the car for her.",
      "Legge was well off the pace as the leaders were lapping her, and when she entered Turn 1, William Sawalich got into the back of her car. That sent Legge spinning, and Kahne had nowhere to go, running into her along the bottom of the track.",
      "\u201cI gave (Sawalich) a lane and the reason the closing pace looks so high isn\u2019t because I braked mid-corner. I didn\u2019t. I stayed on my line, stayed doing my speed, which obviously isn\u2019t the speed of the leaders because they\u2019re passing me,\u201d Legge said. \u201cHe charged in a bit too hard, which is the speed difference you see. He understeered up a lane and into me, which spun me around.\u201d",
      "The 44-year-old Legge has experience in a variety of cars across numerous series. She made seven IndyCar starts for Dale Coyne Racing last year, and she has raced for several teams over more than a decade in the IMSA SportsCar series.",
      "She has dabbled in NASCAR in the past, too, starting four Xfinity races during the 2018 season and another two years ago.",
      "\u201cI have earned my seat on that race track,\" Legge said. \"I\u2019ve worked just as hard as any of the other drivers out there, and I\u2019ve been racing professionally for the last 20 years. I\u2019m 100 percent sure that the ... the teams that employed me \u2014 without me bringing any sponsorship money for the majority of those 20 years \u2014 did not do so as a DEI hire, or a gimmick, or anything else. It\u2019s because I can drive a race car.\u201d",
      "Legge believes the vitriol she has received on social media is indicative of a larger issue with women in motorsports.",
      "\u201cLuckily,\u201d she said, \u201cI have been in tougher battles than you guys in the comment sections.\u201d",
      "Legge has received plenty of support from those in the racing community. IndyCar driver Marco Andretti clapped back at one critic on social media who called Legge \u201cunproven\u201d in response to a post about her history at the Indy 500.",
      "\u201cIt's wild to me how many grown men talk badly about badass girls like this,\u201d Andretti wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cDoes it make them feel more manly from the couch or something?\u201d",

      "The league said the eight games over the weekend averaged 4.4 million viewers, the highest average in 25 years and a 17% increase over the opening weekend of last season\u2019s playoffs.",
      "ESPN added that it was the most-watched opening weekend ever on its platforms, with nearly 6.7 million people on average watching Sunday\u2019s Boston-Orlando game on ABC and a peak of just over 8 million for that game.",
      "Silver said what really excites him moving to a digital world is the ability to reach fans in a variety of ways.",
      "\u201cI say think of the Manning House but on steroids,\u201d Silver said. \"Essentially unlimited numbers of alternative channels.\u201d",
      "The NBA acknowledged that ratings got off to a slow start this season, which it attributed in part to a World Series going on between two huge media markets \u2014 New York and Los Angeles \u2014 and additional attention being placed on the presidential election.",
      "The numbers ticked upward throughout the season and Silver recently said the league was down only about 2% year-over-year going into the final weeks of the regular season.",

      "Many NFL fans spend the weeks leading up the draft poring over mock drafts to try to figure out which players their favorites teams are most likely to select.",
      "Those projections quickly become obsolete once the actual draft begins with some predicted targets inevitably coming off the board before a team even makes its pick.",
      "That was the motivation for the NFL's NextGen Stats team to create a new draft site that takes elements from the old draft preview magazines with the easily digestible information with the ability to adapt seamlessly with each move made before or during the draft.",
      "\u201cThe draft magazine was so efficient at displaying information in a easy to digest way,\u201d said Mike Band, the senior manager for research and analytics at NFL NextGen Stats. \u201cIn a lot of ways as we\u2019ve optimized for mobile experiences, we\u2019ve lost that art of a dashboard-like experience. That was the impetus for this project, creating a digital magazine that could be updated live and evolve in a dynamic way and hopefully have really fun and engaging live features.\u201d",
      "The NFL Draft IQ site launched earlier this month to preview the draft was designed to be the ideal second screen during the draft starting Thursday night. The site includes team-by-team pages that list each team's picks in the next two drafts, moves they had made in the offseason, potential draft targets for each day of the draft, a mock draft tracker and historic tendencies for each general manager.",
      "The site was created in less than three weeks from idea to the execution with help from Amazon QuickSight, building on the work the NextGen Stats team did in creating Combine IQ, which provided context and comparisons to the loads of data produced at the annual scouting combine.",
      "Band has been posting potential first-round targets for teams for the past six years and has had a high rate with about three-quarters of the teams taking one of his potential targets.",
      "That work used from looking at team needs, draft history, mock drafts, pre-draft meetings and other information leads to the potential targets on the Draft IQ site for each team for each day. Those will be updated throughout the draft based on who's left on the board and what needs have been met.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun exercise to try to match these teams to players across different pre-draft interests, team needs,\u201d Band said. \u201cA lot of teams have a lot of smoke screens, so you almost have to read between the lines in a lot ways.\u201d",
      "The team pages include tendencies for general managers, including how often they have traded up or down, whether they target certain positions in the prime rounds and if the GM has had patterns based on size, age or other attributes when picking players.",
      "For example, Houston\u2019s Nick Caserio has used 31 of his 32 picks on players who came out of power conferences. The Bengals also tend to go that direction with all 22 of their picks in the first two rounds since 2014 coming from power conference schools.",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s Howie Roseman has used 10 of his 13 first-round picks when running the draft on the trenches, while Detroit\u2019s Brad Holmes\u2019 picks have the highest average athleticism score from NGS since he took over in 2021.",
      "\u201cIf you want to know who the last few picks were you can go to the draft tracker on NFL(dot)com,\u201d Band said. \u201cBut if you want to go deeper into every pick as it\u2019s happening and trying to anticipate the next pick and you want to sound smart at an NFL draft party and tip the pick without actually talking to Ian Rapoport, then follow along with Draft IQ.\u201d",

      "These generally are not state-run giants like SAIC, BAIC and Guangzhou Automotive. The founder of Geely started out making refrigerators.",
      "BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world\u2019s largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
      "Here are some of the key players:",
      "Great Wall Motors, with the Haval, Wey, Ora, Poer and Tank brands, is banking on overseas sales to keep growing after seeing its sales inside China fall by nearly 15% last year, even as the company\u2019s net profit jumped more than 80%. The company has factories in Russia, Thailand and Brazil, where it is challenging Toyota\u2019s popular Hilux pickup truck with its GWM Poer, a hybrid pickup of its own. Another mainstay is the Haval H6, a hybrid sports SUV.",
      "Great Wall has smoothed its transition to overseas production by buying factories of other automakers. In Thailand, it took over a factory formerly operated by General Motors Corp. In Brazil, it purchased a former Mercedes-Benz plant.",
      "\u201cIt is essential for volume to be big, otherwise the cost of production is too high,\u201d Great Wall\u2019s chairman, Wei Jianjun, said in a media huddle at the show. Wei, who also goes by the name Jack Wey, was born in Beijing but moved to nearby Hebei, home of the Great Wall. He led the company\u2019s transition from vehicle modification to automaking, becoming China\u2019s biggest maker of pickup trucks and a leading SUV maker. The company has a joint venture for EVs with BMW.",
      "State-owned Chery Automobile says it was the first Chinese automaker to export overseas. It has sold more than 15 million of its Chery, Exeed, Omoda and Jetour models overseas, mostly in the developing world and emerging markets, including Turkey and Ukraine. Chery reported selling 2.6 million vehicles overseas last year and is aiming for 3 million in 2025. It\u2019s quickly expanding overseas production, setting up factories in Russia and Spain. It is expanding rapidly in Latin America.",
      "Chery\u2019s tie-up with EV-maker Visionary Vehicles aimed to sell in North America but has not yet achieved that goal. The company has a 50-50 joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India that makes Jaguars and Land Rovers in China. It also collaborates with Huawei Technologies and e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "Chery still sells far more fuel-engine cars than EVs. Its battery electric vehicle company, Chery New Energy, makes minivehicles like the eQ1, or Small Ant, and the QQ Ice Cream. Its mainstays are the Tiggo lineup of SUVs and its Arrizo sedans.",
      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",

      "BYD barely nudged ahead of Tesla in production of battery-powered EVs in 2024, making 1,777,965 compared with Tesla\u2019s 1,773,443.",
      "Geely Auto is perhaps the most famous Chinese automaker that many people have never heard of. The privately held company was founded as a refrigerator-maker by businessman Li Shufu in 1997 in eastern China\u2019s Taizhou, which early on became a hub of private industry.",
      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus. It formed a 50-50 joint venture to make Smart city cars with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. It also works with Renault SA of France on powertrains and owns a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda.",

It sold more than 673,000 EVs in China and has a market share of only 6% compared with BYD\u2019s nearly one-third share. Tesla came in third at 659,000 cars sold.",
      "Apart from its Baojun sedans and vans, Wuling mainly makes engines, commercial vehicles and special purpose vehicles like mini-EVs and golf carts.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them, part of his escalating campaign to end what he calls \" wokeness \u201d and diversity efforts in education.",
      "In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The State Bar of California has disclosed that some multiple-choice questions in a problem-plagued bar exam were developed with the aid of artificial intelligence.",
      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,\u201d Leah Wilson, the State Bar\u2019s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement.",
      "Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering admission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "Former employees of OpenAI are asking the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to stop the company from shifting control of its artificial intelligence technology from a nonprofit charity to a for-profit business.",
      "They\u2019re concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harms.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",
      "\u201cIf OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI\u2019s duty to the public can vanish overnight,\u201d Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Another former worker who signed the letter puts it more bluntly.",
      "\u201cOpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed,\" said Nisan Stiennon, an AI engineer who worked at OpenAI from 2018 to 2020. \"It is to OpenAI\u2019s credit that it\u2019s controlled by a nonprofit with a duty to humanity. This duty precludes giving up that control.\u201d",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "Google will confront an existential threat Monday as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into a ruthless monopoly.",
      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "Warren asks for details on how students and families will be affected by any cuts to funding or services if the Education Department is abolished or its functions are transferred to other federal agencies. The groups have until May 22 to respond.",
      "The Massachusetts Democrat and former public school teacher outlines what she calls the Education Department's key functions in each letter, including protecting the civil rights of students, providing funding for students with disabilities, funding research that helps educators and students, and distributing federal financial aid for students to attain higher education.",
      "\"School districts are already preparing for potential funding delays or cuts caused by the dismantling of the Department, with states sounding the alarm about the impact of these funding disruptions on programs like free school lunches for low-income students,\" Warren wrote.",
      "But Education Secretary Linda McMahon previously told ABC News \"none of the funding will stop\" for mandatory programs, arguing that more funding could go to the states if the department is eliminated. It would also take 60 \"yes\" votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster and completely dismantle the agency Congress created.",
      "National Parents Union President Keri Rodrigues decried the president and McMahon's mission to shutter the agency, calling it a \"constitutional crisis on almost every front.\"",
      "NAACP President Derrick Johnson said the administration is \"deliberately dismantling the basic functions of our democracy, one piece at a time.\"",
      "Warren's comprehensive investigation also comes on the heels of roughly 2,000 employees at the education department officially being separated from the agency. The Education Department was slashed nearly in half, including hundreds of Federal Student Aid (FSA) employees whose jobs Warren stressed are critically important to students in need. In addition, Warren said downsizing the agency will have \"dire consequences\" for the country's more than 40 million student loan borrowers.",
      "Launched in April, her Save Our Schools campaign vowed to fight back against the administration's executive order entitled improving education outcomes by empowering parents, states and communities.",
      "Through a combination of federal investigations, oversight, storytelling, and lawsuits, Warren said she will work with the community, including lawmakers in Congress, to do everything she possibly can to defend public education.",
      "\"The federal government has invested in our public schools,\" Warren said in an exclusive interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Taking that away from our kids so that a handful of billionaires can be even richer is just plain ugly and I will fight it with everything I've got.\"",

While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China remained the exception. Instead, Beijing raised its own tariffs and deployed other economic measures in response while vowing to \u201cfight to the end.\u201d For example, China restricted exports of rare earth minerals and raised multiple cases against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.",
      "China also made it clear that talks should involve the cancellation of all tariffs it currently faces.",
      "\u201cThe unilateral tariff increase measures were initiated by the United States. If the United States really wants to solve the problem, it should face up to the rational voices of the international community and all parties at home, completely cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, and find ways to resolve differences through equal dialogue,\u201d said He, the spokesman.",
      "Despite the economic measures leveled against China, Trump said Tuesday that he would be \u201cvery nice\u201d and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,\u201d Trump said.",

      "After severe storms hit the state in mid-March, Sanders applied for disaster relief through FEMA, under what's known as a major disaster declaration. The request was denied.",
      "\"As Governor Sanders noted in her request, these storms caused catastrophic damage across the state, resulting in disastrous amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the deaths of three Arkansans, and injuries to many more,\" the state's two Republican senators and four GOP House members wrote in an April 21 letter to Trump. \"Given the cumulative impact and sheer magnitude of destruction from these severe weather events, federal assistance is vital to ensure that state and local communities have the capabilities needed to rebuild.\"",
      "This isn't the first time FEMA has denied state requests recently. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, of Washington, said FEMA had denied his state's application for federal disaster relief stemming from a \"bomb cyclone\" that slammed the state last November.",
      "\u201cThis is another troubling example of the federal government withholding funding,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement. \"Washington communities have been waiting for months for the resources they need to fully recover from last winter\u2019s devastating storms, and this decision will cause further delay.

      "From Blue Origin and Palantir to Nasdaq and the NFL, hundreds of major companies have been flocking to the firms of lobbyists Brian Ballard and Jeff Miller as the two companies bolster their standing as the Trump administration's power brokers.",
      "Ballard Partners, the firm of Florida-based fundraiser and longtime Trump ally Brian Ballard, made $14.3 million in federal lobbying income just in the first three months of this year, according to lobbying disclosures. At that rate, the company is on track to potentially triple or even quadruple the roughly $19 million it made from federal lobbying in all of 2024.",
      "Ballard Partners, which had already made its name as an ally of Trump during his first Trump presidency, has signed more than 100 new federal lobbying clients since November, according to filings.",
      "During the presidency of Joe Biden, the lobbying business of Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of then-White House Counselor Steven Ricchetti, thrived in a similar manner, picking up major clients like Amazon and TC Energy and more than doubling its lobbying income in 2021 compared to the year before.",
      "But Ballard Partners and Jeff Miller's firm, Miller Strategies, have expanded even faster, with new Ballard clients including Netflix, American Express and JP Morgan, on top of the NFL and Blue Origin.",
      "The data analytics company Palantir hired both Ballard and Miller's firms earlier this year as Palantir CEO Alex Karp -- once a vocal Trump critic and a Democrat -- has been boosting Trump with a hefty political donation and supportive public comments on Elon Musk and his government-slashing efforts. Karp's company has also reportedly received an increased number of federal contracts under Trump's presidency.",
      "Also among Ballard's new clients are blockchain company Ripple Labs, which hired Ballard just days after Trump's November victory and later gave nearly $5 million in contributions to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee; crypto exchange platform Kraken's parent company Payward, which also gave $1 million to the inaugural committee; and crypto exchange company Blockchain.com.",
      "Ballard was also hired by TikTok last September as that company sought to maintain its U.S. footprint amid calls to ban the service. Ballard has also lobbied for the Chinese clothing retail company Shein since May of last year.",
      "Separately, Ballard's firm also represents the Embassy of the Republic of Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to foreign lobbying disclosures.",
      "Headed by Jeff Miller, who served as a finance chair on Trump's second inaugural committee and was previously former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's fundraiser, Miller Strategies took in nearly $9 million in just the first three months of this year, which was on track to dwarf the roughly $12 million his firm brought in from federal lobbying during all of 2024.",
      "Miller has signed at least 55 new clients since Trump's reelection according to filings, including OpenAI and Nasdaq, as well as Softbank Group, the Japanese company that announced a $100 million investment in the U.S. during a press conference with Trump in December.",
      "Other lobbyists that recently raised money for Trump and are now enjoying success include Akin Gump's Geoff Verhoff, who brought in $3.4 million during 2025's first three months, and Brownstein Hyatt's Marc Lampkin, who took in $3 million.",
      "Verhoff's single biggest client is Nippon Steel, which so far this year has paid Akin Gump nearly $1.7 million amid the ongoing merger negotiations between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel.",
      "Lampkin's biggest client is Tencent America LLC, an American arm of the Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent, which owns the major Chinese messaging apps WeChat and QQ.",

      "In one on-camera moment, attendees appear to be arguing with each another. It's not clear, but the argument appears to be about tattoos. Abrego Garcia was identified as a member of the MS-13 gang by one of his tattoos, although he and his family deny any affiliation with the gang.",
      "Another constituent can be heard shouting, \"Shut up! Shut up!\"",
      "Grassley said the language he heard at Wednesday's town hall was \"stronger\" than what he's seen elsewhere.",
      "\"You'll see that people have very strong feelings. You heard me also say in the beginning that a lot of us have been advised not to have these town meetings because it gives a forum for people to exert disagreement,\" Grassley says. \"Sometimes very strong disagreement with what's going on in Washington.\"",
      "Republican leaders have suggested that members avoid in-person town halls after several incidents with angry audience members earlier this year.",
      "\"The bottom line of it is that the language you heard here, and I heard, was stronger than it's been in any place I have and I don't think it's typical of Worth County. It's not typical of most town meetings I have, and let's just say this is an outlier,\u201d Grassley says.",

      "Longtime Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection in 2026 and will retire after serving for over four decades in Congress.",
      "\"In my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch,\" Durbin said in the video. \"The threats to our democracy and way of life are real, and I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.\"",
      "Durbin, 80, has served in the Senate since 1997 and won reelection to the Senate four times. Coupled with his time in the House, Durbin has served in Congress for 44 years.",
      "\"We are also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,\" Durbin said in the video. \"We need them now more than ever.\"",
      "His departure will set up a contentious race among Illinois Democrats vying to fill the seat in a solidly blue state.",
      "\"It has been an honor serving alongside Sen. Dick Durbin in Congress. I have long admired his focus on creating jobs in Illinois, bringing down costs for working families and protecting benefits for veterans and seniors,\" Rep. Eric Sorensen, D-Ill., said following Durbin's announcement. \"As a dedicated public servant for more than four decades, Sen. Durbin has been a strong voice for Illinoisans, ushering into law many historic bills as a long-time leader in the U.S. Senate. I am grateful for the legacy he leaves behind that has helped improve millions of our Illinois neighbors.\"",
      "It will also leave a void in Democratic leadership in the Senate. Durbin, as Democratic whip, has served as the Senate's No. 2 Democrat since 2004. Now, Democrats will need to reshuffle to fill Durbin's position.",
      "There are a number of younger Senate Democrats who have been working to make names for themselves this Congress, and its not clear who might jump into that leadership race. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is currently the No. 3 Senate Democrat, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is the No. 4 Senate Democrat. Either of them could enter the contest.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Durbin in a statement following the announcement.",
      "\"Dick Durbin has been more than a colleague -- he's been a trusted partner, one of the most respected voices in the Senate for decades, my dear friend, and, of course, my former roommate,\" Schumer said. \"His deep commitment to justice, his tireless advocacy for Americans in need, and his wisdom in leadership have left an indelible mark on this institution, the United States, and his beloved Illinois. The Senate -- and the country -- are better because of his service. To my friend, Dick: Thank you, for everything.\"",
      "Durbin has served as the top Democrat, in his capacity as either chairman or ranking member, of the Senate Judiciary Committee since 2021. He helped to confirm 235 federal judges under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Durbin is now the fourth Democrat to announce plans not to run in 2026. Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Tina Smith, D-Minn., are also retiring. Sen. Michael Bennet is running for Colorado governor despite his term not ending until 2028, and if he wins, he will vacate a fifth Democratic seat.",

      "The judge had asked government officials to answer questions under oath.",
      "A federal judge is temporarily pausing discovery in the case of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Wednesday evening pausing expedited discovery in the case for seven days. The move came after the Trump administration, in a sealed motion earlier in the day, asked the judge for the pause.",
      "The judge's order said the pause was made with the agreement of both the government and attorneys representing Abrego Garcia.",
      "On Tuesday, Xinis had ordered the government to more fully answer questions about the wrongful deportation and to respond by Wednesday evening to discovery requests from Abrego Garcia's attorneys.",
      "Last week, Xinis slammed Justice Department attorneys over their inaction in the case and ordered government officials to testify under oath through expedited discovery.",
      "\"Given that this Court expressly warned Defendants and their counsel to adhere strictly to their discovery obligations ... their boilerplate, non-particularized objections are presumptively invalid and reflect a willful refusal to comply with this Court's Discovery Order and governing rules,\" Xinis wrote Tuesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who has been living with his wife and children in Maryland, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration, while acknowledging that Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in error, has said that his alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return to the United States. His wife and attorney have denied that he is an MS-13 member.",
      "Judge Xinis early this month ruled that the Trump administration must \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return, and the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that ruling, \"with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\"",
      "Earlier Tuesday, government attorneys asserted that providing detailed information on the legal basis for Abrego Garcia's confinement would be \"wholly inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions,\" according to a joint letter outlining the discovery disputes between the parties.",
      "\"Upon Abrego's repatriation to El Salvador, his detention was no longer a matter of the United States' confinement, but a matter belonging to the government of El Salvador -- which has been explained to the Plaintiffs repeatedly,\" the government said.",
      "Attorneys for Abrego Garcia in the letter accused the Trump administration of responding to their discovery requests by producing \"nothing of substance\" and providing interrogatory responses that are \"non-responsive.\"",

      "The rally will take place one day before Trump\u2019s 100th day in office \u2014 a traditional early milestone in which a president's progress is measured against campaign promises. Michigan was one of the key battleground states Trump flipped last year from Democrats on his path back to the White House.",
      "Trump has not traveled much since taking office outside of personal weekend trips. His only other official trip in his second term was during the first week, when he visited disaster zones in North Carolina and California and held an event in Las Vegas to promote his plan to eliminate taxes on tips.",
      "But later this week, Trump will travel to Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, the first foreign trip in his second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s upcoming trip to Michigan follows a series of meetings and phone calls with the state\u2019s high-profile Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. Once a sharp critic of Trump, Whitmer has said that she hopes to find common ground with the president in his second term.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure to combat the overtourism that officials say is putting the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage visits.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The tax charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans will pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and near St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "The amount in euros that the city of Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials say 8,000 day-trippers paid in advance to enter the city on Friday, among the 77,000 who have already registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- State lawmakers across the U.S. have introduced at least 240 anti-China proposals this year, aiming to ensure public funds don't buy Chinese technology or even T-shirts, coffee mugs and key chains for tourists. They're also targeting sister-city relationships between American and Chinese communities.",
      "After years celebrating trade ties with China, states don't want police to buy Chinese drones, government agencies to use Chinese apps, software or parts, or public pension systems to invest in Chinese companies. A new Kansas law covers artificial intelligence and medical equipment, while in Arkansas, the targets include sister-city ties and state and local contracts for promotional items. Tennessee now prohibits health insurance coverage for organ transplants performed in China or with organs from China.",
      "\u201cEither the United States or China is going to lead the world in the next few decades,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said after successfully pushing a wide-ranging \u201cCommunist China Defense\u201d package into law. \u201cFor me, I want it to be the U.S.\u201d",
      "The push started well before President Donald Trump imposed 145% tariffs on China, but his posture is encouraging state officials, particularly fellow Republicans. Sanders said her efforts compliment Trump's trade policies.",
      "Anti-China proposals have been introduced this year in at least 41 states, but mostly in GOP-controlled legislatures, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Trump's rhetoric encouraged the push since his first term, said Kyle Jaros, an associate professor of global affairs at the University of Notre Dame who writes about China\u2019s relationships with U.S. states. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic soured American attitudes.",
      "\u201cThe first Trump administration had a very different message than the preceding Obama administration about state and local engagement with China,\u201d Jaros said. \u201cIt tended to not see the value.\u201d",
      "Playing a \"patriotism card\u201d against China resonates with U.S. voters, said David Adkins, a former Kansas legislator who is CEO of the nonpartisan Council on State Governments.",
      "\u201cPoliticians of both parties, at all levels of government, pay no price for vilifying China,\u201d Adkins said in an email.",
      "John David Minnich, a scholar of modern China and assistant professor at the London School of Economics, attributed states\u2019 measures largely to \u201ctargeted, strategic lobbying,\u201d not a popular pressure.",
      "Critics see China as more anti-American and authoritarian under President Xi Jinping, and U.S. officials say China has a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem to collect overseas intelligence.",
      "Some state officials also began seeing China as a concrete threat when a Chinese balloon flew over the U.S. in 2023, said Sara Newland, an associate professor of government at Smith College who conducts research with Jaros.",
      "\u201cThere is this idea that a Chinese investment is actually going to result in the Chinese government spying on individual people or threatening food security in a particular area,\u201d she said.",
      "Kansas House Majority Leader Chris Croft, a retired Army colonel, said countering China is a \u201cjoint effort\u201d for states and the U.S. government. He championed a new law greatly limiting property ownership within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of a military installation in Kansas by firms and people tied to foreign adversaries \u2014 China, but also Cuba, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\u201cAll of us have a part to play,\u201d Croft said.",
      "Further limiting foreign property ownership remains popular, with at least 46 proposals in 24 states, but critics liken imposing restrictions to selling snow shovels to Miami residents.",
      "Together, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean and Cuban interests owned less than 1% of the nation\u2019s 1.27 billion acres of agricultural land at the end of 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report. Chinese interests\u2019 share was about 277,000 acres, or two-hundredths of 1%.",
      "And in Arkansas, only the state capital of Little Rock is affected by the ban on sister-city relationships.",
      "Misgivings about anti-China measures extend even to conservative North Dakota, where a Chinese company's plan to develop farmland near an Air Force base inspired anti-China efforts that spread elsewhere.",
      "Some North Dakota lawmakers wanted to divest a state fund holding billions of dollars in oil tax revenues from Chinese companies. But the Senate killed a weaker version of the measure last week.",
      "Republican Sen. Dale Patten suggested during the debate that lawmakers backing the bill were being inconsistent.",
      "\u201cI would guess that this body right now is already heavily invested in neckties that have been manufactured in China, if we want to flip our ties over and take a look at it,\u201d Patten said. \u201cThat\u2019s how difficult it is when we talk about doing something like this.\u201d",
      "Minnich said if Trump's tariffs get China to reset relations with the U.S., that would undercut what states have done. If Trump seeks \u201csustained decoupling,\u201d state measures likely will have minimal effect on China in the short-term, compared to Trump's policies, he said.",
      "Yet states don't seem likely to stop.",

Then he cut her throat. His girlfriend, who was Brown\u2019s cousin, was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone doing that to someone, even their worst enemy. I don\u2019t know what kind of mind has that kind of thinking,\u201d Jackie Wileman, Brown\u2019s stepmother, told the judge at Osgood\u2019s 2014 sentencing hearing.",
      "In handing down the death sentence, the judge noted that Osgood had a difficult childhood that included sexual abuse, abandonment and a suicide attempt. But the judge also said that it was Osgood who cut Brown\u2019s neck and stabbed her as she begged the couple not to hurt her.",
      "Osgood said last week that he regrets all the \u201cpain and suffering\u201d he has caused Brown's family, and his own.",
      "\u201cI would like to say to the victim\u2019s family, I apologize,\" Osgood said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask their forgiveness because I know they can\u2019t give it.\" Only God can grant forgiveness, he said.",
      "Osgood's initial death sentence was thrown out by an appeals court ruling that jurors were given improper instructions. At his resentencing in 2018, Osgood asked to be executed, saying he didn't want the families to endure another hearing.",
      "The Death Penalty Information Center reported last year that 165 of the peo\u00adple executed since a moratorium on the death penalty ended in 1977 \u2014 a total that has since grown to more than 1650 people \u2014 asked to be put to death. The center also said that the overwhelming majority of these volunteers had histories of men\u00adtal ill\u00adness, sub\u00adstance abuse or suicidal ideation.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey made a rare move this year to grant clemency to another death row inmate, commuting the death sentence of Robin \u201cRocky\u201d Myers to life in prison. The governor said there were enough questions about his guilt that she could not move forward with his execution. It was the only time Ivey has granted clemency, and the first time any Alabama governor commuted a death sentence since 1999.",

      "An Illinois man who admitted to a mass shooting at a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade in 2022 is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday",
      "WAUKEGAN, Ill. -- The man who admitted to a 2022 mass shooting at a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade was set to be sentenced Thursday, a day after survivors and witnesses gave emotional testimony about how their lives have changed since he killed seven people and hurt dozens more.",
      "Robert E. Crimo III, 24, changed his plea to guilty last month, mere moments before the start of his trial. His case has progressed slowly, in part because of his erratic behavior. That history continued Wednesday when he refused to attend court despite a judge's previous warnings that the case would proceed without him.",
      "Keely Roberts, whose 8-year-old son Cooper Roberts was the youngest person wounded and is paralyzed from the waist down, called Crimo \u201ccowardly\u201d for not attending.",
      "\u201cYou will not hear my grief,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are now irrelevant.\u201d",
      "Some survivors called Crimo a \u201cmonster\u201d while another cited their faith in forgiving him. Many described feeling empty or facing deep sadness since the shooting. Some no longer attend public gatherings.",
      "Crimo is certain to spend the rest of his life behind bars. He pleaded guilty to 21 counts of first-degree murder \u2014 three counts for each person killed \u2014 and 48 counts of attempted murder. Each first-degree murder count carries a maximum life sentence in Illinois.",
      "But even in his absence, prosecutors made sure Crimo's own words about the attack took center stage ahead of Judge Victoria Rossetti's sentencing decision.",
      "They used the first day of the hearing to reveal parts of the trove of evidence prepared for trial, including key parts of Crimo's videotaped confession.",
      "In a recording of the police interview, which defense attorneys tried to have thrown out, a blank-faced Crimo slumped in a chair with arms crossed. He told officers that he briefly reconsidered the attack because of a problem with the gun. He later fixed the weapon.",
      "\u201cI walked up the stairs, jumped on the roof and opened fire,\u201d he said.",
      "Crimo was calm and cavalier, even laughing and joking, said Brian Bodden, a Highland Park police officer.",
      "Prosecutors recreated the horror of the day in the upscale community of about 30,000 people north of Chicago, showing video taken along the parade route and asking witnesses to recount the terrifying aftermath of the attack.",
      "In one video, a marching band played \u201cYou\u2019re a Grand Old Flag\u201d before shots were fired. Musicians carrying instruments ran as emergency sirens blared, fleeing along with other attendees.",
      "Many cried during the testimony, while others put their arms around each other inside the Lake County courtroom.",
      "The seven people killed were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Crimo\u2019s father, Robert Crimo Jr., a former mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct. He served less than two months in jail.",

      "Much of the recent market volatility is because of uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. Adding to some relief was Trump saying late Tuesday that he has \u201cno intention\u201d to fire the head of the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trump\u2019s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.",
      "While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Trump also said U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down \u201csubstantially\u201d from the current 145%.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that high, not going to be that high,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThere is an opportunity for a big deal here,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.",
      "All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will \u201cmore likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump\u2019s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,\u201d said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.",
      "The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration\u2019s officials continue to surprise markets.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning.",
      "Big Tech helped lead indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion.

      "The rally will take place one day before Trump\u2019s 100th day in office \u2014 a traditional early milestone in which a president's progress is measured against campaign promises. Michigan was one of the key battleground states Trump flipped last year from Democrats on his path back to the White House.",
      "Trump has not traveled much since taking office outside of personal weekend trips. His only other official trip in his second term was during the first week, when he visited disaster zones in North Carolina and California and held an event in Las Vegas to promote his plan to eliminate taxes on tips.",
      "But later this week, Trump will travel to Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, the first foreign trip in his second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s upcoming trip to Michigan follows a series of meetings and phone calls with the state\u2019s high-profile Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. Once a sharp critic of Trump, Whitmer has said that she hopes to find common ground with the president in his second term.",
      "A key area of potential cooperation that Whitmer has pointed to is Selfridge Air National Guard Base, long a concern for Whitmer and Michigan lawmakers amid uncertainty over its future as the A-10 aircraft stationed there are phased out.

      "The judge overseeing the sprawling $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit settlement involving the NCAA and the nation\u2019s five largest conferences has delayed final approval of the plan until it is modified to address concerns about roster limits",
      "The judge overseeing the rewriting of the college sports rulebook threw a potentially deal-wrecking roadblock into the mix Wednesday, insisting parties in the $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit redo the part of the proposed settlement involving roster limits that many schools are already putting in motion.",
      "\u201cAny disruption that may occur is a problem of Defendants\u2019 and NCAA members schools\u2019 own making,\u201d U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken wrote in a pointed five-page order in which she gave no weight to the argument that a reworking of the proposal could throw college sports into chaos.",
      "She gave the sides 14 days to contact their mediator and return to the bargaining table.",
      "The settlement in the landmark class-action lawsuit called for schools to no longer be bound by scholarship limits for their teams, but rather by roster limits in which everyone would be eligible for aid.",
      "It figured to ultimately weed out walk-ons, athletes on partial scholarships and, in extreme cases, entire teams. In preparing for the settlement to be approved, schools across the country have been busy cutting players who, in turn, were finding spots on new teams.",
      "Attorneys argued that undoing all those moves would add even more turbulence to an already tumultuous landscape.",
      "Not her problem, Wilken said, in insisting both sides jumped the gun in making the moves.",
      "\"The fact that the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement should not have been interpreted as an indication that it was certain that the Court would grant final approval,\" Wilken said of the preliminary nod she gave back in October that set these transactions in motion.",
      "While the attorneys look for a Plan B, the clock is ticking. Terms of the settlement were supposed to go into effect July 1. Football practice starts soon after. Whether rosters will come in at around the old average (128) or the newly prescribed limit (105) is an open question.",
      "One of the plaintiff attorneys, working virtually in lockstep with the NCAA and conferences since this settlement was (all but) locked in, released a daunting statement.",
      "\u201cWe will work hard to convince the NCAA and the conferences to address the court\u2019s concerns,\u201d Steve Berman said. \u201cIf we are unable to do so, then we are off to trial and we will return to fighting the NCAA in court with next steps.\u201d",
      "The NCAA and five defendant conferences released a joint statement saying they were closely reviewing the order.",
      "\u201cOur focus continues to be on securing approval of this significant agreement, which aims to create more opportunities than ever before for student-athletes while fostering much-needed stability and fairness in college sports,\u201d it said.",
      "Steven Molo, an attorney who represented more than 190 athletes at Wilken's hearing earlier this month, viewed the order as a victory of sorts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re grateful the court understood the pain the proposed settlement has been inflicting on many student-athletes who\u2019ve dedicated themselves to their sports,\u201d Molo said. \u201cThe tremendous unfairness of the arbitrary roster limits must be addressed.\"",
      "As for the rest of the settlement \u2014 including the $2.8 billion in back damages and the $20.5 million many schools can dole out to their athletes \u2014 Wilken said she's ready to go.",
      "But this has been portrayed all along as an all-or-nothing deal, and though it was a mere matter of routine, Wilken's release of a pretrial schedule \u2014 with some hearings scheduled out through September \u2014underscored the idea that, indeed, there's at least a chance this lawsuit could be resolved with a trial.",
      "Not that any of this should have surprised the attorneys.",
      "Wilken made clear toward the end of the daylong settlement hearing April 7 that she would like the parties to find a way to gradually implement the roster-limit rules. She suggested \u201cgrandfathering in\" athletes who already had roster spots. In her order Wednesday, she insisted that wasn't as impossible as the attorneys made it sound.",
      "\u201cOne way of achieving that could be to modify the settlement agreement to ensure that no (athletes) who have or had a roster spot will lose it as a result of the immediate implementation of the settlement agreement,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLimits could be accomplished gradually by attrition.\u201d",
      "Wilken also rejected attorneys' arguments that, essentially, the good being done for thousands of athletes who can now get paid (and who might have a previously unavailable shot at a scholarship) offsets whatever damage takes place to the players who find themselves at new schools \u2014 or no school at all.",
      "\u201cThe Court can approve the settlement agreement only if it is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering, in relevant part, whether it 'treats class members equitably relative to each other,'\u201d Wilken wrote, in quoting a previous ruling.",
      "It is not clear how many roster spots across hundreds of schools will vanish under the settlement, though some estimates have pegged the number in the thousands.",
      "What is sure is that this ruling shoves the schools' attempts at getting ready for 2025-26 a step deeper into a black hole of uncertainty. Also clear: the judge is every bit as concerned about the hundreds of athletes losing roster spots as she is with the multibillion-dollar industry they inhabit.",

      "A federal judge has found the U.S. government liable to the state of North Dakota for nearly $28 million in the state's lawsuit for recouping money spent on policing the protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Wednesday found the state of North Dakota entitled to nearly $28 million for responding to protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 a win for the state in its multiyear effort to recoup the costs from the federal government.",
      "The state filed the lawsuit in 2019, seeking $38 million for policing the protests. The sometimes-chaotic demonstrations drew international attention for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline\u2019s Missouri River crossing upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline, fearing an oil spill polluting its water supply.",
      "A trial played out over several weeks in early 2024 in federal court in Bismarck, the state capital. People who testified included former North Dakota governors Doug Burgum, who took office in December 2016 during the protests\u2019 height, and Jack Dalrymple, whose administration responded to the protests\u2019 early months.",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor found the United States liable to the state on all claims and for more than $27.8 million in damages.",
      "The judge wrote: \u201cThe bottom line: United States had a mandatory procedure, it did not follow that procedure, and harm occurred to the state of North Dakota. The law allows reimbursement for this harm. More than that, the rule of law requires this Court to hold the United States liable to remind it of its role in the larger picture of ensuring peace, not chaos.\u201d",
      "Thousands of people camped and demonstrated against the pipeline near the crossing for months, resulting in hundreds of arrests. Sometimes-violent clashes occurred between protesters and law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers from around the state and region responded to the protests.",
      "The protest camps were cleared in February 2017. An attorney for the state said the protests ended in a response of more than seven months involving 178 agencies, resulting in 761 arrests and requiring four days of cleanup of the camp to remove millions of pounds of trash.",
      "In a joint statement, Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley said: \u201cAs outlined in trial testimony and Judge Traynor\u2019s ruling, decisions made by the Obama administration emboldened protestors and ultimately caused millions of dollars in damage to North Dakota, while endangering the health and safety of North Dakota communities, families and law enforcement officers who responded to the protests.\u201d",
      "The state's claims included negligence, gross negligence, civil trespass and public nuisance.",
      "Attorneys for the government said at trial that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials \u201cacted reasonably given limited options at their disposal\u201d during the protests, and that the state's claim is \u201cgreatly overstated.\" The government asked the judge to find a lack of legal jurisdiction for the state's claims, that the state hasn't proven its claims and is not entitled to damages.",
      "The Associated Press sent an email to an attorney who argued for the federal government at trial seeking comment.",
      "The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017. Many state government officials and industry leaders support the pipeline as crucial infrastructure in the country\u2019s No. 3 oil-producing state. The pipeline carries roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.",
      "In 2017, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer, donated $15 million to help cover the response costs. That same year, the U.S. Justice Department gave a $10 million grant to the state for reimbursing the response. The judge found the former to be a gift and reduced the latter from the state's total recovery.",
      "Then-President Donald Trump denied a 2017 request from the state for the federal government to cover the costs through a disaster declaration.",
      "The pipeline is operating while a court-ordered environmental review of the river crossing is carried out.",
      "A North Dakota jury recently found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims brought by the pipeline's builder in connection with protest activities, with damages surpassing $660 million against three Greenpeace organizations.",

      "\u201cFor more than two years, Norfolk Southern has paid the costs related to the derailment while acknowledging and acting on our own responsibility for the accident. Our belief has always been that other companies, like GATX, who share in that responsibility should also be held to account,\u201d the railroad said in a statement.",
      "After the train derailed in East Palestine, an assortment of chemicals spilled and caught fire. Then three days later, officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride because they feared those cars might explode, generating a massive black plume of smoke that spread over the area and forcing evacuations.",
      "Norfolk Southern lost a similar lawsuit last year when it tried to force GATX and OxyVinyls, which made the vinyl chloride, to help pay for the environmental cleanup after the derailment that has cost the Atlanta-based railroad more than $1 billion. It made similar arguments in this trial.",
      "These lawsuits have no effect on how much money residents or the village of East Palestine will receive from their settlements with the railroad. This cases only affect which company writes the check.",
      "Last week, OxyVinyls agreed to a settlement with Norfolk Southern in this lawsuit over the class-action settlement after the railroad's lawyers raised questions about the inconsistent information the chemical company provided about whether it was necessary to perform the vent-and-burn operation and release the vinyl chloride. The details of that settlement weren't released.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed in its investigation that the vent-and-burn operation was unnecessary because the tank cars were starting to cool off and the railroad failed to listen to the advice from OxyVinyls\u2019 experts or share their opinions with the officials who made the decision.",
      "The railroad said GATX should have done more to take care of its railcar, particularly after it was surrounded by floodwaters, which could have damaged its bearings.",
      "But GATX said it complied with all the relevant regulations for taking care of its railcars. The company said that even if the car was damaged six years earlier by standing parked in the middle of floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey, the railroad should have spotted the problem and repaired it, sending GATX the bill for the repairs.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said the crash was caused by the failure of an overheating bearing on GATX\u2019s railcar. The railroad\u2019s sensors spotted the bearing starting to heat up in the miles before the derailment, but it didn\u2019t reach a critical temperature and trigger an alarm until just before the derailment. That left the crew little time to stop the train.",

Gavin Newsom's office announced Wednesday that 1,000 zero-emission school buses and related charging infrastructure will be provided to over 130 rural, low-income and disadvantaged school districts.

      "\u201cThe order properly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\u201d the court said.",
      "The administration conceded it made a mistake in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. But it argued that it no longer could do anything about trying to bring him back. Officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime. His lawyers have said there is no evidence that he is a member of MS-13 or any gang.",

      "In 2020, Xinis issued a preliminary injunction halting portions of immigration rules enacted under the first Trump administration that would have limited people seeking asylum in the U.S. from being able to obtain authorization to work.",

      "Xinis won support from Republican leaders, including the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But some conservatives felt Xinis was too tough on law enforcement in her legal career. They cited her record as an examiner for the Office of Police Complaints in Washington, a civilian oversight entity.",

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., had noted that her law firm had represented the family of Freddie Gray, who died a year earlier after his neck was broken while he was handcuffed and shackled in the back of a Baltimore police van. Gray\u2019s death prompted riots in that city, and his case has been frequently mentioned in the national conversation about police brutality.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview released Wednesday that Iran must give up all nuclear enrichment if it wants to make a deal during talks with the Trump administration and head off the threat of armed conflict.",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian energy use and says it does not seek to make weapons-grade uranium to build atomic bombs.",
      "\u201cIf Iran wants a civil nuclear program, they can have one just like many other countries can have one, and that is they import enriched material,\u201d Rubio said in a podcast interview with journalist Bari Weiss.",
      "But Iran has long refused to give up its ability to enrich uranium. President Donald Trump in his first term pulled the U.S. out of a Obama-era nuclear deal focused on monitoring to ensure Iran did not move toward weapons-grade enrichment.",
      "In the first months of his second term, Trump opened talks that he says will get a tougher agreement on Iran's nuclear program, with a second round of negotiations held Saturday and technical-level talks expected this weekend. Iran wants the easing of sanctions that have damaged its economy and is facing threatened Israeli or U.S. strikes aimed at disabling its nuclear program by force.",
      "\"I would tell anyone we\u2019re a long ways from any sort of agreement with Iran,\" Rubio noted. \u201cIt may not be possible, we don't know ... but we would want to achieve a peaceful resolution to this and not resort to anything else.\"",
      "With the region already embroiled in war, he said that \u201cany military action at this point in the Middle East, whether it\u2019s against Iran by us or anybody else, could in fact trigger a much broader conflict.\u201d",
      "Although Trump \"reserves every right to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, he\u2019d prefer peace,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Trump's lead representative in the recently revived talks, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, initially suggested the U.S. was open to allowing Iran to continue low-level uranium enrichment.",
      "Many American conservatives and Israel, which wants Iran's nuclear facilities destroyed, objected. Witkoff issued what the Trump administration described as a clarification, saying, \u201cIran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded that his country must be able to enrich. \u201cThe core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable,\u201d he said.",
      "Standard international agreements for civilian nuclear programs have the U.S. and international community help governments develop nuclear power for energy and other peaceful uses in exchange for them swearing off making their own nuclear fuel, because of the threat that capacity could be used for weapons.",
      "Also Wednesday, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran has agreed to allow in a technical team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency in coming days to discuss restoring camera surveillance at nuclear sites and other issues.",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, speaking to reporters in Washington after meeting with Iranian officials in Tehran last week, said that while the move was not directly linked to the U.S. talks, it was an encouraging sign of Iran\u2019s willingness to reach terms in a potential deal.",
      "Iranian leaders were engaged \u201cwith a sense of trying to get to an agreement,\" Grossi said. \u201cThat is my impression.\u201d",
      "After Trump exited the nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, Iran responded by curtailing monitoring by the IAEA at nuclear sites. It has pressed ahead on enriching and stockpiling uranium that is closer to weapons-grade levels, the agency says.",
      "The IAEA is not playing a direct role in the new talks, and Trump's Republican administration has not asked it to, Grossi told reporters.",
      "But when it comes to ensuring Iranian compliance with any deal, he said, \u201cthis will have to be verified by the IAEA.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cannot imagine how you could put ... a corps of invented international or national inspectors to inspect Iran\u201d without having the agency's decades of expertise, he said. \u201cI think it would be problematic and strange.\u201d",

Harmony Montgomery suffered from a ripple effect of \u201cmiscalculations of risk and unequal weight placed on parents\u2019 rights versus a child\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d said Maria Mossaides, head of Massachusetts\u2019 Office of the Child Advocate.",
      "Harmony Montgomery wasn\u2019t made a priority in her own legal case, the report said, as neither the judge nor the attorneys put her medical, behavioral and educational needs or safety at the forefront of custody discussions. The report also said they did not enforce requirements that govern the placement of children from one state into another.",
      "Filmmaker Bill Lichtenstein, with the support of several media outlets including The Associated Press, sued to gain access to recordings of the closed-door custody hearing to better understand how Adam Montgomery got custody of his daughter, despite having a long criminal record. Normally, family court hearings are sealed due to privacy concerns.",
      "Lichtenstein says he wants the audio for a documentary about secrecy in Massachusetts\u2019 child protection and juvenile court systems.",
      "The state Supreme Judicial Court agreed that releasing the audio, \u201cmay help to better inform the public both about what happened to this child specifically and whether there are steps the child welfare system generally can take to minimize the possibility of repeating this tragedy.\u201d",
      "The court said names of Adam Montgomery's other children would be redacted from the recordings.",
      "Lichtenstein said the decision \u201cbrings sunlight to these vital issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cA significant impediment to protecting children in the Massachusetts foster court and juvenile court systems has been their absolute unconditional secrecy,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment on the ruling, a spokesperson said. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Adam Montgomery\u2019s estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, testified that her family had been evicted right before Thanksgiving in 2019 and were living in a car. Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car, she said.",
      "After that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag. She described various places where the girl\u2019s body was hidden, including the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent at a homeless center and the walk-in freezer at her husband\u2019s workplace.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked North Carolina election officials from contacting voters whose disputed ballots in an unresolved 2024 state Supreme Court race could be eliminated from the final count.",
      "In a 2-1 decision, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, granted the stay request of Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs, who has asked federal judges to throw out the recent rulings of state appellate courts that largely favored Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin's requests to toss ballots that he challenged.",
      "Democrats and voting rights groups have raised alarm about Griffin's effort, calling it an attack on democracy that would serve as a road map for the GOP to reverse future election results in other states. The state Republican Party says Griffin's efforts are about ensuring that only legal votes are counted.",
      "The court's decision late Tuesday means government election workers are prohibited \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from carrying out a process mandated by state judges who ruled earlier this month that voters within two categories were ineligible. Most of these military or overseas voters, once contacted formally, would get 30 days to provide additional identifying information so that their race choices would remain in the tally. Others, however, would be unable to \u201ccure\u201d their ineligibility and their ballots would be removed.",
      "Riggs leads Griffin by just 734 votes from more than 5.5 million ballots cast in what is the nation\u2019s last undecided race from November's general election. The stay keeps these numbers in place while Riggs and her allies seek a federal trial judge to declare it would be unlawful to remove any of these ballots from the totals.",
      "After two recounts appeared to confirm a Riggs victory, Griffin soon after the Nov. 5 election filed protests that grew to more than 65,000 ballots. Ensuing state court rulings whittled down the total to as few as 1,675 ballots or perhaps as much as 7,000, according to court filings. Actual totals are still being hashed out in state court. The fewer the ballots that could be potentially removed, the likely tougher it would be for Griffin to overtake Riggs.",
      "Attorneys for Riggs and other groups seeking Tuesday's stay told the 4th Circuit that without it, mailings going out soon to affected voters would only increase voter confusion, especially if federal courts later overturn the state court decision.",
      "Tuesday's prevailing order from U.S. Circuit Judges Paul Niemeyer and Toby Heytens said granting a stay was proper while U.S. District Judge Richard Myers rules on claims by Riggs, the State Board of Elections and others that the U.S. Constitution and federal voting laws prevent the ballots from being canceled.",
      "\u201cWe enjoin the North Carolina State Board of Elections from mailing any notice to any potentially affected voter pending the district court\u2019s resolution of Riggs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction,\u201d the order reads.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. said that Myers committed no error by simply ordering previously that the state board not certify any outcome in the race while he considers legal arguments. Quattlebaum was an appointee of President Donald Trump. Heytens and Niemeyer were appointed by Presidents Joe Biden and George H.W. Bush, respectively.",
      "Riggs campaign spokesperson Dory MacMillan said the motion pauses \u201ca confusing and burdensome cure process for ballots that had nothing wrong with them\" and \"we\u2019re confident that federal law prohibits these votes from being thrown out.\u201d",
      "Griffin's lawyers argued the stay request should have been denied and say federal courts should let stand state court decisions that remove votes from ineligible voters.",
      "\u201cWe expect the litigation of this case to continue for some time,\" Griffin campaign spokesperson Paul Shumaker said Wednesday. \"The ruling only further delays an outcome.\u201d",
      "One category of ballots that state appeals courts declared shouldn't be counted were cast by overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were declared North Carolina residents.",
      "The other disallowed category covers military or overseas voters who did not provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form with their absentee ballots. Election officials have been told to notify these voters and tell them they could turn in an ID copy or exception form within 30 days for their vote to count.",
      "Griffin, who is a state Court of Appeals judge, and Riggs have not participated in deliberations in their respective courts about their election.",

      "Now, his message is different.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d said Osborn, who owns Fox Run Vineyards, a sprawling 50-acre (20-hectare) farm on Seneca Lake, the largest of New York\u2019s Finger Lakes.",
      "It\u2019s becoming riskier to grow grapes in the state\u2019s prominent winemaking region. Harvests like Osborn\u2019s are increasingly endangered by unpredictable weather from climate change. Attitudes on wine are shifting. Political tensions, such as tariffs amid President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars and the administration\u2019s rollback of environmental policies, are also looming problems.",
      "Despite the challenges, however, many winegrowers are embracing sustainable practices, wanting to be part of the solution to global warming while hoping they can adapt to changing times.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "The Finger Lakes, which span a large area of western New York, have water that can sparkle and give off a sapphire hue on sunny days. More than 130 wineries dot the shorelines and offer some of America\u2019s most famous white wines.",
      "At Fox Run, visitors step inside to sip wines and bring a bottle \u2014 or two \u2014 home. Many are longtime customers, like Michele Magda and her husband, who have frequently made the trip from Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cThis is like a little escape, a little getaway,\u201d she said.",
      "Traditionally, the plants\u2019 buds break out in spring, emerging with colorful grapes that range from the cabernet franc\u2019s deep blues to the soft greens of the region\u2019s most popular grape, riesling. However, a warming world is making that happen earlier, adding to uncertainty and potential risks for farmers. If a frost comes after the buds have broken, growers can lose much of the harvest.",
      "Year-round rain and warmer night temperatures differentiate the Finger Lakes from its West Coast competitors, said Paul Brock, a viticulture and wine technology professor at Finger Lakes Community College. Learning to adapt to those fluctuations has given local winemakers a competitive advantage, he said.",
      "Globally, vineyards are grappling with the impacts of increasingly unpredictable weather. In France, record rainfall and harsh weather have spelled trouble for winegrowers trying their best to adapt. Along the West Coast, destructive wildfires are worsening wine quality.",
      "Many winegrowers say they are working to make their operations more sustainable, wanting to help solve climate change caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline, coal and natural gas.",
      "Farms can become certified under initiatives such as the New York Sustainable Winegrowing program. Fox Run and more than 50 others are certified, which requires that growers improve practices like bettering soil health and protecting water quality of nearby lakes.",
      "Beyond the rustic metal gate featuring the titular foxes, some of Osborn\u2019s sustainability initiatives come into view.",
      "Hundreds of solar panels powering 90% of the farm\u2019s electricity are the most obvious feature. Other initiatives are more subtle, like underground webs of fungi used to insulate crops from drought and disease.",
      "\u201cWe all have to do something,\u201d Osborn said.",
      "For Suzanne Hunt and her family\u2019s 7th-generation vineyard, doing something about climate change means devoting much of their efforts to sustainability.",
      "Hunt Country Vineyards, along Keuka Lake, took on initiatives like using underground geothermal pipelines for heating and cooling, along with composting. Despite the forward-looking actions, climate change is one of the factors forcing the family to make tough decisions about their future.",
      "Devastating frosts in recent years have caused \u201ccatastrophic\u201d crop loss. They\u2019ve also had to reconcile with changing consumer attitudes, as U.S. consumption of wine fell over the past few years, according to wine industry advocacy group Wine Institute.",
      "By this year\u2019s end, the vineyard will stop producing wine and instead will hold community workshops and sell certain grape varieties.",
      "\u201cThe farm and the vineyard, you know, it\u2019s part of me,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019ll let the people whose dream and life is to make wine do that part, and I\u2019ll happily support them.\u201d",
      "Vinny Aliperti, owner of Billsboro Winery along Seneca Lake, is working to improve the wine industry\u2019s environmental footprint. In the past year, he\u2019s helped establish communal wine bottle dumpsters that divert the glass from entering landfills and reuse it for construction materials.",
      "But Aliperti said he\u2019d like to see more nearby wineries and vineyards in sustainability efforts. The wine industry\u2019s longevity depends on it, especially under a presidential administration that doesn\u2019t seem to have sustainability at top of mind, he said.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all a bit scared, frankly, a bit, I mean, depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see very good things coming out of the next four years in terms of the environment.\u201d",
      "Osborn is bracing for sweeping cuts to federal environmental policies that previously made it easier to fund sustainability initiatives. Tax credits for Osborn\u2019s solar panels made up about half of over $400,000 in upfront costs, in addition to some state and federal grants. Osborn wants to increase his solar production, but he said he won\u2019t have enough money without those programs.",
      "Fox Run could also lose thousands of dollars from retaliatory tariffs and boycotts of American wine from his Canadian customers. In March, Canada introduced 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods \u2014 including wine.",
      "Osborn fears he can\u2019t compete with larger wine-growing states like California, which may flood the American market to make up for lost customers abroad. Smaller vineyards in the Finger Lakes might not survive these economic pressures, he said.",
      "Back at Fox Run's barrel room, Aric Bryant, a decade-long patron, says all the challenges make him even more supportive of New York wines.",
      "\u201cI have this, like, fierce loyalty,\u201d he said. \"I go to restaurants around here and if they don\u2019t have Finger Lakes wines on their menu, I\u2019m like, \u2018What are you even doing serving wine?\u2019\u201d",

A representative of Mahdawi and a Justice Department lawyer did not immediately respond to an emailed request for the document Wednesday morning.",
      "Mahdawi had attended his interview, answered questions and signed a document that he was willing to defend the U.S. Constitution and laws of the nation.",
      "\u201cIt was a trap,\u201d his lawyers said.",
      "They said masked ICE agents entered the interview room, shackled Mahdawi, and put him in a car. A judge later issued an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "Mahdawi is still scheduled for a hearing date in immigration court in Louisiana on May 1, his attorneys said. His notice to appear says he is removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act because the Secretary of State has determined his presence and activities \"would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\u201d",
      "Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.",

      "An Indian company that spreads crushed rock on farmers' fields to help draw climate-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere has been awarded a $50 million grand prize in a global competition funded by Elon Musk's foundation.",
      "Mati Carbon was among more than 1,300 teams from 88 countries that participated in the four-year XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition, launched in 2021 to encourage deployment of carbon-removal technologies. Many scientists believe removing carbon is crucial in the fight against global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like gasoline, coal and oil, which release carbon dioxide.",
      "\u201cIt's important that we not promote carbon dioxide removal as a replacement for emissions reduction,\u201d said Michael Leitch, the technical lead for the competition. \u201cBut the race is really on both to dramatically reduce our existing emissions (and) also ... deploy carbon dioxide removal solutions at very, very large scales globally.\u201d",
      "The prize is being awarded at a time when Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency are making steep cuts to federal funding and staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Weather Service and other science-based agencies that carry out important climate research. The Trump administration has also moved to roll back myriad environmental regulations, including some that regulate carbon emissions.",
      "While the Musk Foundation sponsored XPRIZE Carbon Removal, which distributed a total of $100 million, it is not formally affiliated with the California-based organization, XPRIZE officials said.",
      "XPRIZE runs other contests to try to solve societal challenges. Executive director Nikki Batchelor said the organization is considering more climate-related competitions addressing such issues as removal of the potent greenhouse gas methane, reforestation and climate adaptation and resilience.",
      "Mati Carbon CEO Shantanu Agarwal believes his company's relatively low-cost approach \u201chas a potential to really solve some planetary scale problems\u201d while helping small farmers who often bear the brunt of climate change, as extreme weather events like drought and floods destroy crops.",
      "The method, called enhanced rock weathering, is fairly straightforward, said Jake Jordan, the company's chief science officer: When it rains, water and carbon dioxide mix in the atmosphere, forming carbonic acid, which falls on rock and eventually breaks it down into small bits of silica. The carbonic acid is converted to a mineral called bicarbonate, which cannot re-gas to the atmosphere and eventually is washed to the ocean, where it is stored for about 10,000 years.",
      "Mati Carbon spreads already-crushed basalt rock \u2014 plentiful in many parts of the world \u2014 on the fields \u201cto speed up something that happens anyway,\u201d Jordan said. The crushed rock also releases nutrients that help regenerate soils and increase productivity.",
      "Smaller prizes were awarded in the competition\u2019s final year to several other teams that also successfully removed 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide, a threshold that demonstrates an ability to scale up to remove gigatons in the coming decades.",
      "That included $15 million to runner-up NetZero, which turns crop residues such as coffee husks into biochar, charcoal-like particles that can be used on fields to help store carbon in soils while also improving nutrient and water retention.",
      "Other projects involved storing organic waste deep underground, enhancing oceans' ability to store carbon and removing carbon directly from the air.",
      "Scientists have been exploring the gamut of so-called geoengineering solutions to climate change, from drying the upper atmosphere to pumping minerals into the ocean to absorb carbon.",
      "Rick Spinrad, former administrator at NOAA, called the finalists' solutions \u201cscientifically extraordinary concepts\u201d and said the best approach to reducing carbon probably will be a combination of technologies.",
      "Leitch, from XPRIZE, said some solutions that did not win \u2014 including direct air and direct ocean capture of carbon dioxide \u2014 might have an advantage when deployed on a large scale.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot of time and money to build, so I think time will tell,\u201d Leitch said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is quietly revoking the temporary legal status of people who entered the country via an online appointment app at U.S. border crossings with Mexico",
      "McALLEN, Texas -- Hubert Montoya burst out laughing when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security emailed to say he should leave the country immediately or risk consequences of being deported. He is a U.S. citizen.",
      "\u201cI just thought it was absurd,\u201d the Austin, Texas, immigration attorney said.",
      "It was an apparent glitch in the Trump administration's dismantling of another Biden-era policy that allowed people to live and work in the country temporarily. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is quietly revoking two-year permits of people who used an online appointment app at U.S. border crossings with Mexico called CBP One, which brought in more than 900,000 people starting in January 2023.",
      "The revocation of CBP One permits has lacked the fanfare and formality of canceling Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands whose homelands were previously deemed unsafe for return and humanitarian parole for others from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came with financial sponsors. Those moves came with official notices in the Federal Register and press releases. Judges halted them from taking effect after advocacy groups sued.",
      "CBP One cancellation notices began landing in inboxes in late March without warning, some telling recipients to leave immediately and others giving them seven days. Targets included U.S. citizens.",
      "Timothy J. Brenner, a Connecticut-born lawyer in Houston, was told April 11 to leave the U.S. \u201cI became concerned that the administration has a list of immigration attorneys or a database that they\u2019re trying to target to harass,\u201d he said.",
      "CBP confirmed in a statement that it issued notices terminating temporary legal status under CBP One. It did not say how many, just that they weren't sent to all beneficiaries, which totaled 936,000 at the end of December.",
      "CBP said notices may have been sent to unintended recipients, including attorneys, if beneficiaries provided contact information for U.S. citizens. It is addressing those situations case-by-case.",
      "Online chat groups reflect fear and confusion, which, according to critics, is the administration's intended effect. Brenner said three clients who received the notices chose to return to El Salvador after being told to leave.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know how many people got this notice is part of the problem. We\u2019re getting reports from attorneys and folks who don\u2019t know what to make of the notice,\u201d said Hillary Li, counsel for the Justice Action Center, an advocacy group.",
      "President Donald Trump suspended CBP One for new arrivals his first day in office but those already in the U.S. believed they could stay at least until their two-year permits expired. The cancellation notices that some received ended that sense of temporary stability. \u201cIt is time for you to leave the United States,\u201d the letters began.",
      "\u201cIt's really confusing,\u201d said Robyn Barnard, senior director for refugee advocacy at Human Rights First. \u201cImagine how people who entered through that process feel when they're hearing through their different community chats, rumors or screenshots that some friends have received notice and others didn't.\u201d",
      "Attorneys say some CBP One beneficiaries may still be within a one-year window to file an asylum claim or seek other relief.",
      "Notices have been sent to others whose removal orders are on hold under other forms of temporary protection. A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily halted deportations for more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came since late 2022 after applying online with a financial sponsor and flying to a U.S. airport at their own expense.",
      "Maria, a 48-year-old Nicaraguan woman who cheered Trump's election and arrived via that path, said the notice telling her to leave landed like \u201ca bomb. It paralyzed me.\u201d",
      "Maria, who asked to be named only by her middle name for fear of being detained and deported, said in a telephone interview from Florida that she would continue cleaning houses to support herself and file for asylum.",

    "summary": "Retailers argue that cheap foreign rivals are undercutting business using a tax-free status on small parcels.",
    "story": [
      "Major retailers have welcomed the government's review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.",
      "The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Former Dragon's Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC the measure was ruining UK High Streets.",
      "Some retailers have argued they are being undercut by overseas rival, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and price rises for customers.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.",
      "The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.",
      "It has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had had devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".",
      "He joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.",
      "UK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.",
      "Aside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.",
      "DHL suspends high value US deliveries over tariffs",
      "Shein and Temu warn tariffs will raise prices in US",
      "The so called \"de mimimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China.",
      "Goods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.",
      "In the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on Chinese goods.",
      "Earlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".",
      "But the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in tis de minimus consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".",
      "\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the \u00a3135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.",
      "\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.",
      "'Absolute nonsense'",
      "Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.",
      "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".",
      "When Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.",
      "\"Everyone should pay their tax... so if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said."

      "Energy secretary Ed Miliband is \"considering\" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that would give discounts to homes near infrastructure.",
      "On Thursday, the Daily Telegraph reported the government was \"poised\" to implement zonal pricing, which would split the country's single national power market into different regions and charge southern England households more for energy.",
      "Miliband dismissed the story as \"nonsense,\" saying he would not approve a plan that led to bills being increased in some parts of the country.",
      "But he did confirm that the government was looking to shake-up the energy market, which he said could involve \"zonal pricing and reformed national pricing\".",

      "The UK government is currently exploring options for major reform in the electricity market.",
      "According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",
      "Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.",
      "But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a \"terrible idea\" as \"tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now\".",
      "Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted \"absolutely no decision has been made\".",
      "\"This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.",
      "\"Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.",
      "\"We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.\"",
      "Can I fix my energy prices?",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans \"a form of bribery\", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects \"ruining\" the local area.",
      "\"None of this I think has been fully thought through,\" he argued.",
      "\"I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.\"",
      "The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Greens have been contacted for a response."

      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

      "It means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months.",

      "\"Learner drivers have been dealing with frustratingly long waiting times to book a driving test since the easing of pandemic related restrictions several years ago,\" she said.",

      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",

      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The US dollar has seen big declines in recent months.",
      "Currencies rise and fall all the time but the recent drop in the dollar has been particularly dramatic.",
      "So why has the dollar been falling and why does it matter?",
      "What has happened to the dollar since Trump was elected?",
      "The dollar was rising in the autumn in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election off the back of relatively strong US economic growth, and continued to strengthen after Trump's victory in November on hopes he might extend that trend.",
      "Talk of his trade policy also had an effect, as many investors thought the tariffs that he promised to bring in would push up inflation, forcing the US central bank, the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or at least not cut them as fast as expected.",
      "The prospect of higher rates in the US makes the dollar more attractive as it means investors will make more money on their cash in dollars compared to other currencies.",
      "But the calculus has shifted in recent months as the details of his tariffs have emerged - often followed by pauses or, in the case of China, extensions - leaving much uncertainty surrounding the impact they will have.",
      "US growth is now widely expected to weaken.",
      "That has had a knock-on impact on the dollar, which has seen steep falls. Trump's attacks on Fed chief Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates also appear to have added pressure to the greenback.",
      "The value of all currencies goes up and down influenced by many factors such as inflation expectations and central bank policies.",
      "But the dollar index, which measures its strength against a set of currencies, has fallen to its lowest level for three years.",
      "US stocks and dollar plunge as Trump attacks Fed chair Powell",
      "Is this unusual?",
      "The dollar is usually seen as a safe investment in troubled times.",
      "So the sharp drops in the currency - as well as the recent sell-off in US government bonds, also generally considered a safe US asset - are unusual.",
      "The fall in the dollar after Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement was \"quite shocking\", says Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange (FX) strategy at Rabobank.",
      "\"For several years, the market's been buying this US growth story, the US stock market's been outperforming other stock markets, and suddenly you had economists thinking tariffs would push the US into recession,\" she says, pointing to the massive sell-off of US stocks, US bonds and the dollar.",
      "That has raised speculation about whether the drop might signal a more far-reaching turn away from the US, as well as away from the dollar.",
      "What does a weaker dollar mean?",
      "The first time ordinary Americans might notice a weaker dollar is when they go abroad, as their money will not go as far. While foreign tourists in the US will find their currency will buy them more.",
      "But movements in the dollar also have a massive impact internationally, more so than swings in other currencies do.",
      "That's because it is the world's primary reserve currency, meaning it is held by central banks around the world in large quantities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Central banks use US dollars in international transactions, to pay for international debt, or to support domestic exchange rates.",
      "The dollar is also the main currency used in international trade, with around half of world trade invoices done in US dollars, says Jane Foley.",
      "A fall in the dollar means US goods exports become cheaper. But imported goods may become more expensive due to the weaker currency, as well as any direct impact from tariffs.",
      "Many commodities that trade internationally, such as oil and gas, are also priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes crude oil cheaper for countries that hold other currencies.",
      "What happens if the dollar keeps falling?",
      "In the US a strong dollar has been seen as a symbol of American political might.",
      "The very idea that it might lose its status as the world's reserve currency has been unthinkable.",
      "Ms Foley says that while other currencies may become more important, the dollar won't lose its number one status any time soon, although one Federal Reserve official suggested last year that the US can no longer take this for granted.",
      "Ms Foley thinks the dollar will win back some ground over the next few weeks but will not get back to where it was.",
      "That's because with very significant market moves, there's always the possibility of profit taking. For instance, if investors decide to sell euros while they're trading strongly, that could lead to the euro falling and the dollar rising.",
      "The markets will be watching this week to see if Trump continues his attack on the head of the Federal Reserve. He has called Mr Powell \"a major loser\" and has publicly called for his \"termination\".",
      "If there is pressure on Powell to leave office, the markets will start to wonder about the Fed's credibility, something which is seen as crucial.",
      "\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown."

      "The predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.",

      "In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% levies on US products.",

      "Uncertainty around trade policy was a \"major factor\" behind the growth downgrades, Mr Gourinchas said.",
      "\"Faced with increased uncertainty... many firms' initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment and cut purchases.\"",
      "The IMF predicts the global economy will grow by 2.8% this year, down from its previous forecast of 3.3%, and by 3.0% in 2026.",
      "The downgrade to the US growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending, the IMF said. Tariffs are also expected to hit growth in 2026.",
      "The IMF said there was now a 40% probability of a US recession this year, higher than its estimate of 25% in October last year.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, banking group the Institute of International Finance said it expected \"a shallow recession\" in the US later this year, with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.",
      "China is expected to grow by 4% this year, down from the IMF's previous estimate of 4.6%.",
      "In the UK, the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs, higher government borrowing costs, and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs.",
      "However, the IMF's 2025 prediction for the UK is now close to the 1% growth forecast by the government's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) last month. The IMF expects the UK to grow by 1.4% next year.",
      "Responding to the forecast, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European G7 country due to \"reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK\".",
      "Reeves added that \"the world has changed\" and she would be in Washington this week \"defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade\".",

      "Mr Gourinchas said that while the reference forecast was the IMF's central scenario, \"many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries\".",
      "The IMF also looked at the situation after the US temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on China sharply.",

      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",
      "However, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",

      "Only it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome.",
      "Parents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve?",
      "England's childcare deserts",
      "Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing.",
      "The government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours.",
      "A report by the regulator and inspector of early years, Ofsted, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare.",
      "Doncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children.",
      "For Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky.",
      "\"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\"",
      "Olena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says.",
      "\"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\"",
      "Childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said.",
      "\"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\"",
      "Are school-based nurseries the solution?",
      "One of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools.",
      "Analysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\".",
      "It will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed.",
      "Some 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September.",
      "Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".",
      "\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"",
      "But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.",
      "Private nurseries are facing 'huge increases'",
      "There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.",
      "Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.",
      "The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.",
      "But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subsidise it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.",
      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "\"I absolutely hate just sitting down with a laptop or book and just working,\" says Ben. \"But I think it's the best way for information to get into me.\"",
      "His GCSE results comprised mostly of the top grades of 7s, 8s and 9s. He loves maths and physics - something his sisters find hard to understand.",
      "He's sitting A-levels this summer, before taking a year out to decide between an apprenticeship or university.",
      "He and older sister Emma both say that doing past papers and applying their revision to the questions has really helped with their study in the past.",
      "\"If I'm not doing questions to apply it, it just doesn't go in,\" Ben says.",
      "But what works for one student may not work for others, and expert Stevie suggests that thinking creatively about how your child can revise is a good idea - think flashcards, mind maps or even YouTube videos.",
      "\"I love flash cards - they're so easy and quick,\" says youngest daughter Jess.",
      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",
      "3. Stay connected to what you love",
      "When we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.",
      "\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"",
      "For Emma, reading or walks with her mum, dad and their dog Maisie was important time to carve out during A-levels.",
      "It's basketball for Jess, who is worried that her current knee injury means she won't be able to play to relax during her GCSE exams.",
      "\"Now I just come home and nap,\" she says.",
      "She says she's feeling the pressure with her GCSE grades, as not only does she need them for basketball college here, but her dreams of basketball college in the US for university afterwards rely on them too.",
      "Their brother Ben enjoys playing on his Xbox with friends, but says he drags himself back downstairs to do work when he realises he has been ignoring his revision a little too long.",
      "As a lot of exams rely on memory, expert Stevie says that staying hydrated, eating healthily, exercising, and having time to do the things we love can help us look after our brains.",
      "Time with your favourite TV show or even a scroll through TikTok can also help to find that balance.",
      "4. Avoid distractions",
      "You can't have too much of a good thing.",
      "Phones can help us to stay connected to friends and family during tough times, but they can also be distracting.",
      "\"I have to hide my phone underneath books or behind my laptop,\" says Emma. \"If I see it, I'll just go on it.\"",
      "When asked how she will avoid the distraction of her phone during her GCSE exams, younger sister Jess says she \"hasn't worked that one out yet\".",
      "Dad Steve has offered to take it away - if Jess wants him to - in order to help her focus.",
      "\"I don't think anyone is going to learn if they're being forced to sit in a room with someone standing over them, or with the threat of: 'We're going to take your phone away,'\" he says.",
      "\"It's tricky.\"",

      "Revision and exams: How to be resilient",
      "5. Validate worries and be reassuring",
      "Sometimes it can be tempting to say to people: \"Don't worry, it'll be fine.\"",
      "But that can invalidate their feelings, says expert Stevie.",
      "\"We're all guilty of saying it and it comes often from a very good place,\" she says.",
      "\"But for that young person there is a very valid worry there.\"",
      "Instead, she suggests acknowledging the worry, and saying something like: \"I can absolutely hear that you are worried, and it's completely natural in exams, but you've put so much time and energy into revision.",
      "\"You've worked so hard and whatever happens, we'll be here to support you.\"",
      "What about when it all goes wrong?",
      "\"I think when things are getting tough, just step away from it,\" says teacher and dad Steve.",
      "\"Staying healthy - mentally healthy and physically healthy - has to be the most important thing.\"",
      "When tensions are high at home around revision and exams, arguments may happen. Stevie from Young Minds says that walking away and having a cooling off period is essential.",
      "\"Once people have cooled down, you can reflect, say that you understand why they are feeling so frustrated, and ask if there's anything you can do to support them.\"",
      "And when it's all over?",
      "\"I think something we'd definitely say as teachers is that it's not a good idea to come out of an exam and stand in a big group of people and hear what everyone else wrote,\" says Steve.",
      "And his daughter Emma agrees.",
      "\"I just walked out by myself, got my bag and went home,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not ruining this, goodbye!'\"",
      "\"It's just a great feeling of relief after you've done the exam,\" adds Ben.",
      "With exams around the corner, the Jolleys are also keeping an eye on what they have to look forward to after it's all finished.",
      "Trips to Malta, Croatia and Magaluf are on the horizon, as well as a school prom.",
      "They just need to get through those exams first.",

      "Speaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".",

      "He was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.",
      "Speaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.",
      "\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.",
      "\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"",
      "Surgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.",
      "He \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.",
      "Mr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.",
      "'Cricket saved him'",

      "\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"",
      "One of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.",
      "Flintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery.",
      "\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"",
      "The 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.",

    "story": [
      "A police watchdog has complained to Ofcom over an episode of Panorama about the shooting of Chris Kaba.",
      "The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) went to the broadcasting watchdog after its request for a public apology from the BBC went unmet, after the programme initially aired without including the IOPC's statement in response to claims made by its own former regional director Sal Naseem.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's own Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) ruling had judged the complaint to be \"resolved\" after it had been accepted as an oversight not to include the IOPC's point of view; the iPlayer version and online article were quickly amended.",
      "Mr Kaba was shot dead after he tried to ram his way out of a police vehicle stop in south London in September 2022.",
      "Sgt Martyn Blake, an officer in the specialist firearms unit MO19, was found not guilty of murder in October last year, prompting protests from the Kaba family.",
      "Speaking after the verdict at the Old Bailey, Mr Kaba's family said it was \"painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system\".",
      "Mr Naseem told BBC Panorama that in his opinion, he had not been convinced that Mr Kaba presented a sufficient danger to justify being shot.",
      "He suggested that the murder investigation into Mr Blake was launched amid pressure over potential unrest, which is denied by the IOPC.",
      "The IOPC complained that the programme did not make clear that Mr Naseem no longer works for the watchdog, and that it was not given the proper right to reply to the claims over why the investigation was launched.",
      "In the programme, Mr Naseem said that when the IOPC launched its homicide investigation four days after the shooting, \"It was fed back to us... that if we hadn't done it at that time then it's likely there would have been a level of disorder.\"",

      "The statement read: \"The decisions to criminally investigate Sergeant Blake, and then refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), followed careful consideration of a significant amount of evidence gathered during our independent investigation and by applying the relevant legal tests which govern our work.\"",
      "According to the BBC complaint unit's judgement, Panorama should have provided the IOPC with specific information about the claims to be made about it, and therefore found an element of unfairness to the IOPC.",
      "However it noted the programme makers had taken subsequent action to include the organisation's right to reply in the iPlayer version and related online article, which was deemed \"sufficient to resolve this aspect of the complaint.\"",
      "But the IOPC said on Thursday it had complained to Ofcom because it was \"hugely dissatisfied that, despite admitting these two breaches of its own guidelines, the BBC has steadfastly refused to apologise publicly despite the IOPC providing evidence to show the serious reputational damage caused to the organisation as a result of the programme.",
      "\"In particular, the suggestion within that programme, that the IOPC was pressured to start a homicide investigation, was wrong and resulted in public criticism from a number of media organisations and individuals including concerns raised by the London Assembly and local councillors about the IOPC's independence and motivations.",

    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",
      "\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\"",

      "The ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkelman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors.",
      "Highlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4.",
      "On 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time.",
      "Their concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the 2015 Charleston church shooting.",
      "Other stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo.",

      "\"I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practicing, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,\" she says.",
      "\"There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum.",
      "\"So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.\"",
      "Her programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose \"Alehouse sessions\" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.",
      "Lapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for \"messing around\" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the \"seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\".",
      "\"There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,\" she reveals. \"But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!\"",
      "This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson.",
      "\"I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,\" she says.",
      "\"Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.\"",
      "\"It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere.",
      "\"People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.\"",
      "Among the concerts to watch out for are:",

      "10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO.

      "7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. \"I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,\" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms.

      "The music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956.",
      "\"The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall,\" explains Dotan, \"and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms.",
      "\"It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season.\"",
      "For those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",

    "story": [
      "A magician who tricked her way into the Magic Circle is finally being granted membership - 34 years after she was kicked out.",
      "Sophie Lloyd says she disguised herself as a man to fool examiners into letting her join the elite society in 1991, at a time female magicians were not allowed to be members.",
      "When the Circle announced it was permitting women to join later that year, Ms Lloyd revealed her deception, prompting the society to expel her at the very same meeting it admitted its first female magicians.",
      "Following a public search to find her, the Circle has now apologised to Ms Lloyd and is presenting her with a membership certificate on Thursday evening.",
      "\"I'm beyond thrilled,\" Ms Lloyd told Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday.",
      "In the late 1980s, Ms Lloyd was studying at a school of mime in London where she befriended magician Jenny Winstanley.",
      "\"Jenny was increasingly frustrated that women, including herself, could not join the Magic Circle,\" Ms Lloyd said. \"So she came up with an idea to infiltrate the society by having me dress as a man. She couldn't do it herself as she was too recognisable.\"",
      "It was a colossal undertaking. Ms Lloyd had worked as Miss Winstanley's assistant at gigs but hadn't performed magic on her own, so had to learn.",
      "She invented a new identity - Raymond Lloyd - and spent about two years studying the character. She disguised herself with a wig, body suit and \"croaky\" voice. She wore gloves to hide her feminine hands.",
      "There was nothing she could do about her height - 5ft 2in (1.57m) - so instead she styled Raymond as a \"young-looking, 18-year-old,\" with some facial \"fluff\", she told Canadian broadcaster CBC in 1991.",
      "Ms Lloyd told the Today programme that her character was \"totally believed.\" She had no problems wearing the body suit, but the gloves made it \"very hard\" to do sleight of hand tricks, she said.",
      "By March 1991, Ms Lloyd was ready to have her skills put to the test. Rather than being scrutinised at the Magic Circle's headquarters - which Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley deemed too risky - Ms Lloyd opted to invite the society's examiners to a 20-minute performance at a working men's club in front of 200 spectators. To cover up her voice, Ms Lloyd said Raymond had laryngitis.",
      "Ms Lloyd even stayed for a drink with one of the examiners after the show.",
      "A week later, Ms Lloyd was told she had been granted membership to the Circle.",
      "For months, Raymond Lloyd performed magic and even socialised with other Magic Circle members.",
      "When Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley later heard the society was going to begin accepting female magicians as members, they decided to come clean about their deception and Miss Winstanley told the society about it over the phone.",
      "But the Magic Circle did not take kindly to the news. The duo got a letter saying that Raymond had been expelled, and in October 1991, at the first meeting accepting women into the society, Ms Lloyd was kicked out.",
      "\"We couldn't get our heads round it,\" Ms Lloyd said.",
      "Ms Lloyd spent about 10 years performing across the country as a magician, including performing anti-bullying shows, before she moved to Spain, where she took early retirement and has been involved in animal rescue work. Miss Winstanley went on to run a pottery firm in Norfolk, before she died in a car crash in 2004.",
      "The Magic Circle started a search for Ms Lloyd last year.",
      "\"I felt it important that the Magic Circle should be able to recognise Sophie as the role model for women magicians, as well as show that we are now a completely open society,\" said Laura London, the society's first female chair.",
      "Ms Lloyd only found out about the search for her when her sister sent her a link to an interview. Initially reluctant to join the society because of the amount of time that had passed, she eventually decided to do it to honour Miss Winstanley's legacy.",
      "Today, the Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated. The society has around 1,700 members, of which 5% are women.",
      "Ms Lloyd will receive her new membership certificate at an event at the Circle's London headquarters on Thursday evening, which will feature performances by five magicians and be attended by both members of the society and the general public. The society says Miss Winstanley will also be recognised at the event.",
      "\"This is for Jenny, really,\" Ms Lloyd said. \"I just think Jenny would have loved it.\"",

      "The streamer has announced it will split the new season in half - releasing the first episodes on 6 August and the second batch on 3 September.",
      "This series follows Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega, as she returns to Nevermore Academy, now under the leadership of new principal Barry Dort (Buscemi).",
      "Also joining the school this term is her little brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez), a character described by executive producer Tim Burton as an \"outcast among outcasts\".",
      "Wednesday's parents will also have an increased presence on campus this season - \"a rare new form of torture for the fiercely independent amateur sleuth\", Netflix said.",
      "The first full-length trailer, which was released, appropriately, on Wednesday, opened with the show's lead character going through airport security.",
      "As the metal detector beeps, she has to unload a knuckle duster, cattle prod, several knives and Thing - a disembodied hand - from her bag, before a security guard challenges her about the tube of sun cream she is also carrying.",
      "\"Wednesday Addams is one of the coolest characters of all time,\" Ortega said as the trailer launched.",
      "\"So to have gotten the opportunity to play her once was incredible, and then to be able to slip into the costume and tone again, it's so much fun.",
      "\"She runs circles around everyone that she has a conversation with, so to play someone who's so much more intelligent than you will ever be, it's quite funny and strange and enjoyable.\"",
      "Lumley 'perfect and hilarious'",
      "Veteran British actress Lumley has joined the cast as Hester Frump, Wednesday's grandmother and closest ally.",
      "\"The first day on set when Joanna walked on, she just was Hester and she nailed every single line, and it's just so delicious,\" said show creator Miles Millar. \"She's perfect and hilarious.\"",
      "Lumley described the Nevermore atmosphere as \"intoxicating\", adding: \"It's wonderful. I get to wear many, many huge wigs, one on top of the other - and lots of quite constraining clothes, so I love it.\"",
      "Buscemi's 'mysterious' principal",
      "Meanwhile, Buscemi described Principal Dort as \"a bit of a mysterious figure\", adding: \"Something about him is not right, but he loves the school and he has real outcast pride.\"",
      "The first series of Wednesday was Netflix's biggest hit to date, and cemented Ortega as a major screen star. She has since appeared in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Death of a Unicorn and Scream XI.",
      "In the trailer, Wednesday's mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) notes it's the first time her daughter has returned to school willingly.",
      "For her part, Wednesday describes returning to school as \"like returning to the scene of the crime\", noting that she \"already knows where the bodies are buried\".",
      "Later, the young Addams daughter is seen attending a macarbre tea party for a group of dolls.",
      "\"Wherever there's murder and mayhem,\" Wednesday reflects, \"you will always find an Addams.\"",
      "The trailer's reference to \"mayhem\" could hint at a previously reported cameo appearance from Lady Gaga, who recently released an album of that name.",
      "Netflix will be hoping the series replicates the success of the first. Its decision to split the new season in half is likely due to efforts to retain subscribers, refresh its platform and increase the hype around the show.",

    "summary": "New analysis of a letter suggests that the couple's relationship was closer than previously thought.",
    "story": [
      "The relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research.",
      "For more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her.",
      "However, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to \"good Mrs Shakespeare\", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610.",
      "The research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English.",
      "In the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead.",
      "Prof Steggle said: \"First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period.",
      "\"So, it's a story about the Shakespeares' marriage, really, as well as about Shakespeare's London contacts.",
      "\"And if the writing on the back of the letter is a reply, then it's also a story about the first ever bit of writing which can be attributed to Anne Hathaway.\"",
      "The letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion.",
      "The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area.",
      "\"It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,\" Prof Steggle said.",
      "\"Currently, there's only one known. It also shows a side of Shakespeare's London life that's not been known before, giving him a new address in Trinity Lane and a whole new sphere of activity for him.\"",
      "Prof Steggle said it \"opens the door\" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend \"significant\" time with her husband in London.",
      "\"It's not a complete slam dunk,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's a possibility that seems difficult to avoid, rather than a certainty.\"",
      "'They did love each other'",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery \"thrilling\" and \"wonderful\".",
      "\"There have been very respected scholars who've said that she was ugly, that Shakespeare hated her, that she trapped him into marriage, that she was illiterate, that she was stupid,\" Ms O'Farrell said.",
      "\"There is absolutely not one shred of evidence for any of that and it's always baffled me as to why she attracts all this vilification and all this misogyny.",
      "\"And it's so wonderful to find this tiny fragment of a letter which was discovered in the binding of a book that was published in 1608, that proves of course that they did love each other and probably lived together for some time in London.\"",

      "\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday.",
      "In his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model.",
      "The former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.",
      "Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.",
      "\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.",

      "Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".",
      "The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.",
      "Victims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said.",
      "During his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money.",
      "\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\"",
      "Mr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters.",
      "Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.",
      "Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.",
      "He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.",
      "Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit.",
      "A judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court.",
      "His lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed.",
      "In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.",
      "He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence.",
      "The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.",
      "Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".",
      "Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.",
      "Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.",
      "His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.",
      "The former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020."

      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",

      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",

      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",

      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",

      "But Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.",
      "\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.",
      "\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"",

      "In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.",
      "The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.",

      "Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.",
      "Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.",
      "\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.",
      "She added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.",
      "\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"",
      "As her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.",
      "There was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.",
      "Knowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.",
      "But when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.",

      "As for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business\".",
      "At just 13, Blue Ivy has already made strides in her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.",
      "But Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".",

    "story": [
      "Last year, Alfie Watts went global, becoming the youngest ever winner of Race Across the World - the BBC show that does exactly what it says on the tin.",
      "Teams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget.",
      "After 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.",
      "The series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and \u00a320,000 prize pot.",
      "It also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and online content creator.",
      "As series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.",
      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling \"further afield\".",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",
      "Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.",
      "Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.",
      "And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.",
      "Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.",
      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\", responsibly.",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",
      "He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.",
      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",
      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled (and able to offer visa guidance to his followers), the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways; acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK - a mental health charity for young people - and Winston's Wish - a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",
      "Speaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].",
      "\"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"",
      "Race Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.",
      "They include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.",
      "The rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.",
      "Watts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and a \"topsy-turvy\" series.",
      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",
      "He also suggests hacks like packing \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.",
      "\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.",
      "\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"",
      "Is he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?",
      "He replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.",
      "\"I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.\"",
      "Series five of Race Across the World begins on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.",

    "story": [
      "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.",
      "If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.",
      "But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.",
      "Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.",
      "Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).",
      "Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.",
      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.",
      "By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",
      "\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.",
      "But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".",
      "She is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.",
      "\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.",

      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",
      "\"It's a wonderful feeling,\" Chris says. \"I'm no longer afraid of dying.\"",

    "summary": "NHS safety body wants a focus on staff fatigue as it warns of mistakes and impaired decision-making.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.",
      "The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals.",
      "It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents.",
      "In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.",
      "In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed.",
      "In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures.",
      "The hospital investigation found fatigue was \"likely to have been a factor\".",
      "Sleep-deprived",
      "Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis.",
      "And one doctor told the watchdog: \"When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?\"",
      "The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.",
      "Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue.",
      "The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue.",
      "It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.",
      "Support available",
      "Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: \"Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.",
      "\"We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.\"",
      "Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite.",
      "She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.",
      "But she said fatigue was also \"often driven by workforce shortages\" too.",
      "A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was \"committed\" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care.",
      "\"Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,\" he added.",
      "He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.",

      "\"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\"",
      "Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media.",
      "Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.",
      "Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.",
      "While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing.",
      "For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.",

      "Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of \"facial imperfections\" - have been surging in popularity.",
      "After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation.",
      "These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal.",
      "As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched.",
      "Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's \"magic mirror\" feature, the app still points out \"imperfections\" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries.",
      "\"It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I've done that.\"",
      "Abby seems amused.",
      "\"Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?\"",
      "Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice.",
      "'My skin felt like there was cement underneath'",
      "To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China.",
      "But there's a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence.",
      "According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications.",
      "As a result, it's estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics.",
      "Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing.",
      "\"I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,\" Dr Yang says.",
      "\"Some even had surgery inside people's homes.\"",
      "Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong.",
      "In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened.",
      "\"My skin felt like there was cement underneath,\" she says.",
      "Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse.",
      "One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose.",
      "Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight.",
      "\"My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it's affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too.\"",
      "She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic.",
      "But while Dr Yang's surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent.",

      "However, weeks before She's Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address.",
      "BBC Eye has found strong links between She's Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He.",
      "The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021.",
      "Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches.",

      "One receptionist role asks for candidates to be \"at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing\", while an administrative job demands \"an appealing look and an elegant presence\".",
      "And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers.",
      "Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a \"beauty consultant\" job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024.",
      "After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening.",
      "But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job.",
      "Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide.",
      "Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (\u00a31,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest.",
      "She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called \"beauty loan,\" falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved.",

      "Outside of the UK, you can watch the documentary on YouTube.",
      "The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her.",
      "She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real.",
      "\"They wanted me to leave from the beginning,\" she says.",
      "Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months.",
      "BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China's \"capital of cosmetic surgery\". Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years.",
      "The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role.",
      "This scam isn't limited to clinic jobs - it's creeping into other industries.",
      "Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame.",

      "More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized by Trading Standards officers across England in the past three years, new analysis by the BBC has found. We joined one of the teams responsible for tracking down the illicit goods as they prepare for a ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes.",
      "Paul Leighton is packing his rucksack with a heavy-duty hammer, pry bar and evidence bags for what he describes as \"just an average day out\".",
      "As the senior Trading Standards officer at Newcastle City Council, he has learned the hiding places used to conceal illegal vapes can be sophisticated. Sometimes, he has to force his way in.",
      "He has found them hidden everywhere from inside fridges and barbecues to behind fake fuse boxes and tiled panels complete with hydraulic lifts.",
      "\"I've seen entire kitchens come away from walls and off the floor as well\u2026 so all sorts of hiding places,\" he says.",
      "Classified as illicit or non-compliant vapes, the products he will be searching for today fail to meet the legal requirements for sale in the UK.",
      "More than six million of them were seized in England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC.",
      "The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops.",
      "If you get a normal vape, he says, \"they've got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes\".",
      "But if you get an illegal one, \"it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that'll have on someone's lungs.\"",
      "According to Trading Standards, illicit or non-compliant vapes can be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings.",
      "The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown.",
      "On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter.",
      "\"It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it's just a case of where they're hiding the rest,\" says Paul.",
      "We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes.",
      "Paul's hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes.",
      "How widespread are illegal vapes?",
      "Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024:",
      "At least 6,169,822 illicit or non-compliant vaping products were seized, including those taken at ports as well as in shopsThere were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than onceRetailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",

      "There were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than once",
      "Retailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",
      "Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once.",
      "The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular 'cash market', that we've seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes.\"",
      "They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said it was allocating an extra \u00a310m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded.",
      "Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation.",
      "\"These are quite sophisticated networks that we're up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,\" says Paul.",
      "\"I think we'll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven't really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time.",
      "\"They've always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here.\"",
      "When does the disposable vapes ban start?",
      "From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale.",
      "Those caught doing so will get a \u00a3200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences.",
      "The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement.",
      "Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting \"not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced\" and \"some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to\".",

      "The hospital where she was born - Glenfield Hospital in Leicester - says it knows of no other case in the UK where the baby has survived.",
      "Now seven years old, Vanellope has undergone groundbreaking surgery to reconstruct a protective cage around her heart - using her ribs.",
      "The BBC was given exclusive access into theatre, when the operation took place at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, based at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, last Wednesday.",
      "Warning: This story contains an image of surgery",
      "It's early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place.",
      "Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin.",
      "Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest.",
      "Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope's birth on 22 November.",
      "Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before.",
      "\"I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,\" he says. \"But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life.\"",
      "He remembers how \"everything was unknown\" when Vanellope was born, because no-one in the country had ever dealt with a similar case.",
      "A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition.",
      "Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival.",
      "But she defied those odds and was allowed home after 14 months in hospital.",
      "Since then, Vanellope has had to wear a brace around her chest to protect her heart.",
      "She has complex medical needs, which require one-to-one care, 24 hours a day. She is autistic and non-verbal.",
      "Mum Naomi Findlay, 39, who lives in Clifton, Nottingham, described her daughter as \"a happy little thing\" who \"brings a lot of joy and a lot of happiness\".",

      "The team waiting in theatre include specialists from the Congenital Heart Centre, Leicester Children's Hospital and a visiting cardiothoracic surgeon from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.",
      "Consultant congenital cardiac surgeon, Ikenna Omeje, operated on Vanellope just 50 minutes after she was born.",
      "He recalls there being a lot of \"head scratching\" among surgeons, because the condition was so rare.",
      "\"It was exciting for everyone because it was something we had never seen before. So you made the news, not just within the UK, but all over the world,\" he says.",
      "Explaining the current procedure, he points to a 3D scan of Vanellope's chest, and describes how her heart has attached to the thin layer of skin protecting it.",
      "Detaching it \"is risky\", he confesses.",
      "\"You can damage the vessel trying to get into the chest cavity,\" he said.",
      "Now aged seven, surgeons decided Vanellope had reached the right age for reconstructive surgery to form a permanent structure around her heart.",
      "Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs.",
      "This allows her heart to deflate, allowing the \"very tricky\" procedure to detach part of her heart - the right ventricular outflow tract - and the pulmonary artery from where it has stuck to her skin.",
      "Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope's ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart.",
      "Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says.",
      "The extremely complex procedure lasts more than nine hours. And it's a success. The surgeons are delighted.",
      "Mr Omeje is beaming as he says it \"went a lot better than we expected\".",
      "He describes how he examined an X-ray of Vanellope's chest after the operation, and called it \"really beautiful\".",
      "Mr Omeje called Vanellope \"one of a kind\" and explained how fulfilling it was to have everything go so well.",
      "\"The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mum to say 'thank you, you guys are amazing',\" he says.",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:51:21 GMT",
    "summary": "The judgement provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean, but it remains to be seen what will change.",
    "story": [
      "\"A victory for common sense\" or \"devastating\" \u2013\u202f the contrasting reactions to the statement by five Supreme Court judges that legally the term \"woman\" means a biological woman.",
      "Behind the different responses lie many of the often bitter and vitriolic arguments that set the country on a long, tricky road towards Wednesday's unambiguous judgement.",
      "When the highest court in the land ruled that sex is binary - meaning legally it should be interpreted as referring to either a biological man or a biological woman - it was providing clarity that had been missing from such conversations for years.",
      "Words like \"woman\"\u202fand \"sex\"\u202fhad become loaded with different meanings depending on your viewpoint. Language that for centuries had been uncomplicated and accepted, became a battleground.",
      "The judgement is intended to draw a line under that.",
      "It argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman. That does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender.",
      "This means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them. That includes changing rooms, toilets, women's refuges, single-sex hospital wards and anywhere designated as for one sex only.",
      "How much change that will mean in practice will be set out in detailed guidance. Until then, there remain lots of questions and some confusion - and that is challenging in an area where views are so polarised.",
      "From jubilance to devastation",
      "It was Baroness Falkner, the woman who heads the watchdog that regulates equality laws, who described the judgement as a victory for common sense.",
      "She added it was only such a victory if you recognised trans people, \"that they exist, they have rights, and their rights must be respected\".",
      "She also told the BBC about the abuse she had faced since taking over as chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)\u202fin 2020.",
      "She had previously told the Times that women had the right to question gender identity, and that had led to some very personal abuse from those who disagreed with her.",
      "\"I had not realised how difficult the job would be,\" she said. \"It\u202fhas taken a toll, but if you are in public life you have to take that.\"",
      "The second response to the judgement was from the trans rights campaign group TransActual, which described the Supreme Court judgement as devastating.",
      "One of its activists, Jane Fae, told the BBC the judgement felt like a physical body blow, and that it was as if trans people were being excluded from society.",
      "\"Today we're feeling very alone\" she said. \"What does this mean - can I use this loo, can I do that, can I do the other?\"",
      "In contrast, the women's groups who fought the case feel vindicated and jubilant.",
      "Helen Joyce, the director of advocacy at the campaign group Sex Matters, says the ruling is \"incredibly\u202fimportant for the half of humanity who need single-sex spaces\".",
      "Women's groups argue that the ruling is important for reasons of privacy, safety, dignity and discrimination.",
      "The Supreme Court case was brought by a group called For Women Scotland. It wanted to overturn Scottish legislation which said 50% of members on public boards should be women - and trans women were included in their definition.",
      "The group lost its case in Scotland's highest court but appealed to the UK Supreme Court. The case was heard towards the end of last year.",
      "\"What we wanted was clarity in the law - when something is described as a single-sex service, a single-sex space, that this relates to biology,\" Susan Smith from For Women Scotland told the BBC.",
      "Beginnings of the culture wars",
      "Over time the arguments over how a woman is defined had become increasingly angry, bitter and divided, because the stakes were high for all involved.",
      "For transgender people, who say they often face victimisation and harassment, the battles were rooted in attempts to win better legal protection.",
      "\"Legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life,\" according to Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK. \u202fThe charity opposed For Women Scotland's case in the Supreme Court.",
      "The question of how to achieve legal recognition rose to prominence in 2002 when two judgements at the European Court of Human Rights found the UK was breaching human rights by failing to legally recognise transgender people in their acquired gender.",
      "This eventually led to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, which allowed a trans person to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).\u202fThis recognised their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, allowing official documents like birth certificates to be changed to reflect that.",
      "But\u202fit was a long-winded process requiring two doctors to sign it off and for the person to \"live\u202fin their acquired gender\" for at least two years. Only about 8,000 people have applied for a GRC since they came into being, according to government figures.",
      "Campaigners began calling for the process to be simplified. In a response to a 2020 government consultation on amending the GRA, Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, called for a \"move\u202fto a de-medicalised and straightforward legal gender recognition process\".",
      "Gradually these calls gained momentum.",
      "In 2022, the Scottish government introduced a law that would allow people to \"self-identify\"\u202fin their desired gender. This was later blocked by the UK government and eventually dropped as a Scottish policy.",
      "As the rights of trans people were being debated, women's groups started pushing back about what that meant for biological women.",
      "The meaning of words like \"woman\"\u202fand \"sex\"\u202ftook on new significance, if someone who was biologically male had a certificate that identified them as a woman for legal purposes.",
      "Under the 2010 Equality Act, sex was a protected characteristic, and so was gender reassignment. With the very meaning of those categories in dispute, legal experts said it set the protections of one group against the protections of another.",
      "The complexities mean courts and tribunals have frequently been called on to arbitrate.",
      "And social media has often provided a starting point for angry disputes, connecting and amplifying voices, and in many cases, leading to more entrenched viewpoints.  It had become a culture war.",
      "How the debate began to change",
      "In 2019, tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job because she tweeted that she did not believe people could change their sex. She said biological sex was immutable and not the same as gender identity.",
      "As a result, her work contract was not renewed. Her employer said it wanted to build an inclusive workplace.",
      "She lost her case at an employment tribunal case, but an Appeal Court judge later ruled that gender critical beliefs were protected by the Equalities Act. In 2023, she was awarded \u00a3100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal.",
      "It was a high-profile battle through tribunals and courts which put employers' policies on inclusion under the spotlight and raised questions about whether by protecting the rights of one group, another was being discriminated against.",
      "Ms Forstater went on to set up the campaign group Sex Matters, and\u202fwas among those celebrating outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday.",
      "There have been other similar cases brought against employers since then. Sex Matters lists 11 settled or ongoing cases on its website.",
      "But other high-profile cases have also shaped the broader debate.",
      "In March 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell took legal action against the only children's NHS gender clinic, saying she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male whilst a teenager.",
      "Although she eventually lost her case, it started a chain reaction, which led to a shake-up of gender services for children and young people.",
      "And in 2021 the Sussex University professor, Kathleen Stock, quit her job after being accused of having transphobic views. She had published a book that questioned whether gender identity was more significant than biological sex.",
      "She denied being transphobic but was subjected to a student campaign to remove her from her post.\u202fThe university was later fined for failing to uphold freedom of speech.",
      "These and other cases put an uncomfortable spotlight on a debate that many preferred to ignore or dismiss as mainly happening on social media, because it was too tricky and using the wrong language could lead to abuse.",
      "Yet fundamental questions were being raised about freedom of speech, how we treat each other and how you define a woman. The need for clarity had become overwhelming.",
      "In terms of equality law, the Supreme Court ruling provided that.",
      "For women's groups there is sheer relief that biological facts will now drive decisions.",
      "But for many trans people there is distress. Even though they still have protections under the Equality Act, for many it does not feel like that.  They worry that harassment will increase.",
      "Activist\u202fCharlie Craggs,\u202fwho is a trans woman,\u202ftold the BBC it was\u202freally sad that this tiny community of less than 1% of the population was being \"thrown under the bus\".",
      "Supreme Court ruling in practice",
      "Crucially, the ruling provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean. The EHRC says it is \"working\u202fat pace\" to update its guidance, and expects that to be ready by the summer.",
      "It has already made it clear that if a single-sex space, like a toilet or changing room, is women-only, that means biological males who identify as women should not use it.",
      "It says instead that trans people should use their \"powers\u202fof advocacy\" to campaign for third spaces, such as unisex toilets.",
      "And it has said it will pursue the NHS if it does not follow the latest ruling.",
      "Health service guidance on single-sex wards currently says that \"trans people\u202fshould be accommodated according to their presentation, the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use\".",
      "Currently this allows trans women to be offered beds on women-only wards.",
      "The NHS says its policy is under review.",
      "Former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption says that while the ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women only facilities, they are not necessarily obliged to do so.",
      "He told Radio 4's PM programme that in sport, for example, it would be down to individual governing bodies to decide who is allowed to compete in women's sport.",
      "\"They could decide to allow trans women to compete on the same basis as biological women, some sporting authorities do, although I think that in light of the latest judgement, they would be wise to say so expressly in their rules,\" he said.",
      "British Transport Police has been the first body to actually change its policies. It says strip searches of people in custody will be carried out by officers of the same biological sex",
      "It means a trans woman would be searched by a male officer, and a police officer who is a trans woman would not be able to search a biological woman.",
      "The domestic violence charity Refuge says the ruling will not change the way it operates.",
      "Its chief executive, Gemma Sherrington, says, \"we remain firmly committed to supporting all survivors of domestic abuse, including trans women\".",
      "But for many businesses, sports clubs and other organisations it is too soon to know what this will mean in practice.",
      "They will need to see the detailed guidance from the Equality Commission first. Until then it is difficult to know how much change, if any, they will need to make or what new issues might arise.",
      "Some organisations will also have to decide whether they have the space and money to provide so-called third spaces or unisex facilities",
      "For trans people there is also a lot of uncertainty. They will have been used to using spaces which correspond to their gender identity - changing that may be difficult and, for some, frightening.",

    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",

      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland than households in the South.",

      "One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.",
      "Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.",
      "The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.",

      "Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".",
      "But she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".",

      "Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".",
      "He said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.",

      "On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".",
      "However, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"",

      "\"That will never be my approach.\"",
      "Last year, Sir Keir and Sunak rowed over a transgender comment the latter made on the day Esther Ghey - the mother of murdered transgender teenage Brianna - was visiting Parliament.",
      "During PMQs, Sir Keir sought to attack Badenoch's record, accusing her of doing \"nothing\" when she was women and equalities minister.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkep1vx3mro",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:15:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to reduce energy bills by using more renewables, but bills are currently rising.",
    "story": [
      "Energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family in April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.",
      "But Labour pledged in its manifesto: \"We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.\" It also promised bills would come down by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\".",
      "Responding to the 6% price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to \"our reliance on the fossil fuel markets\" and added: \"We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.\"",
      "The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.",
      "More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?",
      "There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.",
      "People should consider energy bill fix, regulator says",
      "Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?",
      "How do UK prices compare with other countries?",
      "The UK's electricity is expensive.",
      "Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.",
      "This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.",
      "For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.",
      "The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.",
      "The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.",
      "Other parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.",
      "The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.",
      "How is the price set?",
      "The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.",
      "Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.",
      "Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions.",
      "The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.",
      "In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.",
      "\"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.",
      "How cheap is renewable energy?",
      "Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.",
      "But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.",
      "The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity. To get developers to deliver this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.",
      "It does that by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity generated for 15 years into the future.",
      "If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company. If the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.",
      "Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.",
      "Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.",
      "As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.",
      "\"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.",
      "\"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"",
      "What about extra costs?",
      "The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.",
      "This adds to the network costs in a bill.",
      "Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.",
      "Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.",
      "Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.",
      "What is being done?",
      "The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear.",
      "In the long term, renewables \"will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,\" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.",
      "But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly.",
      "Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive \"strike prices\", locking in higher costs.",
      "\"If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further\u2026 but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],\" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.",
      "\"That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.\"",
      "But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.",
      "The government said earlier in February that its plans would \"bring down bills for households and businesses for good\" and lowering them by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" remains an objective.",

      "In March 2022, when he was leader of the opposition, Sir Keir told the Times that \"a woman is a female adult, and in addition to that transwomen are women, and that is not just my view - that is actually the law\".",

      "Pressed over when the PM had changed his mind earlier, his spokesman insisted the Labour government had been consistent that single-sex spaces \"are protected in law\".",

      "Later that year he told BBC Radio 5 Live \"a woman is an adult female\".",
      "And in April 2024 he said Rosie Duffield, who quit the party last year, was right to say \"only women have a cervix\", telling ITV: \"Biologically, she of course is right about that.\"",
      "Sir Keir had previously been critical of Duffield's views on trans people when she was a Labour MP, saying in 2021 that she was \"not right\" to say only women have a cervix.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir would now use a trans woman's preferred pronouns, the spokesman declined to comment on \"hypotheticals\" but insisted the PM had \"been clear that trans women should be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else\".",
      "Earlier on Tuesday Sir Keir welcomed the court's decision, saying it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance.",
      "In his first public comments since the ruling last week, the PM told ITV West Country: \"We need to move and make sure that we now ensure that all guidance is in the right place according to that judgment.\"",
      "Asked if he does not believe a transwoman is a woman, he said: \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\"",
      "During a Commons debate on the ruling on Monday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson welcomed the \"added clarity\" of the ruling and said the government would work to \"protect single-sex spaces based on biological sex\".",

      "\"I know what a woman is and I always have,\" she said. \"The people of this country know what a woman is.",
      "\"We didn't need the Supreme Court to tell us that - but this government did.\"",
      "Badenoch added: \"The idea that they have supported this all along is for the birds... They have never said this before, this is a U-turn, but we welcome it.\"",
      "Earlier, Phillipson was pressed over whether a trans woman should use a women's toilet or a men's toilet.",
      "\"That should be on the basis of biological sex - that would apply right across the board to all single-sex provision,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"But the EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] will be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate and respect their privacy and dignity.\"",
      "Phillipson added that \"many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate cubicles that can be used by anyone\".",
      "Asked whether there was unity in the Labour Party about this issue, she replied: \"I speak for the government on this matter and I can be crystal clear with you that we welcome the ruling.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs will be uneasy about the comments from Sir Keir and Phillipson, although frustration did not seem to extend to being willing to criticise the government, but instead expressing concern about anxieties within the trans, non-binary and intersex community.",
      "In the debate following Phillipson's statement, Labour's Emily Thornberry said LGBT helpline calls had \"skyrocketed in recent days\" and highlighted that \"the overwhelming threat to women and to all of the trans community is the violence that we suffer from cis men\".",
      "Nadia Whittome pointed out that a ban on trans women using women's toilets, or trans men using men's toilets, would leave them using facilities they \"would not feel comfortable or safe in\".",
      "Liberal Democrat women and equalities spokeswoman Christine Jardine warned the ruling threatened the human rights and security \"of another vulnerable group in society\" and questioned where trans people should now seek refuge.",
      "Women and Equalities select committee chair, Labour's Sarah Owen, said the judges made their decision \"without a single contribution from trans people\" and won a commitment from Phillipson that trans \"stakeholders\" would be involved in the creation of upcoming guidance.",
      "Some MPs who have campaigned in support of trans rights pointed to commitments in Labour's general election manifesto to introduce a \"trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices\" as well as to \"modernise, simplify, and reform\" gender recognition law.",

      "Cooper set out the government's plans for further policing reforms in the House of Commons in November last year.",
      "She said the plans would involve strengthening requirements relating to the suspension of officers under investigation for violence against women and girls, and ensuring that officers convicted of certain criminal offences are automatically dismissed.",

      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",

    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to \"reduce the administrative burden\" on the Environment Agency (EA).",
      "In 2023, the BBC reported that EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.",
      "The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system, calling it the equivalent of companies \"mark[ing] their own homework\".",
      "But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.",
      "\"Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,\" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.",
      "It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.",

      "Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.",
      "The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.",
      "Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.",
      "Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats.",
      "\"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said.",
      "\"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\"",
      "Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.",
      "Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.",
      "\"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\"",
      "As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.",
      "\"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News.",
      "The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.",
      "The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\"",
      "The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.",
      "Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.",
      "Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\".",
      "Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".",
      "His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.",
      "Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\"",
      "The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.",
      "Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.",
      "The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.",
      "David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\""

    "story": [
      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",

      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",

      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",
      "She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.",
      "In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.",
      "She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.",
      "\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",
      "'Some impact on environment'",
      "There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.",
      "Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.",
      "\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"",
      "Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.",

      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.",
      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.",
      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",
      "\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.",
      "\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.",
      "He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.",
      "Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.",
      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",
      "\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"",
      "That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.",
      "A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.",
      "In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.",
      "He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.",
      "The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  \u00a34.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.",
      "And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.",
      "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\".",
      "\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.",
      "Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.",
      "As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.",

    "summary": "Skeletons and artefacts unearthed from the site near Cardiff Airport are baffling archaeologists.",
    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",

    "summary": "While Meta says the AI chatbot is a \"good thing\", some users have shared their frustrations.",
    "story": [
      "WhatsApp says its new AI feature embedded in the messaging service is \"entirely optional\" - despite the fact it cannot be removed from the app.",
      "The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen.",
      "Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app.",
      "It follows Microsoft's Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash and decided to allow people to disable it.",
      "\"We think giving people these options is a good thing and we're always listening to feedback from our users,\" WhatsApp told the BBC.",
      "The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like 'channels' and 'status'.",
      "It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram.",
      "The firm revealed it was testing AI technology in the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform.",
      "Where is the new blue circle?",
      "If you can't see it, you may not be able to use it yet.",
      "Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it \"might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access\".",
      "As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to 'Ask Meta AI or Search'.",
      "This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta.",
      "Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta.",
      "Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is \"optional\".",
      "On its website, WhatsApp says Meta AI \"can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas\".",
      "I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity.",
      "It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems.",
      "One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London.",
      "What do people think of it?",
      "So far in Europe people aren't very pleased, with users on X, Bluesky, and Reddit outlining their frustrations - and Guardian columnist Polly Hudson was among those venting their anger at not being able to turn it off.",
      "Dr Kris Shrishak, an adviser on AI and privacy, was also highly critical, and accused Meta of \"exploiting its existing market\" and \"using people as test subjects for AI\".",
      "\"No one should be forced to use AI,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Its AI models are a privacy violation by design - Meta, through web scraping, has used personal data of people and pirated books in training them.",
      "\"Now that the legality of their approach has been challenged in courts, Meta is looking for other sources to collect data from people, and this feature could be one such source.\"",
      "An investigation by The Atlantic revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its Llama AI.",
      "Author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene, and Meta is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on The Atlantic investigation.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "When you first use Meta AI in WhatsApp, it states the chatbot \"can only read messages people share with it\".",
      "\"Meta can't read any other messages in your personal chats, as your personal messages remain end to end encrypted,\" it says.",
      "Meanwhile the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it would \"continue to monitor the adoption of Meta AI's technology and use of personal data within WhatsApp\".",
      "\"Personal information fuels much of AI innovation so people need to trust that organisations are using their information responsibly,\" it said.",
      "\"Organisations who want to use people's personal details to train or use generative AI models need to comply with all their data protection obligations, and take the necessary extra steps when it comes to processing the data of children.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Dr Shrishak says users should be wary.",
      "\"When you send messages to your friend, end to end encryption will not be affected,\" he said.",
      "\"Every time you use this feature and communicate with Meta AI, you need to remember that one of the ends is Meta, not your friend.\"",
      "The tech giant also highlights that you should only share material which you know could be used by others.",
      "\"Don't share information, including sensitive topics, about others or yourself that you don't want the AI to retain and use,\" it says.",

    "summary": "The tech giants have reacted with fury, accusing the EU of unfairly pursuing US companies.",
    "story": [
      "The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined \u20ac700m (\u00a3599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.",
      "It has issued a \u20ac500m (\u00a3428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.",
      "\"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.",
      "The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\"",
      "The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.",
      "The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America.",
      "EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\"",
      "The White House has been contacted for comment.",
      "Data and apps",
      "The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).",
      "The case against Apple was over its App Store.",
      "The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.",
      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.",
      "Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.",
      "The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.",
      "In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says \"allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.\"",
      "The Commission is currently assessing the new option.",
      "In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\".",
      "Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.",
      "\"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.",
      "\"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"",
      "Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\"",
      "It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.",
      "Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.",
      "\"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Epic dispute",
      "The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.",
      "But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.",
      "In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.",
      "\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.",
      "Prof Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.",
      "They are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.",
      "One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.",
      "They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.",
      "Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" in a thread on X.",
      "He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.",
      "A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.",
      "The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\"",
      "\"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said.",
      "The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.",
      "\"Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and Google's general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,\" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",

      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",
      "But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.",

      "But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.",

      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",

      "The feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.",
      "After Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picass\u00f3 Piquer saying she chose to take part \"for fun, but also as a statement\".",

      "He contributed his starter\u00a0pack because \"like many artists who use their real hands\", he was \"tired\" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.",

      "\"People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,\" he said.",
      "Eli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as \"carefree and fun\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,\" he said. \"Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.\"",
      "And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.",
      "\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.",
      "\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"",
      "Pot Noodles in the Large Hadron Collider",
      "Back in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,\" he said.",
      "\"I think all of us have experimented with it.\"",
      "And Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.",
      "\"It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:42:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",
    "story": [
      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",
      "The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.",
      "In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.",
      "Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.",
      "During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.",
      "How will the export controls impact US-China competition?",
      "The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.",
      "Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.",
      "And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.",
      "Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.",

    "summary": "India will respond but it's not clear how - or at what cost, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Tuesday's bloodshed in Pahalgam - where at least 26 tourists were killed in a hail of gunfire - marks the deadliest militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir since 2019.",
      "The victims weren't soldiers or officials, but civilians on holiday in one of India's most picturesque valleys. That alone makes this strike both brutal and symbolic: a calculated assault not just on lives, but on a fragile sense of normalcy the Indian state has worked hard to project in the disputed region.",
      "Given the fraught history of Kashmir - claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but ruled by each only in part - India's response is likely to be shaped as much by precedent as by pressure, say experts.",
      "For starters, Delhi has swiftly taken a series of retaliatory steps: closing the main border crossing, suspending a critical water-sharing treaty, and expelling diplomats.",
      "More significantly, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has vowed a \"strong response,\" pledging action not just against the perpetrators but also the masterminds behind the \"nefarious acts\" on Indian soil.",
      "The question, analysts say, is not whether there will be a military response - but when, and how calibrated it will be, and at what cost.",
      "\"We are likely to see a strong response \u2013 one that signals resolve to both domestic audiences and actors in Pakistan. Since 2016 and especially after 2019, the threshold for retaliation has been set at cross-border or air strikes,\" military historian Srinath Raghavan told the BBC.",
      "\"It'll be hard for the government to act below that now. Pakistan will likely respond, as it did before. The risk, as always, is miscalculation \u2013 on both sides.\"",
      "Mr Raghavan is alluding to two previous major retaliations by India in 2016 and 2019.",
      "After the deadly Uri attack in September 2016, where 19 Indian soldiers were killed, India launched what it called \"surgical strikes\" across the de facto border - also known as the Line of Control (LoC) - targeting what it said were militant launch pads in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "And in 2019, after at least 40 paramilitary personnel were killed in Pulwama, India hit an alleged militant camp in Balakot with airstrikes - its first such strike deep inside Pakistan since 1971. Pakistan responded with air raids, leading to a dogfight and the brief capture of an Indian pilot. Both sides showed strength but avoided full-scale war.",
      "Two years later, in 2021, they agreed to an LoC ceasefire, which has largely held - despite recurring militant attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, believes that the combination of high fatality levels and the targeting of Indian civilians in the latest attack \"suggests a strong possibility of an Indian military response against Pakistan, if Delhi determines or merely assumes any level of Pakistani complicity\".",
      "\"The chief advantage  of such a reaction for India would be political, as there will be strong public pressure for India to respond forcefully, \" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Another advantage, if a retaliation successfully takes out terrorist targets, would be restoring deterrence and degrading an anti-India threat. The disadvantage is that a retaliation would risk a serious crisis and even conflict.\"",
      "What are India's options?",
      "Covert action offers deniability but may not satisfy the political need to visibly restore deterrence, says Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US.",
      "That leaves India with two possible paths, he notes.",
      "First, the 2021 LoC ceasefire has been fraying, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could greenlight a return to cross-border firing.",
      "Second, airstrikes or even conventional cruise missile strikes, like in 2019, are also on the table - each carrying the risk of a retaliatory spiral, as seen in the air skirmishes that followed then.",
      "\"No path is without risks. The US is also distracted and may not be willing or be able to assist with crisis management,\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia,  told the BBC.",
      "One of the gravest risks in any India-Pakistan crisis is that both sides are nuclear-armed. That fact casts a long shadow over every decision, shaping not just military strategy but political calculations.",
      "\"Nuclear weapons are both a danger and a restraint - they force decision-makers on both sides to act with caution. Any response is likely to be presented as precise and targeted. Pakistan may retaliate in kind, then look for an off-ramp, says Mr Raghavan.",
      "\"We've seen this pattern in other conflicts too, like Israel-Iran - calibrated strikes, followed by efforts to de-escalate. But the risk is always that things won't go according to script.\"",
      "Mr Kugelman says that one of the lessons of the Pulwama crisis is that \"each country is comfortable using limited counter retaliation\".",
      "\"India will need to weigh the political and tactical advantages of retaliation with the risk of a serious crisis or conflict.\"",
      "Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US, believes escalation is possible this time, with India likely to consider limited \"surgical strikes\" like in 2016.",
      "\"The advantage of such strikes from India's point of view is they are limited in scope, so Pakistan does not have to respond, and yet they demonstrate to the Indian public that India has acted,\" Mr Haqqani, a senior fellow at Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy and Hudson Institute, told the BBC.",
      "\"But such strikes can also invite retaliation from Pakistan, which argues that it is being blamed in a knee jerk reaction, without any investigation or evidence.\"",
      "Whatever course India chooses - and however Pakistan responds -  each step is fraught with risk. The threat of escalation looms, and with it, the fragile peace in Indian-administered Kashmir slips further out of reach.",
      "At the same time, India must reckon with the security failures that allowed the attack to happen in the first place. \"That such an attack occurred at the peak of tourist season,\" Mr Raghavan noted, \"points to a serious lapse - especially in a Union Territory where the federal government directly controls law and order.\""

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has ended an historic visit to South Africa, signalling a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations.",
      "The visit marked a diplomatic breakthrough for the Ukrainian leader in his efforts to counter Russia's strong - and growing - influence in Africa.",
      "\"I'm sure that Russia will be annoyed by the visit, but I don't think it can do much about it,\" said Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Relations think-tank.",
      "But Russia disrupted Zelensky's visit by carrying out an air strike on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, forcing him to announce that he will cut short the trip by returning home immediately after meeting President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "The South African leader said the visit had \"reaffirmed\" the bonds between the two nations, pointing out that Zelensky's visit was the first in 33 years by a Ukrainian head of state.",
      "Apart from a brief stopover in Cape Verde in 2023 while flying to Argentina, this was also Zelensky's first visit to Africa since he became Ukraine's president in 2019.",
      "Ukraine grasped the diplomatic significance of African states, when many of them - including regional powerhouse South Africa - refused to condemn Russia's full-scale invasion of its territory in 2022.",
      "\"Ukraine neglected the continent in terms of foreign policy, but it has changed that over the last three years, doubling its embassies from 10 to 20,\" Mr Gruzd told the BBC.",
      "\"But it's in a very crowded space - Russia, China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates are all trying to increase their influence in Africa.\"",
      "Zelensky's visit to South Africa at this point was especially significant, as Ukraine's relationship with the US - its main weapons supplier - has soured since President Donald Trump took office in January.",
      "He briefly paused military aid, denounced Zelenksy as a \"dictator\", and has accused Ukraine of being responsible for the war.",
      "\"Ukraine needs every bit of legitimacy it can get internationally - not just in Europe.   Wars aren't only won in the battlefield, but also in courts of public opinion around the world,\" said Prof Siphamandla Zondi, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg.",
      "For South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, the visit was equally significant, as his country, too, was under intense pressure from the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US has turned diplomacy on its head,\" Mr Gudz said, adding: \"Everyone is looking for new friends.\"",
      "Ramaphosa saw Zelensky's visit as an attempt to boost his credentials as a peacemaker, saying their talks focused on efforts to reach a \"comprehensive peace\".",
      "The South African leader also held a phone conversation with Putin ahead of Zelensky's visit.",
      "\"We both affirmed the strong bilateral relations between our respective countries,\" Ramaphosa said in a post on X.",
      "\"We further committed to working together towards a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" he added.",
      "Ramaphosa first tried to assume the role of peacemaker in 2023 when he led a delegation of African leaders to both Kyiv and Moscow in an attempt to mediate an end to the conflict.",
      "The initiative came as South Africa faced a backlash from then-US President Joe Biden's administration, which questioned its professed neutrality in the conflict after it held a naval exercise with Russia and China.",
      "Relations worsened after Washington's then-ambassador to Pretoria accused South Africa of supplying arms and ammunition to Russia.",
      "Ramaphosa later appointed a judge-led inquiry to investigate the allegation. It found no evidence to back up the ambassador's claim, but relations between South Africa and the Biden administration remained strained.",
      "South Africa's ties with Russia have not been a sore point for Trump, as he too gets along with Putin and has been pushing Zelensky to make a deal with the Russian leader.",
      "However, Trump's relationship with South Africa has reached rock bottom over its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and for what he calls the \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white-minority Afrikaner community - an allegation Ramaphosa's government denies.",
      "Prof Zondi said South Africa would have to ensure that Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky did not hurt its attempts to mend relations with the Trump administration.",
      "\"South Africa will want to explain that it is adding to the efforts to build peace, and its role is not in competition with that of [the] US,\" he added.",
      "Ramaphosa was on cue, announcing on Thursday that he had spoken to Trump about the conflict in Ukraine.",
      "Crucially, Ramaphosa also seized the opportunity to discuss relations between South Africa and the US, and said he and Trump had agreed to meet soon.",
      "This would be their first meeting since Trump's return to office, and Ramaphosa will be hoping that US-South Africa relations get back on track.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump announced a 30% tariff on South African goods, although he later paused the hike for 90 days.",
      "Ramaphosa will be hoping that their talks lead to Trump softening his stance, as such high tariffs would be a major blow to South Africa's economy.",
      "Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky also focused on strengthening trade ties with Ukraine, as South Africa's economy was in crisis, with low growth and high unemployment.",
      "\"Any volume of trade, no matter how small, is critical for South Africa,\" Prof Zondi said, adding that strong relations between the two nations could also benefit Ukraine in its efforts to extend its influence on the continent.",
      "\"South Africa could be Ukraine's gateway to Africa because of its ports and financial systems,\" Prof Zondi said.",
      "If this happens, it would mark a new chapter in Ukraine-Africa relations, though not necessarily at the expense of Russia.",

      "On Saturday, it will also become Francis's final resting place.",

      "Santa Maria Maggiore's senior priest, the Lithuanian Rolandas Makrickas, gave Italian newspaper Il Messaggero his account of how the Pope's decision to be laid to rest there came about.",
      "He said: \"In May 2022\u2026 I asked him if he wasn't by any chance thinking about being buried in [the basilica], given how often he came.\"",

      "\"After a few times of seeing him, one time he looked at me and asked me, 'why are you always here?'",
      "\"And I said, 'Holy Father, I'm working just as you are'.\"",
      "As the security guard spoke, people continued to stream in from the blazing sunshine into the quiet shade of the basilica.",

      "After a pause, she said: \"Beautiful isn't the word. It's just vast, it's enormous.\"",
      "Apologising for not being able to put her emotions into words, she said she was \"particularly impressed\" that many of the six chapels hold different masses at different times, \"so if you're late for one, you can go into another\".",
      "Pat heard the news about the Pope's death when her plane from the UK landed in Rome on Monday morning.",

      "Malawi has become an increasingly important market for Tanzanian goods in recent years, with exports trebling between 2018 and 2023, according to official Tanzanian figures.",
      "But while Tanzania can seek alternative markets such as in Kenya, Namibia and South Sudan, Malawi may find it harder to get its goods out of the country.",
      "Much of its exports go through the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, as well as essential imports such as fuel and machinery.",
      "Losing access to Dar es Salaam would likely force Malawi to move shipments through the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala - options that may be more expensive.",
      "Bashe argued the ban was not meant to provoke a trade war but to protect Tanzania's interests.",
      "\"Tanzania will not continue to allow unequal market access to persist at the expense of its people,\" he said.",

      "The star, 23, is now among only a handful of K-pop artists who have come out publicly.",
      "Bain made the announcement in front of fans while performing a solo at a concert in Los Angeles on Tuesday night.",
      "The moment was met with loud cheers from the crowd, according to videos circulating on social media.",
      "\"To anyone out there who's part of the LGBT community, or still figuring it out - this is for you guys,\" Bain, whose real name is Song Byeong-hee, said in a video posted on his social media after the concert.",
      "\"You are seen, you are loved, and you were born this way,\" he added, before launching into a performance of Born This Way by pop icon Lady Gaga, whom he referred to as \"my queen\".",
      "His bandmates welcomed the announcement. Just B member Siwoo said he cried while watching Bain's performance. \"I know how hard it was for him, and that made me want to cry more,\" he said, according to Korean media outlet News1.",

      "Interior Minister Mazen al-Faraya told a news conference that all of the Brotherhood's offices would be closed and its assets confiscated, and that any activities would be considered illegal.",
      "There was no immediate response from the Brotherhood, which denied any links to the alleged attack plots.",
      "It is not clear how the ban will affect the group's political arm, the Islamic Action Front, which is the largest opposition group in parliament. But its headquarters was raided by police following Faraya's announcement.",

      "\"We always declare that we are committed to order, the law, and the provisions of the constitution,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, Jordan's top court ruled that the Brotherhood was \"dissolved\" because it had not settled its legal status.",

      "Last week, Jordan's General Intelligence Department said it had arrested 16 people suspected of planning attacks aimed at \"targeting national security, sowing chaos and sabotage\".",
      "They involved possession of explosives and automatic weapons, the manufacture of rockets, the concealment of one rocket ready to be launched, a project to manufacture drones, and the training of individuals both in Jordan and abroad, it said.",
      "Faraya claimed during Wednesday's news conference that members of the Brotherhood \"operate in the shadows and engage in activities that could undermine stability and security\".",
      "Authorities had found \"explosives and weapons transported between Jordanian cities and stored in residential areas\", as well as covert rocket manufacturing facilities and training and recruitment operations, he alleged.",

      "The group has denied having any involvement in, or knowledge of, the alleged attack plot and stressed that it is \"committed to its peaceful approach\".",
      "The Brotherhood was founded in Egypt almost 100 years ago and has local branches across the world. One of its aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law, or Sharia.",

    "summary": "Negotiations are gathering pace but the proposals being put forward by Trump's team still have major gaps.",
    "story": [
      "The pace of diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine is quickening.",
      "Talks are taking place in London between officials from the UK, Germany, France, Ukraine and the United States. Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is heading to Moscow for his fourth meeting with President Putin.",
      "And yet there is little clarity about where these efforts are heading or whether they will be successful.",
      "Not so long ago the American plan for ending the fighting in Ukraine was clear.",
      "There would be an immediate, unconditional 30-day ceasefire followed by longer-term talks to establish a permanent settlement to the war.",
      "Ukraine agreed to this and \u2013 under pressure from the US \u2013 made a huge concession; it would no longer demand the promise of long-term security guarantees before any cessation of hostilities.",
      "But Russia refused to play ball, insisting there could be no end to the fighting until a whole series of conditions were met.",
      "In particular, Vladimir Putin said \"the root causes\" of the war had to be addressed, namely his fears of an expanding Nato alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state somehow presenting a threat to Russia's security.",
      "The US accepted the premise of this Russian argument and is now deep in the weeds of a potential ceasefire proposal.",
      "In recent days, there have been various leaks about the latest US ideas, the status and veracity of which is disputed among diplomats.",
      "But there seems to be a framework along the following lines: Russia would halt its invasion along current lines, and would give up its ambition to control the remaining parts of the four regions of eastern Ukraine it has yet to occupy, namely Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.",
      "In return, the US would accept the four occupied territories de facto as Russian controlled.",
      "It would also recognise Crimea \u2013 which was annexed illegally by Russia in 2014 \u2013 as de jure Russian territory. The US would also ensure Ukraine ruled out joining Nato.",
      "As part of this plan, the US might also take control of the controversial Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant \u2013 currently in Russian hands \u2013 and feed the electricity to both parts of Ukrainian territory.",
      "This proposal would then be backed up with the US threat \u2013 as rehearsed by both President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2013 that it would give up on the negotiations if there was no immediate agreement.",
      "At first sight, this proposal seems unlikely to succeed.",
      "President Zelensky has already made it clear Ukraine would never concede that Crimea is Russian sovereignty.",
      "Even if he wanted to do that, he could not because it would first require a referendum of the Ukrainian people.",
      "The European powers have made clear they would not accept Russian sovereignty over Crimea, something that would breach post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by military force.",
      "Legal experts say there are even technical issues about the US recognising Crimea because of certain laws passed by the US Congress.",
      "But despite that, western diplomats do not dismiss the plan out of hand. \"There is a landing space,\" one told me. \"It is just a question of whether there is enough trust between the parties to move forward.\"",
      "They say that because the proposed deal, as leaked so far, contains huge gaps.",
      "There is no reference to any ban on western countries continuing to rearm Ukraine, something that in the past has been a red line for Russia.",
      "There is no reference, either, to Russia's demands for Ukraine to be \"demilitarised\", in other words for its army to be reduced massively in size, again another long-term Moscow demand.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine may not be allowed to join Nato but it could join the European Union.",
      "There is no apparent objection to a European \"reassurance force\" deploying to western Ukraine after any ceasefire to deter future Russian aggression.",
      "But it is still not clear if the US is willing to provide a \"backstop\" to this force. There is also uncertainty about what economic sanctions against Russia would be lifted and when, and under what circumstances.",
      "In other words, a huge amount of detail is unclear and still to be discussed.",
      "And all sides seem far apart.",
      "Ukraine still wants an immediate conditional ceasefire and then talks. The US wants a quick win. And Russia wants to get deep into the detail of a peace deal, the like of which normally takes months if not years to resolve.",
      "There is an old Russian saying that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\". Right now we seem far away from that."

    "story": [
      "Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women.",
      "\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday.",
      "In his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model.",
      "The former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.",
      "Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.",
      "\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.",
      "A court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.",
      "Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".",
      "The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.",
      "Victims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said.",
      "During his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money.",
      "\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\"",
      "Mr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters.",
      "Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.",
      "Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.",
      "He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.",
      "Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit.",
      "A judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court.",
      "His lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed.",
      "In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.",
      "He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence.",
      "The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.",
      "Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".",
      "Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.",
      "Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.",
      "His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.",
      "The former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020."

      "Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.",
      "\"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.",
      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",
      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",
      "'Problems mounting'",
      "Earlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\".",
      "Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire \"focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences\".",
      "\"I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,\" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.",

      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations \"rock-bottom\" after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.",

      "\"It is absolutely necessary [for the US] to review some of these programmes for much more efficiency and transparency,\" Mr Boulos said.",
      "\"We have to make sure the [aid funds] are going to the right place and that we are getting the desired outcome,\" he added.",

      "Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi believes US involvement in extracting the minerals could help quell the violence that has plagued the east of the country for nearly 30 years. Currently, DR Congo's mineral wealth is dominated by Chinese firms.",
      "Mr Boulos said his country was also interested in exploring minerals in neighbouring Rwanda, but called on the country to first withdraw its troops from DR Congo and stop its support for the M23. Rwanda denies involvement in the conflict.",
      "Asked if the US was only interested in benefiting economically from Africa and not its welfare, Boulos said \"our job is to promote the US interests and promote our strategic partnerships\".",
      "Trump is also determined \"to end wars and establish peace\" across the world, the envoy said, citing the conflict in Sudan as a big concern for the US government.",
      "Mr Boulos, who has served as Washington's senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December, also visited Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda in his trip.",
      "He has business interests in Africa, including in a Nigeria-based company that distributes motor vehicles and equipment in West Africa.",
      "The Lebanese-born businessman said Trump felt it was time to end the \"unfair advantage\" taken by other international players of Africa.",
      "Responding to reports in the US media that the Trump administration was planning to close most of its diplomatic missions in Africa, Mr Boulos said this was \"not very accurate\", adding: \"Africa is very important to Trump.\"",
      "On the trade tariffs announced by Trump, Mr Boulos said they had \"zero net-effect\" for most African countries as they touched on \"small trade volumes\" from the continent.",
      "\"Many countries have lined up for negotiations and at the end of the day we want fairness and a win-win solution,\" he added.",
      "The small southern African country of Lesotho was hit by the highest of the most recently announced tariffs - 50% - before they were paused for 90 days.",

      "Most of the victims were Hindu men.",
      "Some eyewitnesses said it appeared the gunmen targeted non-Muslims but others have described the shooting as random. A local Muslim man was among the victims.",
      "India's government has not given an official account on whether people were targeted on the basis of religion.",
      "Himanshi, who was on honeymoon with her husband Vinay Narwal, an Indian naval officer, can be heard saying in a video that has now gone viral that one of the attackers asked her husband if he was a Muslim.",

      "Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an \"incredible opportunity\" to strike an agreement, if China was \"serious\" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.",
      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,\" he said.",
      "The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.",
      "US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.",

      "Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a \"matter of impetus and will\".",
      "\"There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.",
      "\"If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy\u2026 if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.\"",
      "The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected a de-escalation of the trade war and that the current situation was \"not a joke\".",
      "Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.",
      "Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.",
      "Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as \"climate change, gender and social issue\".",
      "\"These issues are not the IMF's mission,\" he said.",
      "Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.",
      "Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was \"very frankly encouraged\" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.",
      "Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are \"falling short\" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.",
      "He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and \"push them to accomplish their important mandates\"."

    "story": [
      "Opposition MPs in Ghana have fiercely condemned the suspension of the country's chief justice, accusing President John Mahama of trying to \"pack the courts\" with justices who are sympathetic to the governing party, the NDC.",
      "Gertrude Torkornoo was removed from her post on Wednesday - the first time a chief justice has been suspended in the country's history.",
      "The action was taken after three petitions, which made allegations against Ms Torkornoo, were filed.",
      "The content of the petitions has not been made public and Ms Torkornoo is yet to comment openly on the matter.",
      "Mahama's supporters have backed the move as a long overdue move to clean up the judiciary.",
      "But it was condemned by the opposition as \"nothing short of a brazen judicial coup, a reckless abuse of executive power, and a direct assault on the independence of Ghana's judiciary\", the MPs said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said the chief justice was asked to step aside so that the allegations against her could be investigated.",
      "Since the suspension was announced, two more petitions have been filed against Ms Torkornoo.",
      "Former attorney general Godfred Yeboah Dame told the BBC he thought the suspension was a \"complete charade... the biggest assault on the [judiciary] in the nation's history\".",
      "Before Ms Torkornoo was suspended, lawyers filed at least two lawsuits challenging the legality of the procedure being used by the president.",
      "By law the president should have given copies of the petition to the chief justice before suspending her, which he initially failed to do. However, he did later make them available to her.",
      "The caucus of opposition MPs says that by suspending the chief justice before the Supreme Court had ruled on these lawsuits, Mahama had \"violated\" due process.",
      "But some Ghanaians support the president's move.",
      "Dr Tony Aidoo, Ghana's former ambassador to the Netherlands, told radio station Joy News: \"I think the president is protecting the judiciary in Ghana from the actions of a person who does not behave in a manner that should keep her there... if there's a stench in the room you have to let in fresh air.\"",
      "Some accuse the Supreme Court under Ms Torkornoo of siding with former President Nana Akufo-Addo and his party on several high-profile political cases.",
      "For example, last year, the justices ruled that the speaker's decision to declare four MP's seats vacant was unconstitutional.",
      "Ghana has had 15 chief justices, whose job involves overseeing the administration of justice in the country.",
      "Those that came before Ms Torkornoo ended their term by retiring - none have been suspended or permanently removed.",
      "Chief justices can only be removed from office on a few grounds, such as incompetence or misbehaviour.",
      "Ms Torkornoo is Ghana's third female chief justice and was nominated in 2023 by Akufo-Addo.",
      "According to Reuters news agency, Ms Torkornoo survived a removal request earlier this year when Akufo-Addo said a petition to have her dismissed had \"several deficiencies\".",

      "The plan's publication comes amid heightened fears over Russia's military ambitions in the region, in light of the ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

      "The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.",
      "Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.",
      "In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.",
      "Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".",
      "The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.",
      "The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.",
      "Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.",

      "US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.",
      "Investors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.",
      "Trade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.",
      "On Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.",
      "The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:34:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Three thousand names were removed from an official list of those killed in Israel's offensive.",
    "story": [
      "At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Alam Hirzallah resigns himself to a grim task: registering the deaths of the wife and two children of his grieving cousin.",
      "His family brought the bodies here on an electric rickshaw or tuk-tuk. They found them in their house in eastern Gaza City after Israeli shelling hit the family home. Asma Hirzallah, Mayar, 5, and Abdullah, 3, were killed.",
      "\"The hospital asked for their full names and ID numbers,\" explains Alam, referring to the numbers all Palestinians are given in a population registry administered by Israel.",
      "\"They gave us a paper to confirm they were martyred and told us to come back for the death certificate. Now we don't know where to go to bury them as the cemeteries are in areas under Israeli control.\"",
      "At least 51,266 people have been killed in the 18 months since the Gaza war began, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, with nearly a third of the dead aged under 18.",
      "Israel has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of the Palestinian fatalities list - in terms of overall numbers, and in particular, the demographic breakdown - claiming it is used as Hamas propaganda. The figures are cited with attribution, by UN agencies and widely in the media.",
      "The list does not distinguish between civilians and members of Palestinian armed groups who are killed in the war, and Israel has accused Hamas of inflating the percentages of women and children.",
      "Recently, several media reports have raised questions about the reliability of the statistics by highlighting anomalies between the August and October 2024 and March 2025 lists of fatalities.  The reports focus on how some 3,000 names of people originally identified as fatalities were removed from later revised lists.",
      "A Gazan health official, Zaher al-Wahidi, denied to the BBC that victims had vanished or that there was a lack of transparency, insisting: \"The health ministry works towards having accurate data with high credibility.",
      "\"In every list that gets shared, there is a greater verification and revision of the list.  We cannot say that the health ministry removes names.  It's not a removal process, rather it is a revision and verification process.\"",
      "Verifying data",
      "So how are the statistics gathered and how accurate are they?",
      "Until the first months of this war, the number of people killed in Gaza was calculated from counting bodies that arrived in hospitals - like those of Asma Hirzallah and her children.",
      "Medics could log data for all deaths into a centralised computer system, which was based at a Ministry of Health office at al-Shifa hospital, with a back-up at al-Rantissi hospital.",
      "However, as conditions became more chaotic and medical sites repeatedly came under attack, this method became less reliable. During the war, Israel says it has targeted hospitals \u2013 which have protected status under international law \u2013 because Hamas has used them to hide its fighters and infrastructure \u2013 something the armed group denies.",
      "From the start of 2024, Gazan health officials introduced online forms which relatives could use to report their loved ones dead or missing.",
      "According to Mr Wahidi, the head of statistics at the health ministry, most of the names which were recently removed from the official list as part of a new checking process had originally been submitted using these forms.  He says that names which are taken off may later be added back",
      "\"A judicial committee was set up and it looks into all of the cases received,\" Mr Wahidi says. \"To ensure credibility we verify the data so that it will be accurate.\"",
      "During investigations by the judicial committee, some people were found to have died of natural causes \u2013 not directly because of the war.  When Gazans die from lack of medical treatment, malnutrition or hypothermia, Mr Wahidi clarifies \"these cases are indirect and do not get added to the lists.\"",
      "Other individuals were wrongly listed as dead but then found to have been among thousands of Gazans imprisoned by Israel.",
      "Mr Wahidi confirms that in August and then October, a total of more than 3,000 names were removed from the list, saying this was a precautionary measure pending full checks.",
      "For some pro-Israel groups, such as media watchdog HonestReporting, this was strong indication of \"deliberate manipulation, not honest error\".",
      "There had been a widespread presumption that only checked names were included on the online lists published.",
      "\"It seems like they're actually updating the lists more in real time, as more information appears,\" says Professor Mike Spagat of Royal Holloway College, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. \"We should have regarded the previous lists as a little bit more provisional than I had assumed.\"",
      "However, he says he detects no attempt by health officials to mislead and sees the changes as \"a big clean-up operation\".",
      "He points out that the latest modifications to the list led to a small increase in the percentage of adult males among those killed, countering the idea that the original inclusion of the 3,000-plus names was done in an attempt to exaggerate the proportion of women and children.",
      "Bodies under rubble",
      "The Gaza health ministry says it has also recently audited data in its official fatalities list from hospital mortuaries for errors and omissions.",
      "When deaths were registered by friends or neighbours, it says, they often did not know the ID numbers of those killed or their full names - which include the father and grandfather's names. In some cases, this resulted in the wrong people being marked as dead.",
      "Thousands of bodies that are still under the rubble left by Israeli air strikes, as well as about 900 which are unidentified, are not currently included in the health ministry list, the ministry says.",
      "However, the recent two-month ceasefire - which allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to what was left of their homes - saw nearly 800 corpses being retrieved, identified and registered.",
      "In late January, the BBC filmed workers from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency as they set about retrieving human remains which had been left for months in Wadi Gaza - also known as the Netzarim Corridor \u2013 after a pullout by Israeli forces.",
      "With no DNA testing available in Gaza, each corpse was given a serial number. Long forms were filled in to log the bones and clothing collected to try to identify the dead.",
      "\"We look for distinctive personal belongings: a watch, a necklace or an earring. When we search the bodies, it's very possible that we'll find a driver's licence or ID card,\" said Sameh Khalifa, who led the team.",
      "\"Even a broken tooth can be a distinguishing mark that will help a family recognise a missing loved one.\"",
      "Combatant death tolls",
      "Since the resumption of Israel's military offensive in Gaza on 18 March, the numbers killed have risen daily.",
      "Israel periodically estimates the number of Palestinian fighters killed. At the start of this year, it assessed that 20,000 members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were among the dead. In mid-April it said there had been \"more than 100 targeted eliminations\" in the past month.",
      "Israel does not provide its figures for civilian deaths in Gaza and has not officially challenged any of the names on the local health ministry casualty list.",
      "The war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas led a cross-border attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 people into captivity in Gaza. Since then, the Israeli military says that 408 of its soldiers have been killed in combat.",
      "International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.",
      "We rely heavily on local Palestinian journalists working with us to access information about deadly attacks - interviewing witnesses as well as visiting bomb sites and hospital mortuaries to film footage, which is shared with us.",
      "Overall, the numbers killed in the past year and a half dwarf those from previous rounds of fighting in the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict and yet, for the moment, there is no end in sight to the war.",

      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",

      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",

    "summary": "From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",
    "story": [
      "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.",
      "Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".",
      "Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "China can take the pain (to a point)",
      "China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.",
      "With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.",
      "Beijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change.",
      "And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.",
      "The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.",
      "China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.",
      "Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.",
      "The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.",
      "The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".",
      "President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"",
      "China has been investing in the future",
      "China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.",
      "Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.",
      "It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.",
      "Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.",
      "Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.",
      "US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.",
      "That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",
      "Lessons from Trump 1.0",
      "Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.",
      "It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.",
      "American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.",
      "\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.",
      "The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.",
      "That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.",
      "Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".",
      "That would be an impossible choice for much of the world",
      "\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.",
      "China now knows when Trump will blink",
      "Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".",
      "But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.",
      "Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.",
      "China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.",
      "Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".",
      "But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.",
      "Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.",
      "China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"",
      "A chokehold on rare earths",
      "What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.",
      "China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.",
      "Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.",
      "China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.",
      "In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.",
      "The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously.",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

    "summary": "Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff.",
    "story": [
      "If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa.",
      "The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase.",
      "While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.",
      "When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?",
      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",
      "But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\".",
      "\"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said.",
      "However, he also said that: \"Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\"",
      "And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.",
      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",
      "\"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\"",

    "story": [
      "Shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017, Tindu Lissu is the great survivor of Tanzanian politics - and one of its most persecuted politicians.",
      "But some are asking whether he has now reached the the end of the line.",
      "Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chadema, is back in the limelight after being charged with treason - a crime for which the maximum sentence is the death penalty.",
      "Still, he is undeterred. Despite the enormous risk, he believes he can pressure the government to institute reforms, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in October.",
      "But can he weather the storm in a harsh political environment, and against what he believes are politically driven charges?",
      "His party has been disqualified from the elections and he has been in detention for the past two weeks.",
      "In September last year, Lissu told the BBC that nothing would come on a silver platter, and it would take courage to demand reforms \"on the streets and in the villages\".",
      "To achieve his goals, he felt he had to take over Chadema's leadership.",
      "A fiery politician, Lissu was critical of the way the party was being run, accusing then chairman Freeman Mbowe of being too reconciliatory towards the government.",
      "In an intense race, he ousted Mbowe from the post.",
      "After just three months at the helm of Chadema, Lissu was this month arrested and detained for a speech allegedly calling for the public to launch a rebellion and disrupt the elections.",
      "He was not allowed to enter a plea on the treason charge but pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of publishing false information.",
      "Prior to his arrest, he had been holding gatherings across the country with a rallying call of \"no reforms, no elections\".",
      "He said the current system was rigged in favour of the ruling CCM party, adding that without reforms, there was no point in taking part in the elections.",
      "He is due to reappear in court on Thursday. He cannot seek bail because he has been charged with treason.",
      "His international lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told the BBC that it was their \"mission to defend democracy\".",
      "Yet it is no simple task - CCM has won every election since independence, and is unlikely to easily let go of its stranglehold on power.",
      "There is also a rift in Chadema, with some members disagreeing with Lissu's strategy.",
      "The party is barred from contesting October's election after it refused to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.",
      "The document's key objective \"is to ensure that political parties and their supporters behave well... and maintain peace and harmony\" during the elections.",
      "Chadema sees the code of conduct as a ploy to contain the opposition, and it fears that state repression will continue.",
      "In September a senior Chadema party official was abducted and brutally killed amid a wave of abductions of government critics.",
      "During local elections in November, Chadema said thousands of its candidates were barred from participating. The ruling party won about 98% of the seats.",
      "The government dismissed suggestions that the elections were not free and fair, saying they were held in accordance with the rules.",
      "But for Lissu, the local elections justified his calls for reforms ahead of the presidential and parliamentary polls.",

      "But the arrest of opposition politicians has continued, despite Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa promising earlier this month that the authorities would ensure security and fairness in the polls.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the government for comment.",
      "President Samia Suluhu Hassan gave Tanzanians greater political freedom after she took office following the death in office of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021.",
      "However, Tanzania was once again \"beginning to see the wave of repression and state-orchestrated violence\" that characterised Magufuli's rule, Tanzanian political analyst Nicodemus Minde said.",
      "It was during that era that Lissu survived an assassination attempt.",
      "Before his arrest, Lissu said his party had a list of \"minimum but critical reforms that must be made to guarantee free elections\".",
      "Mr Amsterdam, his lawyer, told the BBC that this included the formation of \"a truly independent national electoral commission with members unconnected to the government\" - and this must be enshrined in the constitution.",
      "Chadema is also demanding that when there are electoral disputes, the burden of proof should lie with the commission to show that the vote was free and fair.",
      "Lissu's strategy has come at a heavy cost to himself and Chadema, as a faction within the party, known as G-55,  has adopted a softer stance.",
      "It has called for the party to contest the elections while pursuing talks with the government over its demands.",
      "That is the approach taken by the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo.",
      "Along with 16 fringe opposition parties, it has signed the code of conduct. Only Chadema has refused.",
      "Lissu appears to see neighbouring Kenya - where mass protests last year forced the government to drop plans to increase taxes - as a model to follow.",
      "At the time, he told the BBC that Tanzanians had not \"pressed hard enough for democratic reform\", and what Kenya went through in order to get [its] democratic dispensation is something that we need to do\".",
      "Whether such a strategy would work is unclear, as many Tanzanians appear reluctant to publicly support a campaign that could rattle the government.",
      "But Mr Amsterdam said the more intransigent the government, the more it would spur Chadema's supporters \"to push forward and engage in civil disobedience\".",
      "He added that Chadema would use \"every legal and political tool\" to achieve change.",
      "But political analyst Thomas Kibwana criticised Lissu's strategy, saying that with the term of the current parliament due to end in June there would not be enough time to give legal effect to any major reforms ahead of the October election.",
      "He said it might be better for Chadema to wait until after the election.",
      "Fulgence Massawe, the director of a legal rights organisation in Tanzania, told the BBC that Chadema's push for electoral reforms faced significant hurdles, but the party had the right to go to court to challenge its exclusion from the elections.",
      "Mr Minde said that if Chadema remained shut out of the elections, the ruling party is likely to increase its already overwhelming majority in parliament.",
      "The analyst added that Chadema might even lose its standing as the main opposition party, and \"of course nature pulls back and probably other opposition parties will seize this opportunity\".",

    "summary": "A total of 370 out of 882 Indian laws criminalise 7,305 acts - from missed dog walks to murder.",
    "story": [
      "In India, you can face criminal charges for tethering an animal on the street, flying a kite in a manner that causes alarm, skipping a school attendance order or handing a feeding bottle to a mother who can't breastfeed.",
      "Of the 882 federal laws on the books, 370 contain criminal provisions - together criminalising 7,305 acts and omissions. These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.",
      "Delhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".",
      "In a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.",
      "The report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\".",
      "You could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked.",
      "Then there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.",
      "Let your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.",
      "Promoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)",
      "Jail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.",
      "More than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds.",
      "Some 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\".",
      "Even the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.",
      "Out of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees.",
      "To be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.",
      "\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.",
      "\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"",
      "This \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says.",
      "Businesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.",
      "The report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.",
      "Rioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment.",
      "The irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.",
      "Even more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.",
      "The sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.",
      "\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"",
      "Over 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages",
      "Even the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.",
      "\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.",
      "It says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.",
      "Authorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen."

      "On Sunday in his Easter message, his last public appearance, he was again calling for peace and a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "With his words read by an aide, he said: \"The terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.''",
      "\"War is not just weapons.  War is sometimes words,\" the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said when I asked him about the Pope's final address.  He said the Pope had a moral clarity.",
      "\"Pope Francis recently, especially in the last year, has been very outspoken about the situation of the Holy Land, calling for the liberation of the hostages, but also condemning the dramatic situation, the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation for Palestinians,\" the cardinal said.",
      "Israeli media has noted that while President Isaac Herzog expressed condolences to the Catholic world, there were not similar comments from the prime minister or foreign minister as would have been expected - widely attributed to the Pope's strong positions against the Gaza war.",
      "Some of his most explicit criticism of Israel came late last year when excerpts of an upcoming book were published.",
      "\"According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,\" Pope Francis wrote.",
      "\"It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.\"",
      "Israel firmly rejects allegations of genocide in Gaza and says its war goal is to defeat Hamas.",

      "At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.",

      "However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.",
      "His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.",
      "Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.",
      "The fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.",

      "\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.",
      "During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.",
      "He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.",
      "The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.",

      "Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.",
      "Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.",
      "Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.",
      "Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.",
      "\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.",
      "Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.",
      "The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.",
      "Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.",
      "\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.",
      "The \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.",
      "There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"",
      "The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.",
      "Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.",
      "The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.",
      "Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.",
      "But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".",
      "The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.",

      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",
      "For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.",
      "Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?",
      "Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.",

      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "VISUAL GUIDE: How the next Pope is chosen by secret vote",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

      "When the world learned of Pope Francis' death on Monday morning, an Irish-American cardinal, little known in the wider world, was the one to break the news.",
      "After announcing that the pope had \"returned to the home of the Father\", Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took on one of his biggest roles yet: the \"camerlengo\", or the person who runs the Vatican after the death or resignation of a pope.",
      "Pope Francis nominated the cardinal for the role in 2019. The cardinal will remain in the position during the \"Apostolica Sedes Vacans\", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff.",
      "He also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis.",
      "Born in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican.",
      "He held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "All told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US.",

      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",

      "\"I wanted to be a singer, but you know, this little town was about that big and there were no singers there and that's what my mom said. My mom, as, you know, as much as I loved her and she wanted the best for me, she would've done anything for me to be a singer, she really didn't have any hope.\"",

Not because they wanted to, because they didn't want me to be disappointed or hurt,\" she said. \"I told my girls that all the time, you could be whatever you wanna be. You could do whatever you wanna do and I'm gonna be right there to help make it happen.\"",
      "Impact on parenting",
      "Knowles spoke with King about how different her daughters were growing up. She said once a teacher recommended Beyonc\u00e9 repeat a grade in school. Knowles said, now a global superstar, Beyonc\u00e9 was shy and quiet until she got to know people.",
      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",
      "\"I took her to Ms. Little. ... Was an ex-teacher there who was very stern, but she said, 'there's nothing wrong with this girl. This girl is very bright. She just doesn't care to let you know it.'\"",
      "Conversely, Knowles described Solange as \"very outgoing\" and would \"walk into the room and be like, 'yes, I'm here.'\"",
      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",
      "\"He was like, 'I don't want any parts of that,'\" Knowles said.",
      "For Knowles it was important as she started to see separation between her two daughters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 had become like this little star in the town and she was always so close to Solange and so kind to her, but then she was in the singing group, so everything took place in our house,\" she said. The other girls in the group would tell Solange to shut up and be quiet and all that and I started noticing that she wasn't protecting her sister.\"",
      "Knowles' goal through therapy was to ensure the two grew up close, telling King, \"whatever I have to do to make that happen.\"",
      "Beginnings of Destiny's Child",
      "Knowles said she tried to be a singer, and although for her it didn't work out, she used her skills to help her daughters achieve their dreams.",
      "\"God has always given me these tools from day one that I could go back and pull out and who would've ever thought that I would wind up making costumes for Destiny's Child? Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",

      "\"He was just bold and when I talk about him, that's one of the things that he went to bat for me all the time, he fought, he protected me.\"",
      "Navigating marriage and parenting criticisms",
      "Knowles also wrote candidly in her memoir about the highs and lows of her 30-year marriage to Mathew Knowles.",
      "She said from the beginning, there was infidelity in their marriage on his part and she realized she needed to be prepared.",
      "\"I was pregnant and things were \u2014 they just got really bad at that time. I knew that I had to make a move and I didn't want to be dependent on him,\" she said.",
      "She started planning what she called her escape plan. Knowles opened a hair salon called Headliners, which was so successful it became the family's main source of income and helped to fund Beyonc\u00e9's budding musical career. Mathew Knowles left his sales executive role at Xerox and started working as Destiny's Child's manager full-time. Their partnership as parents helped to hold their marriage together.",
      "\"People say to me, 'how did you stay so long?' And I'm like, 'well, I was married for 33 years, but 33 years were not bad.' \u2026 You know, maybe 15 of them were bad, but we would have these long stretches where we would do really great.\"",
      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",

      "\"They didn't know the backstory of Solange losing her best friend and wanting to hurry up and be a grownup 'cause she thought she wouldn't live so long.\"",
      "Knowles said Solange made it clear she was getting married.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, well let me at least give you a wedding,' you know, and made it memorable for her,\u00a0 but you can't control somebody else's life. It's their life.\"",
      "Knowles also wrote about an untrue rumor that surfaced during Beyonc\u00e9's first pregnancy, where people said she wasn't carrying the baby.",
      "\"She went on a show in Australia and she had this very broad cloth type of dress,\" Knowles said about Beyonc\u00e9. \"She wasn't huge pregnant. She was very proud of her little stomach and she bent over and the fabric of the dress bent \u2026 they started this vicious, horrible rumor that she wasn't pregnant.\"",
      "Knowles expressed her heartache over the situation and anger over people thinking her daughter faked a pregnancy and used prosthetics.",
      "\"I was never so enraged because this should have been a sacred experience and what they didn't know is that my child had been through a couple miscarriages, which were so painful.\"",
      "Knowles admitted she did not speak up even as the devastating rumor escalated, saying that Beyonc\u00e9 thought it would go away and handles these situations well.",
      "\"I'm not so good at that. I will cuss you out about my kids,\" Knowles said. \"That was one of the worst times of my life. It really was. I would cry, I would get so mad and I would get so upset.\"",
      "Divorces and moving forward",
      "When she decided to get divorced from Mathew Knowles, she said she spent a week in bed depressed. Her longtime therapist gave her an exercise to do: Make a list of accomplishments and failures.",
      "\"I had such an easy time writing the bad stuff. When I got to the positive stuff, I had such a hard time,\" she said. \"What I realized about myself is that I wasn't really comfortable with people telling me great things about me.\"",
      "She said she had not taken credit for some of her accomplishments in the past, like her work with Destiny's Child in an effort to be humble. She would tell herself, \"it's not about you.\"",
      "But then she started making her list.",
      "\"I started getting mad and writing those things down,\" she said. \"I started my salon. It was a success. You know, I raised some great kids. All the people I've met in my life, like I have had a hell of a life.\"",
      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",
      "She said she would love to find love again, but is at peace if she doesn't.",
      "\"I am finally feeling \u2014 it is sad that I'm 71 years old and I know that I am enough and if I don't I'm gonna be just fine because I got such a full, great life. And I'm so blessed, and you know, it's gonna be \u2013 it's all good.\"",

      "Knowles also shares how she named the group Destiny's Child.",
      "\"I put their picture in my NIV study Bible, and one day I opened it, and it said 'Destiny.' And I was like, that's the name. And my ex-husband added 'child' to it because it was already a group by that name.\"",

I have to be deliberate and intentional ... I just didn't want to screw that up, because I screw some stuff up.\"",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",
      "For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,I am the very model of a modern Major-General!",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",

      "After the dinner offer was posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and X account, the value of the meme coin surged as much as $5.32, or 58%, to $14.32 on Wednesday afternoon.

      "The dinner offer promises $TRUMP coin investors the opportunity to \"Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!\" Mr. Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, has also pushed his own ventures into the realm of digital products, issuing everything from NFTs billed as \"Trump digital trading cards\" to a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial.",

The moves came after weeks of escalation between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\"",
      "\"We speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,\" Tuesday's letter read.",

      "\"Most fundamentally,\" the letter reads, \"America's colleges and universities prepare an educated citizenry to sustain our democracy.",

On behalf of our current and future students, and all who work at and benefit from our institutions, we call for constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.\"",

      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",

And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription.

      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "summary": "Federal health officials want companies to swap out certain food dyes with natural alternatives.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Tesla's sales and stock price have taken a hit this year amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",
      "Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:18:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Record consumer debt, years of steep inflation and other factors are driving more Americans to considering filing for bankruptcy.",
    "story": [
      "The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is soaring to its highest level since just before the pandemic, a potentially alarming sign as clouds gather over the economy.",
      "Personal bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first three months of the year, according to data from LegalShield, a provider of consumer legal services. The jump could augur a potential wave of\u00a0bankruptcy filings\u00a0as consumers start to buckle under a record level of debt and as\u00a0tariffs fuel inflation, the company warned in a report this week.",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but fell sharply during the pandemic itself as Americans were buoyed by trillions of dollars in government aid and relief.",
      "LegalShield now expects bankruptcies to surge as soon as this this summer. \"Consumers are calling lawyers to ask questions because they can't pay their bills or are having trouble, and they ask about the process of filing for bankruptcy,\" Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Why are more Americans mulling bankruptcy?",
      "Heavy consumer debts, years of stiff inflation and higher interest rates are squeezing Americans' budgets, according to Layton. Billing disputes, debt collections and other leading indicators of bankruptcy are also on the rise.",
      "\"Our members are calling and saying, 'I don't have enough money at the end of month to pay my bills.' They're asking which ones to pay and which ones to put off. They're saying, 'They're coming to get my car \u2014 what can I do about these things?'\" Layton said.",
      "The jump in Americans who are considering declaring bankruptcy reflects the tough economic economic and financial conditions that have prevailed 2020, experts said. Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

      "The Trump administration is planning on ending Direct File, the Associated Press reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the plan. The program, launched during Joe Biden's presidency, has been credited by some users with making it easier and cheaper to file their taxes, saving the average user $160 in tax preparation fees and hours of their time, according to the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group focused on enhancing financial fairness and security for Americans.",
      "But the IRS has also faced blowback to Direct File from private tax prep companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software.",
      "\"Direct File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars,\" Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, told the AP.",
      "DirectFile was used by about 141,000 taxpayers in 12 states when it debuted in 2024, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Although it was expanded to 25 states in 2025, the IRS hasn't yet released data on how many people used it during the tax season that ended on April 15.",
      "$100 billion on tax prep",
      "Americans spend more than $100 billion each year to prepare and file their returns, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Direct File was developed as a method to help taxpayers avoid paying tax-prep and filing fees.",
      "However, Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies \u2014 including Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, H&R Block \u2014 have complained the Direct File program is a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist. One such service is Free File, a partnership between the IRS and tax-prep companies.",
      "On Monday, more than 170 Democratic and independent lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and IRS acting commissioner Michael Faulkender asking them to commit to keeping Direct File open and operating. No Republican lawmakers signed the letter.",
      "\"Ending this free, easy-to-use and popular program would be an insult to American taxpayers, eliminating an important alternative to commercial options provided by the tax prep industry,\" the Democratic lawmakers, led by by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote in the April 21 letter.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to eliminate up to 40% of its roughly 100,000-person workforce after the end of tax filing season, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News. The agency is also expected to shed more than 20,000 IRS employees through its Deferred Resignation Program offer.",
      "Those changes are part of the Trump administration's efforts, overseen by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending.",
      "\"No decisions on the future of Direct File have been made as of yet,\" a Treasury spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It is a failed program at a cost of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars per year.\"",
      "Pushback against Direct File",
      "Direct File has drawn pushback from some Republican lawmakers, with more than 20 GOP representatives asking President Trump to \"immediately end the IRS' unlawful Direct File pilot program upon taking office in January,\" according to a Dec. 10 statement from Rep. Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska.",
      "\"The program's creation and ongoing expansion pose a threat to taxpayers' freedom from government overreach, and its shaky rollout and structural flaws have already come at a steep price,\" the Republican lawmakers said in their\u00a0letter.",
      "The IRS spent about $13 million on the Direct File pilot in 2024, according a December\u00a0report from the GAO. That funding came from money the tax agency received from the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law in 2022.",
      "While consumer advocacy groups and some tax experts have praised Direct File for creating a free pathway for some taxpayers to file their returns, the service hasn't earned universal praise.",
      "Direct File was \"problematic\" from the start, David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government's effects on the economy, told the AP.",
      "Pointing to the program's costs, Williams noted that many people who start the free-filing process never finish. According to the IRS, while 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File in 2024, only 140,803 of them submitted accepted returns.",
      "Despite those criticisms, taxpayers who have used Direct File give the program high marks. About 96% of taxpayers who used the 2024 pilot program said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the service, a Code for America survey found.",

The IMF projects the country's economy will expand 4% this year, down roughly half a point from its previous forecast. President Trump's\u00a0tariffs on China now total 145%. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods total 125%.",

    "summary": "Harvard President Alan Garber said the university is suing the Trump administration over freezing federal funding.",
    "story": [
      "Harvard University on Monday said it has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding.",
      "In announcing the suit, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter\u00a0to the Harvard community that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants.",
      "The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "\"These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers and the standing of American higher education in the world,\" Garber wrote.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "\"Defendants' actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and place at risk critical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Trump administration said, \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families, is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"",
      "Research at Harvard has helped develop drugs that treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, led to the development of nanofibers that protect first responders and service members, and contributed to innovation in cancer-detecting artificial intelligence technology, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Harvard isn't the only university facing pressure from the Trump administration, which has said it is taking action against some schools to ensure they combat anti-semitism on campuses.",
      "The administration threatened last month to cancel $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University, citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" Cornell and Northwestern are also facing funding freezes totaling a combined $1.8 billion.",
      "Yet the battle between Harvard and the Trump administration has become far more public and heated than those at other universities. Aside from the funding stoppage, the Trump administration also threatened to block the Massachusetts university from enrolling international students.",
      "The White House also called for broad leadership reforms at the university and changes to admissions policies.",
      "Harvard leaders frame the Trump administration's demands as a threat not only to the Ivy League school but also to the autonomy that the Supreme Court has long granted American universities. For the White House, Harvard presents a major hurdle in its effort to force change at universities that Republicans claim have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "In its suit, Harvard alleges the Trump administration also \"failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress required under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring the freeze unlawful.\"",
      "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin from programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Harvard's complaint against the Trump administration also claims the halt in federal funding will impede critical scientific and medical research as well as diminish economic innovation.",
      "\"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" Garber wrote. \"Research that the government has put in jeopardy includes efforts to improve the prospects of children who survive cancer, to understand at the molecular level how cancer spreads throughout the body, to predict the spread of infectious disease outbreaks, and to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield.\"",

It also claims that Walgreens pressured its workers to fill the prescriptions quickly without regard for proper legal protocols.",

      "The Justice Department filed its original lawsuit against the national drugstore chain on Jan. 16, claiming that Walgreens dispensed unlawful prescriptions and then sought reimbursement for the drugs from Medicare and other federal health care programs. In doing so, the agency said Walgreens violated the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)\u2014 which regulates the distribution of regulated substances \u2014 and the False Claims Act (FCA).",
      "Walgreens has over 8,000 pharmacies across the United States.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with the government's legal theory and admit no liability,\" a spokesperson for Walgreens told CBS MoneyWatch in an email Monday. \"Our pharmacists are dedicated health care professionals who care deeply about patient safety and continue to play a critical role in providing education and resources to help combat opioid misuse and abuse across our country.\"",
      "If Walgreens had been found liable, it could have been fined up to $80,850 for each prescription filled in violation of the CSA, according to January statement from the Department of Justice.",

      "President Trump and his team have floated the idea of firing Powell, who Mr. Trump tapped to lead the central bank during his first term in 2017. Although many legal experts \u2014 and Powell himself \u2014 say the president lacks authority to fire a Fed chief, Mr. Trump's fierce criticism has fueled investor concerns that the White House could defy norms and seek to replace the central bank chief.",
      "Referring to Powell, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social on Monday that the economy could slow down \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put increasing pressure on Powell to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which would spur economic growth but also risk boosting inflation.",
      "\"The problem is that Powell's term still has more than a year to go while Trump's tariffs haven't even shown up in the data, which means the battle between the Fed and White House could get a lot worse in the coming months,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "A landmark Supreme Court Ruling from 1935 upholds the independent authority of the Fed and would make it difficult to fire Powell before his term concludes on May 15, 2026. But that hasn't stopped Mr. Trump from taking aim at Powell, who has stood firm against cutting interest rates until the Fed has more economic data on how tariffs will affect the economy.",

      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",

      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",

      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",

      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was worried the layoffs would violate earlier court decisions. In her written order, she said the administration was poised to \"decimate the agency and render it unable to comply with its statutory duties.\" If the plan were allowed to proceed, \"there will be no agency standing\" by the time she renders a decision on an earlier lawsuit filed by an employee union that wants to preserve the bureau.",
      "Trump administration officials argue that it has\u00a0overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission, amounting to an existential crisis for \u00a0government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "Banning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",
      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If they succeed, CEOs and Wall Street will once again be free to trick, trap and cheat you,\" Warren stated in a videotaped post.",

      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in India on Monday for a four-day visit as New Delhi looks to avoid U.S. tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington and strengthen ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the first day of his largely personal visit. The two leaders are expected to hold discussions on bilateral ties outlined in February when Modi met President Trump in Washington.",
      "The U.S. is India's largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aimed at sealing a bilateral trade agreement this year.",
      "Shortly after his arrival in New Delhi, word came that Pope Francis had died. Vance had met with Francis in Rome on Easter Sunday.",
      "Vance posted his condolences on X, saying,\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.   I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful.    May God rest his soul.\"",
      "Modi, whose country has nearly 30 million Christians who make up 2.3% of the population, says Francis will always be remembered \"as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world.",
      "\"From a young age, he devoted himself towards realizing the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope,\" Modi said.",
      "The Indian leader posted a photo of himself with the pope and said he was \"greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development.\"",
      "The U.S. and India have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "Vance's first visit to New Delhi comes amid the backdrop of Mr. Trump's now-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi's main rival in the region.",
      "Modi and Vance are expected to \"review the progress in bilateral relations\" and \"exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,\" India's Foreign Ministry said last week.",
      "\"We are very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties,\" spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.",
      "Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi's Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome. He is accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their children and officials from the U.S. administration.",
      "The couple and their three young children visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort \u2014 a UNESCO world heritage site \u2014 during their trip.",
      "Why U.S.-India ties matter",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It's also part of \"the Quad,\" which is comprised of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China's expansion in the region. Mr. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Mr. Trump during his first term in office and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Mr. Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration's demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",
      "Regardless, Mr. Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a \"tariff abuser\" and \"tariff king.\"",

    "summary": "Trump administration economist Kevin Hassett said Powell's removal is being studied by the president and his team.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and his team are studying whether firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is an option, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.",
      "Though appointed by the president and approved by Congress, the Federal Reserve chair is an independent\u00a0role. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017 and was renominated to serve another 4-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "\"The President and his team will continue to study that matter,\" Hassett said when asked during a press gaggle on Friday if removing Powell from his post was likely.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday took aim at Powell\u00a0in a social media post, writing that the Fed should be cutting interest rates, and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "In a speech delivered on Wednesday, Powell\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Trump administration's trade war could result in a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. That economic mix describes stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that characterizes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "On Wednesday, Powell also reiterated that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now, also sparking pushback from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He's too late. Always too late. A little slow and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it and \u2014 if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday at the White House.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose board members could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that presidents may not legally fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "But Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, reported Reuters on Wednesday. And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",
      "Fed governor Kevin Warsh, 55, is a former Morgan Stanley executive who was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by President George W. Bush.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday. However, Warsh has advised Mr. Trump to allow Powell to remain through the end of his term, the publication added.",
      "Widely respected, Warsh is considered to be even more hawkish \u2014 or willing to allow interest rates to remain high to control inflation \u2014 than Powell, according to a January blog post\u00a0by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.",

    "summary": "President Trump also signed an executive order to enforce laws on the books about universities disclosing large foreign gifts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aiming to change the college accreditation process so colleges are accredited based on \"results,\" with the president wondering aloud about looking into the math capabilities of students admitted to Harvard University and Yale University.",
      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",
      "The new executive orders come as the president has singled out Harvard University. His administration has frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard, demanded sweeping changes to school policies and suggested it should lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",
      "The Trump administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on \"woke ideology\" instead of results, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. The executive order Mr. Trump signed affects law schools and graduate programs as well.",
      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. Harvard told CBS News in a statement it has filed foreign gift reporting reports \"for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.\"",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of U.S. universities and colleges, including Harvard, Princeton, Penn, Brown, MIT, Cornell and Tufts issued a joint letter Tuesday condemning President Trump's \"political interference\" in the nation's education system.",
      "The move comes a day after Harvard University sued the Trump administration, which announced an initial funding freeze of\u00a0$2.2 billion\u00a0and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. The moves came after weeks of escalation between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\"",
      "\"We speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,\" Tuesday's letter read.",
      "\"We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight. However, we must oppose undue government intrusion,\" it said, adding: \"We must reject the coercive use of public research funding.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to bring several prestigious universities to heel over claims they tolerated campus antisemitism,\u00a0threatening their budgets and tax-exempt status and the enrollment of foreign students.",
      "The letter said the universities and colleges were committed to serving as centers where \"faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.\"",
      "\"Most fundamentally,\" the letter reads, \"America's colleges and universities prepare an educated citizenry to sustain our democracy.",
      "\"The price of abridging the defining freedoms of American higher education will be paid by our students and our society. On behalf of our current and future students, and all who work at and benefit from our institutions, we call for constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's confrontations with universities has seen him threaten to cut federal funding at schools beyond Harvard over their policies meant to encourage diversity among students and staff.",
      "The president has also pursued a wide-ranging immigration crackdown that has expanded to foreign students.",
      "The White House has publicly justified its campaign as a reaction to uncontrolled \"antisemitism\" and the desire to reverse diversity programs aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.",
      "The administration claims protests against Israel's war in Gaza that swept across U.S. college campuses last year were rife with antisemitism.",
      "Many U.S. schools, including Harvard, cracked down on the protests over the allegations at the time.",

      "Bessent, who delivered the keynote address at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C., today, said that the Trump administration wants the U.S. economy to rebalance toward more manufacturing, while urging China to shift away from what he called \"export-led manufacturing growth.\"",
      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change \u2014 because we need rebalancing too,\" Bessent said in the speech.",
      "Beijing's export-reliant economic model is \"unsustainable\" and harms both China and the rest of the world, Bessent added. At the same time, the Treasury chief maintained that \"America First does not mean America alone,\" a comment that comes after the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration is considering slashing tariffs on China to de-escalate tensions between the two largest global economies.",
      "The stock market rose sharply on Wednesday following news that the trade war could cool off, and after President Trump said he has no plans to oust Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "Earlier this month, China hiked its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports \u2014 although those import taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products from China.",

      "The chief executives of Walmart and Target privately warned President Trump this week that his sweeping tariff policy could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves in the coming weeks, sources familiar with the White House meeting told CBS News.",

      "Target, in a similar statement, said \"we had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "The two retailers have publicly warned that Mr. Trump's tariffs could lead to higher prices. Weeks after Mr. Trump's election win, Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC, \"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\"",
      "And last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" from tariffs planned on imports from Mexico, noting Target heavily relies on Mexican produce to stock its grocery shelves in the winter.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on most other countries. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other U.S. trading partners earlier this month, but paused most of the non-China levies for 90 days.",
      "The import duties have rattled markets in recent weeks and prompted fears about rising consumer prices, slower economic growth and supply chain shortfalls. The Trump administration has considered forming a working group to handle any strains on supply chains caused by the China tariffs, CBS News reported last week.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy, casting it as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and stymie what he views as unfair trade practices \u2014 but he has indicated he would like to negotiate new trade deals with other countries.

    "story": [
      "Lindsay Brown was working from home in Little Rock, Arkansas, when, during a company meeting in February, her employer said that due to the United States Agency for International Development  not making payments to the organization, staff changes needed to happen.",
      "Brown, who worked in internal communications for the nonprofit FHI 360, has been furloughed since shortly after that meeting.",
      "She learned that her last day at FHI 360 will be May 2.",
      "She is one of the close to 20,000 employees \u2014 many living in states such as North Carolina, Vermont, California and Georgia \u2014   who lost their jobs as the Trump administration took steps to shutter USAID.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has authority over the agency, said on Tuesday that the government plans to make staffing cuts, eliminating every position at the agency not required by law, and consolidate domestic offices at the State Department. The impending cuts are most likely to be felt by workers outside of Washington, D.C., already reeling from the decimation of their livelihoods and fields.",
      "USAID provided federal funding to hundreds of companies, organizations and universities to help run programs and research dedicated to various aspects of foreign aid. These companies employed people around the country, many of whom have already been furloughed, and are now finding out their positions have been eliminated.",
      "USAIDstopwork, a website tracking the economic impact of the USAID funding cuts, determined that\u00a019,187 American jobs\u00a0have been lost as of Wednesday. The tracker found\u00a0a total of 46 states were affected by job cuts and that, outside of Maryland and Virginia, some of the most impacted states were North Carolina, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and California. In Georgia, for example, USAID funded 18 organizations that ran 79 programs, and 44 of those programs were shuttered, leading to layoffs and an estimated loss of $257.9 million.",
      "For workers living in states outside the beltway, job loss can be particularly isolating.",
      "\"I have used all my savings during this furlough while FHI 360 fights to get the government to pay what it is owed. Being in Arkansas and getting resources like unemployment has been very difficult,\" Brown told CBS News. She said the organization has communicated with staff about the impending cuts, but it didn't make the layoffs any easier.",

      "\"Layoff trauma hit across the country,\" said Vota, adding the pain of USAID cuts extend beyond federal workers living in Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia. He pointed to his newsletter Career Pivot, which he started in the aftermath of the mass cuts in February as a way to help fellow contractors and federal workers who were affected by the USAID cuts. It's already grown to an audience of more than 12,000 subscribers as more federal agencies face staffing and budget cuts, he told CBS News.",
      "He anticipates the crisis will get worse when the remaining USAID workers who are still receiving their salaries stop getting paid. The vast majority of USAID employees will lose their jobs on either July 1 or Sept. 2, according to a memorandum to staff obtained by CBS News.",
      "Vota said several job seekers living outside the Washington, D.C., corridor are searching for work in the private sector or state government. Others are exiting the formal job market, he said, because the type of work they did is limited in the state where they live. Vota said job seekers tell him, \"I don't see anything I can or want to do in the formal job market, so I am going to take any job, driving Ubers, waiting tables, cause my dream is dead and I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.\"",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio that can be used to prepare for television appearances, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, according to two of the sources, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures.",
      "\"Changes and upgrades to the Pentagon Briefing Room are nothing new and routinely happen during changes in an administration,\" a Defense Department spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The renovation that was initially planned was estimated to cost more than $40,000, but the ideas were scaled back, sources said.",
      "After CBS News published its report, the defense secretary responded in a post on X, \"Totally fake story. No 'orders' and no 'makeup.'\"",
      "Hegseth, before becoming defense secretary, was a morning show co-host on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\" Since his nomination, he has vowed to emphasize improvements in the armed forces' warfighting abilities and military readiness.",
      "An in-house construction crew renovated the adjacent green room earlier this year. The room previously had minimal furnishings \u2014 a table with chairs, a TV, photos of former defense secretaries and a mirror on the back of the door, one source said.",
      "The table was removed and a new chair and large mirror with makeup lighting was installed, another source said.",
      "Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said.",
      "The Defense Department spokesperson said the green room will be available to senior leaders and VIPs prior to press engagements.",
      "The new items, including a director's chair, came from existing inventories, the spokesperson said. A new countertop was constructed by facilities services staff.",
      "\"For this upgrade we were deliberately conservative and opted for several less expensive, on-hand materiel solutions,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Hegseth hasn't used the press room to brief reporters. But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",
      "Hegseth claims he did not disclose classified information in either of the chat groups. The Defense Department acting inspector general is reviewing his disclosures.",
      "\"We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on the president's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon, and I'm proud of it,\" Hegseth said Tuesday on Fox.",
      "The Pentagon restricted access to its briefing room on Feb. 21, barring reporters unless officials were speaking. Previously, press could use the room, one of the few places they could connect to Wi-Fi in the secure building, to file stories and to conduct on-camera reports.",

Lauren Underwood, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and 8th District U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi.",
      "Colleagues pay tribute to Durbin's career",
      "A number of legislators took time Wednesday morning to share tributes to Durbin's long career in politics.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a fellow Democrat, praised Durbin \"for his exemplary career of public service as well as the profound and lasting positive impact he's had on Illinois families and our nation.\" He added:",
      "\"Known for his legendary work ethic, Senator Durbin has led the fight to expand access to affordable health care, invest in our state's infrastructure, tackle gun violence, defend Dreamers, improve public health, protect working families, and more. His expert leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee ensured the confirmation of a record 235 federal judges, shaping the courts and securing our most fundamental American rights for many years to come.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Decatur, Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker honored Durbin, saying, \"Let's all recognize someone serving us for decades in Washington D.C., representing the state of Illinois with enormous integrity and honor, is something we should all appreciate no matter what political party someone belongs to.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said Durbin \"has given Illinois a lifetime of principled leadership \u2014 grounded in decency, driven by purpose, and always guided by the people he served,\" and added \"Illinois is stronger because of him and the work he's championed will carry on.\"",
      "Rep. Delia Ramirez, a colleague and fellow Democrat, called Durbin a \"trusted leader, a mentor to many, and a champion for working people in Illinois.\"",
      "\"As he announces his much-deserved retirement, I am feeling thankful for his work and service to the people of Illinois and our nation,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to learn from you and partner with you on so many important issues. As the proud daughter of immigrants, the spouse of a Dreamer, and the Congresswoman of IL-03, I also extend my deepest gratitude for your unwavering commitment to defending our immigrant communities.\"",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson thanked Durbin for \"over 40 years of fighting for the people of Illinois.\" He called him a \"principled and pragmatic leader,\" praised his bipartisanship and his work in the senate.",
      "\"Time and time again, he delivered real results to the working people of Chicago \u2013 investing in our airports and our train stations, defending Dreamers and immigrants, and fighting to end gun violence. He was a champion for young children and early childhood education, and he fought for mental health services for our young people,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Our city, our state, and our country are stronger due to his decades of service.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, who served alongside Durbin in the Senate before his presidential run, also released a statement on the decision, writing, \"As an Illinois voter, I couldn't be prouder that our senator for the last 28 years has been one of the finest in the country. Dick Durbin has always fought the good fight on behalf of working families, and his integrity shines through in everything he does.\"",
      "With Durbin vacating his Senate seat, many prominent Democrats are expected to throw their hat in the ring. CBS News Chicago Political Analyst and former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said it's not impossible that a Republican could win the seat.",
      "\"I think that is a very remote possibility, given the nature of electorate here in Illinois, but I will sound a cautionary note. President Trump did very well not only across Illinois south of I-80, but made inroads in Cook County and DuPage County, and quite frankly did better than expected in the city of Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Lightfoot said she has no plans to run for the seat herself.",
      "\"No, I don't see that happening,\" she said. \"I can tell you private citizen Lightfoot is just fine where I am.\"",
      "Political scientist and professor Stephen Caliendo said there's more than meets the eye behind many of the statements from politicians in response to this announcement today.",
      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",
      "Caliendo said November 2026 really isn't far away, and the race for campaign money has really already started. He believes several members of Congress from Illinois could run, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi holding a huge fundraising lead, with more than $18 million on hand in his campaign fund.",
      "\"He's been hoarding money for some time, and the others have been in a little bit tighter races for their seats, so they've had to spend a little bit more in recent campaigns, but he's been collecting money and certainly the suggestion would be that he was desiring a higher office,\" Caliendo said.",
      "Rep. Lauren Underwood has more than $1 million available in her campaign fund after raising nearly $400,000 between January and March, mostly from individual contributions. Rep. Robin Kelly has more than $2 million I her campaign fund, after raising more than $185,000 between January and March, also nearly all of it from individual contributions.",
      "Stratton also is considered a likely Senate candidate now that Durbin is retiring. She has less than $100,000 in her campaign fund, but can't use it for a Senate race since the money was raised for a state race, not a federal race. However, she could potentially get significant financial backing from Pritzker, a billionaire who hasn't been shy about spending big to support political allies.",

      "President Trump has repeatedly shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos in an effort to link the Maryland man, who was mistakenly deported\u00a0to El Salvador on March 15, to the notorious MS-13 gang.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump again shared a photo of Abrego Garcia's left hand on social media, alleging he \"had 'MS-13' tattooed onto his knuckles.\" The image shows the characters \"M,\" \"S,\" \"1\" and \"3\" digitally added above Abrego Garcia's existing tattoos \u2014 a leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull \u2014 along with labels describing each symbol beneath.",
      "Many people online recognized the labels as digitally added, but some alleged they were designed to appear as part of Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos and accused the Trump administration of trying to mislead the public. The White House has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the image and who added the labels.",
      "The experts and researchers we spoke with acknowledged the tattoos could carry gang-related symbolism, but they said the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership. They also cast doubt on Trump's claims that the marijuana leaf represents an \"M,\" the smiley face \"S,\" the cross \"1\" and the skull \"3.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "He was deported and sent to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, designed to hold the most dangerous gang members, before being moved to another facility as his case attracted widespread attention. As legal efforts to bring him back to the U.S. continue, the Trump administration has cited Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation.",
      "Roberto Lovato, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose memoir chronicled growing up in California during MS-13's early years, said although symbols are \"notoriously difficult to interpret,\" he does not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.",
      "Lovato also said current gang members he has spoken to do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.",
      "Maya Barak, an associate professor of criminal justice studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told CBS News that tattoos such as devil horns, the letters \"M\" and \"S\" and the numbers \"1\" and \"3\" have been used by MS-13 members. The National Gang Center and FBI both cited variations of \"MS,\" \"13\" and devil horns as tattoos associated with MS-13.",
      "A community activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told CBS News he has worked with gang members for more than 25 years and has never seen a series of finger tattoos like Abrego Garcia's linked to MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration's \"border czar\" Tom Homan told ABC News \"you can't ignore a tattoo\" but said people are not being labeled as gang members strictly based on their tattoos.",

      "David Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said identifying someone as a gang member is not a simple process and often requires a multi-pronged approach.",
      "\"I'm not aware of any statutory framework that relies just on tattoos or honestly on any one single aspect,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Lovato agreed that using the tattoos alone as evidence \"would not hold water in a court of law.\"",
      "Kennedy also noted the transient nature of gang membership as another hurdle to identifying active members.",
      "\"Even if we take the tattoos to be indicative of MS-13 membership, that's very often not a permanent status and people stop being involved [in the gang],\" Kennedy said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race for his long-held seat representing Illinois \u2014 and a broader shakeup of Democratic leadership in the Senate.",
      "Durbin, 80, has served since 2005 as the Democratic whip, the second-ranking position in Democratic leadership. First under former Democratic leader Harry Reid and now under Chuck Schumer, the Illinois Democrat has shepherded the caucus through votes, while being a prominent voice on the leadership team for two decades.",
      "After the 2026 elections, the whip position will be up for grabs. And the announcement has spurred whispers about a possible successor.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz's name has been floated as being among the list of Democrats who could take up the mantle. Schatz has represented Hawaii in the Senate since 2012, and currently serves as chief deputy whip. Schatz celebrated Durbin's career in a statement Wednesday, calling the Illinois Democrat a \"mentor and friend.\"",
      "Other members of the Senate Democratic leadership could also vie for the No. 2 post. The caucus elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the No. 3 position in Senate leadership in the last internal elections, along with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to the fourth-ranking post. Both are possible candidates for the whip role, though they each sought the Democratic nomination for the White House in 2020, and could have ambitions beyond the Senate in 2028. The caucus conducts leadership elections behind closed doors before the start of each new Congress.",
      "Durbin's retirement also opens up the coveted top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he's been the top Democrat since 2021. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is widely expected to take his place at the top of the panel.",
      "The Illinois Democrat's announcement of his planned departure comes months after the bruising 2024 election, where Democrats lost power in the White House and the Senate \u2014 leading some members of the party to call for a new generation of leadership to come forward. And a broader shakeup remains possible, especially as questions about Schumer's leadership have continued to swirl, though they've died down considerably in recent weeks.",
      "Facing the threat of a government shutdown in March, Schumer, who's led the caucus since 2017, delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel a GOP-led funding measure to passage after he had initially pledged to oppose it. The move prompted intense frustration among his party, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision, arguing that a shutdown would have been worse than the funding measure for the nation, delivering sole power to the executive branch.",
      "Democrats had widely opposed the measure and expressed frustration with its spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. Some progressives suggested that a shutdown was a better alternative, while others simply took issue with Schumer's changing stance. But in the end, nine Democrats and independents also voted to advance the measure, including Schumer's No. 2, Durbin \u2014 and Schatz.",
      "As attention is now turning to Senate Democratic leadership, Senate Republicans elected a new slate after the 2024 elections, tapping Sen. John Thune to lead the conference after Sen. Mitch McConnell opted to step down after 17 years at the helm.",

      "A 19-year-old U.S. citizen arrested by Customs and Border Protection agents earlier this month in Arizona and briefly prosecuted for illegal entry into the U.S. has intellectual disabilities, his family told CBS News.",
      "Jose Hermosillo was arrested on April 8 by CBP in Tucson and detained for 10 days. His family provided documentation proving his American citizenship, days after being taken into custody, according to court records and Department of Homeland Security assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.",
      "On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security argued his arrest, which has attracted national attention, was a \"direct result of his own actions and statements.\" A DHS spokesperson said Hermosillo approached a Border Patrol agent, said he had entered the U.S. illegally and identified himself as a Mexican citizen.",
      "The department also posted a copy of Hermosillo's sworn statement on X in which Hermosillo responded \"yes\" when asked if he had entered the U.S. illegally. The document shows a child-like signature that reads \"Jose.\"",
      "In a phone interview Tuesday, Hermosillo's parents told CBS News their son suffers from intellectual disabilities, cannot read or write and has trouble speaking. They said he could not have possibly known what he was signing when he was detained.",

He left his girlfriend's relative's home and wandered away during the night, and it was during this walk that Hermosillo was detained by CBP, his parents said.",
      "Details of the arrest remain unclear. The initial April 9 criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Arizona by a Border Patrol agent says Hermosillo was found \"at or near Nogales, Arizona without the proper immigration documents.\" The document referred to Hermosillo as an \"alien\" and charged him with \"improper entry,\" a misdemeanor offense.",
      "But DHS later stated that he was arrested in Tucson. According to court documents, Hermosillo told the judge he was a U.S. citizen during his first appearance. A day later, Hermosillo's U.S. birth certificate was made available to the judge.",
      "When CBS News spoke with Hermosillo, he appeared to be distraught and confused. He said he cried every night at the detention center, describing it as a very cold place filled with sick people who were constantly coughing.",
      "\"When I sleep, I dream that I'm still detained,\" Hermosillo said over the phone in Spanish.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a CBS News request to comment on the allegations by Hermosillo and his parents, including about his intellectual disabilities.",
      "Hermosillo's mother said she was hospitalized after her son was detained because of the stress it caused.",
      "\"I cried every day,\" she said. \"I just wanted them to let him go.\"",

      "The Hermosillo family was able to locate their son at a detention center in Florence, Arizona. On April 17, a Tucson magistrate judge dismissed Hermosillo's criminal case. He was released the next day.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the court-appointed lawyer who represented Hermosillo. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office is looking into his case.",

      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had nearly 20 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 30 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Twelve states and the District of Columbia reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

      "The new data will allow external researchers picked for Kennedy's autism studies to study \"comprehensive\" patient data with \"broad coverage\" of the U.S. population for the first time, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said.",
      "\"The idea of the platform is that the existing data resources are often fragmented and difficult to obtain. The NIH itself will often pay multiple times for the same data resource. Even data resources that are within the federal government are difficult to obtain,\" he said in a presentation to the agency's advisers.",

      "The NIH is also now in talks with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to broaden agreements governing access to their data, Bhattacharya said.",
      "In addition, a new disease registry is being launched to track Americans with autism, which will be integrated into the data. Advocacy groups and experts have called out Kennedy for describing autism as a \"preventable disease,\" which they say is stigmatizing and unfounded.",
      "Between 10 and 20 outside groups of researchers will be given grant funding and access to the records to produce Kennedy's autism studies. Bhattacharya did not give details on how they would be chosen, but said their selection would be \"run through normal NIH processes.\"",
      "Bhattacharya said the research they will back using the data will be \"the highest quality proposals\" that will range \"from basic science to epidemiological approaches, to other more applied approaches\" to treat and manage autism. He also acknowledged autism's wide variation in how it affects people.",
      "\"I recognize, of course, that autism, there's a range of manifestations ranging from highly functioning children to children that are quite severely disabled. And of course the research will account very carefully for that,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:24:36 -0400",
    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A sharply divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "After more than two hours of arguments, the court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who lives in Montgomery County, Maryland, invoked the state's founding and said the county in particular has been a \"beacon\" of religious liberty and tolerance. He told Alan Schoenfeld, who argued for the school board, he was \"surprised\" given that history that \"this is the hill we're going to die on in terms of not respecting religious liberty.\"",
      "\"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt-out of this?\" Justice Samuel Alito asked, noting that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction, such as sexual education or Halloween or Valentine's Day celebrations. \"What is infeasible about doing that?\"",
      "Kavanaugh echoed Alito, saying, \"I'm not understanding why it's not feasible\" for schools to excuse children from instruction that violate their families' religious beliefs.",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "Several of the justices acknowledged that they had read the picture books that were included in the curriculum, and Alito at one point even read from one, \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which discusses gay marriage.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "Eric Baxter, who argued on behalf of the families, told the justices that Montgomery County is an \"extreme outlier\" for declining to allow parents to excuse their children despite their religious objections to the content. He said the instruction featuring the books with LGBTQ-themes was \"clearly indoctrinating\" students.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised the comments, and asked Shoenfeld if they \"suggest a hostility toward religion.\"",
      "Shoenfeld said the remarks were taken out of context but acknowledged they were \"intemperate.\"",
      "Kavanaugh said that as a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he was \"mystified\" by what led the county to eventually end the opt-outs, and said it \"stands alone\" both with the types of books added to the curriculum for young students and in not allowing parents to opt their children out of the instruction.",
      "The school system has said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice. Schoenfeld told the justices that the books sought to \"foster mutual respect in a pluralistic community.\"",
      "It was unclear whether the court would adopt a firm rule that specifies when certain public-school instruction crosses the line from mere exposure to objectionable content into impermissible coercion of students. The justices raised several examples to discern the point at which the right to free exercise of religion would be burdened.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether a parent could request an opt-out for their child whose teacher shows photos from their same-sex wedding or talks about it, or whether a teacher would have to notify a parent if their child had a transgender classmate.",
      "\"This is not just about books,\" she said. \"This is about exposure to people of different sexual orientations and the objection, the sincerely held objection, that children shouldn't be exposed to this?\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Baxter on whether the families were objecting to the \"exposure to the ideas\" portrayed in the books and asked whether they would be pursuing their claim if the storybooks were just on the shelf at the library, rather than incorporated into instruction.",
      "Baxter said his clients would be making the same claim based on their religious beliefs if the picturebooks were just on the shelves.",
      "The school board has warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",

      "More than 5 million borrowers are in default and 4 million more could be in the same position in a few months, which would put nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio in default, according to the Education Department. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their student loan payments.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

      "A town hall hosted by Rep. Byron Donalds turned chaotic Tuesday, with audience members repeatedly interrupting the Florida Republican, leading authorities to remove two people \u2014 the latest raucous town hall dominated by protests against President Trump's administration.",
      "Donalds, a three-term congressman running in next year's Florida gubernatorial race, was asked a litany of often-testy questions, several of which focused on billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Audience members booed or cheered \u2014 and, in some cases, angrily left early \u2014 throughout the almost two-hour event at Estero High School in southwest Florida. Donalds occasionally verbally sparred with the protesters.",
      "Two people appeared to be escorted out by the local sheriff's department after yelling pro-Palestinian sentiments while Donalds answered a question about the Israel-Hamas war. During one incident, Donalds said he would have a protester removed if she kept interrupting. \"Let's have a disagreement. But when you're going to stand and yell and disrespect everybody in this room because you think you're being heard, and let's be clear, you're not,\" he said.",

      "Donalds told reporters after the event he plans on holding more town halls, but he said the interruptions \"got out of hand,\" calling some of them \"rude\" and \"disrespectful\" to other attendees.",
      "\"I could kind of tell from the first question or two what kind of night it was going to be. But you know, that's alright. It's part of the business,\" Donalds told reporters.",
      "The interruptions began quickly. Minutes into the event, a staff member read a pre-submitted question about whether Donalds supports congressional oversight of DOGE. Donalds defended Musk's cost-cutting efforts and said lawmakers are \"letting DOGE complete its work,\" leading some audience members to groan and boo \u2014 though others appeared to cheer Donalds on.",
      "Donalds was also heckled during questions about immigration, gun control measures, DOGE's work in the Social Security Administration, tariffs and diversity programs. He broadly defended Trump administration policies, drawing boos in many cases.",
      "The lawmaker pushed back on protesters in some cases, asking them questions about Biden- and Obama-era programs and arguing critics were not being \"intellectually honest.\" At other points, he encouraged people to \"relax\" and stop heckling: \"You can yell or you can hear,\" he said during an exchange about the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"Is anybody finding this informative?\" Donalds asked the crowd at one point, drawing a mixture of cheers and jeers. \"60-40? That'll work.\"",
      "Donalds is seeking to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A staunch Trump ally, the congressman earned the president's endorsement in February, before Donalds formally launched his gubernatorial campaign.",
      "Monday's event was the latest congressional town hall to get chaotic. Members of both parties have faced adversarial crowds in recent weeks, with protesters often pushing back against Mr. Trump and Musk. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was repeatedly interrupted by protests at a meeting in the Georgia Republican's home district last Tuesday, with police arresting three demonstrators \u2014 two of whom were tased at the scene. That same evening, a town hall hosted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, was also derailed by angry constituents.",
      "Some lawmakers have shied away from hosting in-person events, in some cases shifting to virtual meetings with voters instead. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suggested last month GOP lawmakers should reconsider in-person town halls, saying members of his caucus should communicate with their constituents but \"there are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side sound bites.\"",
      "Donalds said last month he plans to continue holding town halls, brushing off plans to protest the events in an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"Quite frankly, I don't care what they do,\" Donalds said. \"I would tell any Democrat that wants to come out there and astroturf my town hall, bring it, because we're going to talk the truth. We're going to talk about what's really going on. I'm not afraid of you.\"",

      "But attorneys for Abrego Garcia say all of the discovery produced by the Justice Department has been \"nothing of substance,\" and \"consists entirely of public filings from the dockets, copies of Plaintiffs' own discovery requests and correspondence, and two nonsubstantive cover emails transmitting declarations filed in this case.\" Other questions for which Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sought answers have been \"similarly non-responsive,\" they wrote.",
      "The plaintiff's lawyers said that the government \"artificially\" narrowed Xinis' order for discovery \"to avoid complying with its obligations.\"",
      "\"The Government refuses to respond to interrogatories it claims are 'based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador,'\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote, adding that the Justice Department has not provided any information about Abrego Garcia's detention before April 2, although he has been detained in El Salvador since March 15.",
      "They also argued that the government has asserted privilege \"including deliberative process privilege, state secret privilege, and 'governmental privilege' without any foundation for doing so.\"",
      "Justice Department attorneys countered that they have \"put forward a good-faith effort to provide appropriate responses\" to Abrego Garcia's attorneys and added that they plan to file specific privilege claims over information pertaining to Abrego Garcia soon.",
      "The government also said the administration is \"in discussions\" with the Salvadoran government to return Abrego Garcia, but \"any requirement of a more detailed response by the Defendants would be wholly inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions.\"",
      "One detail of Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador may prompt Xinis to seek more information about what the Trump administration knew \u2014 and when \u2014 about his transfer from CECOT, the country's notorious supermax prison, to another detention center.",
      "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia last week, said he was moved from CECOT on April 9 to another lower-security detention facility in El Salvador.",
      "But in court-mandated, daily status updates ordered by Xinis about Abrego Garcia's condition and what the administration is doing to return him, four different officials \u2014 from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the State Department, and Homeland Security \u2014 each stated that Abrego Garcia was being detained at CECOT after that date.",
      "On Monday, the Trump administration confirmed that Abrego Garcia had been moved to a facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, and reported based on conversations with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador that he is \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\"",

      "Elon Musk told Tesla investors he's scaling back his work at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying the amount of time he spends on the task force will \"drop significantly\" starting in May.",
      "As the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiative, DOGE has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But DOGE has also sparked a backlash \u2014 and plenty of lawsuits \u2014 as critics accuse it of accessing voters' private data and cutting programs that are vital to many Americans.",
      "At the same time, Tesla's sales have taken a hit as the automaker's vehicles have increasingly become a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers. The stock has also plunged more than 50% from its most recent high in December, when the shares surged after the presidential election on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said on a conference call to discuss Tesla's earnings.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, jumped 4% to $247.53 after Musk vowed to scale back his work at DOGE.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter earnings, announced Tuesday, fell far short of analyst expectations, with revenue tumbling 9% and profit slumping 71%.",
      "Musk's leaving DOGE might not heal the wounds that Tesla has suffered due to Musk's activities, some analysts say.",
      "\"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that,\" noted Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge in a Tuesday research note. \"On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive.\"",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday announced a \"reorganization\" of the State Department, with plans to make staffing cuts and consolidate domestic offices.",
      "The cuts aren't happening immediately, but a senior State Department official told reporters that Rubio's announcement sets forth a road map for future cuts, and Congress has been notified to set the process in motion. The senior official said State Department undersecretaries for the various bureaus must in about 30 days present a plan on how they will eliminate positions.",
      "Rubio reposted \"X\" posts in which Free Press journalists said the move would entail closing 132 offices, moving 137 offices elsewhere, and directing undersecretaries to reduce personnel by anywhere between 15-17%. Another senior State Department official told reporters on Tuesday that the personnel reduction would be 22%.",
      "Among the agency offices to be cut, according to an \"X\" post Rubio reposted, are those intended to further human rights, advance democracy overseas, counter extremism, and prevent war crimes. Asked during Tuesday's departmental press briefing about the department's office of Global Criminal Justice, which plays a role in investigating war crimes and is missing from the proposed \"reorganization\" chart, Pentagon spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that just \"because it's now folded into another larger bureau, doesn't mean that it's gone or we don't care.\"",
      "Rubio called the State Department in its current form \"bloated, bureaucratic, and unable to perform its essential diplomatic mission in this new era of great power competition.\"",
      "\"Over the past 15 years, the department's footprint has had unprecedented growth and costs have soared,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"But far from seeing a return on investment, taxpayers have seen less effective and efficient diplomacy. The sprawling bureaucracy created a system more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America's core national interests.\"",
      "\"That is why today I am announcing a comprehensive reorganization plan that will bring the Department into the 21st Century,\" Rubio continued. \"This approach will empower the Department from the ground up, from the bureaus to the embassies. Region-specific functions will be consolidated to increase functionality, redundant offices will be removed, and non-statutory programs that are misaligned with America's core national interests will cease to exist.\"",
      "The senior State Department official who briefed reporters stressed this is a \"purely domestic plan\" that \"does not have anything to do with any foreign missions.\"",
      "\"That's not to say that there won't be subsequent decisions on foreign missions, but that's not what this is,\" the official said.",
      "According to Rubio's notification to Congress, the State Department would formally assume responsibility for remaining humanitarian assistance programming, and most remaining USAID functions would be absorbed by the State Department.",
      "The senior State Department official said these changes are an \"attempt to go back to the traditional roots of the State Department, which are the primacy of the regional bureaus and of our foreign missions.\"",
      "The changes to the State Department come amid the Trump administration's efforts to shutter most of USAID.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "FBI directors typically fly on government jets, but they're encouraged to limit personal travel.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Kash Patel emerged as a vocal critic of then-FBI Director Christopher Wray for his use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel.",
      "The FBI should \"ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country,\" Patel said during his \"Kash's Corner\" podcast in 2023.",
      "Now, Patel himself is the director, and questions have begun circulating inside the FBI about the degree to which Patel is using governmental airplanes for his personal travels.",
      "The FBI declined to share Patel's flight schedule and would not confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations where he later appeared. During the first weekend in April, for instance, a Boeing 757 owned by the Department of Justice made two round trip flights from Washington to New York.",
      "On Saturday, April 5, the narrow-body jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel made an appearance at a charity hockey event hosted by the FBI. The next day, the jet was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel resurfaced in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky and watched Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",
      "The New York Times first reported on Patel's use of FBI aircraft on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear if Patel was on these flights \u2014 and if he was, whether they were purely personal, work related, or both. But on Monday, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee told CBS News in a statement that he wants the answer to those questions.",
      "\"The Judiciary Committee must investigate Director Patel's apparent misuse of taxpayer dollars,\" said U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. \"The American people expect an FBI Director who focuses on the security and safety of the nation, not someone wrapped up in the trappings of the spotlight.\"",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That enables them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel. And it gives the director the ability to move quickly in an emergency.",
      "If the travel is personal, the director must reimburse the government the cost of a commercial coach airfare. When traveling for personal reasons, the director may bring family or friends, but guest travel must be reimbursed to the government as well. Friends or family members are never allowed to fly on FBI aircraft unaccompanied by the director. It is unclear whether Patel has brought friends or family aboard government jets.",
      "But Durbin said the use of the plane still has limits and questioned whether the use of the aircraft cut against the Trump administration's professed commitment to rooting out government waste.",
      "Patel's use of Gulfstream jets operated by the FBI appears to extend to his frequent trips to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, who is a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by FlightRadar24, including a weekend dash to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 14.",
      "It is unclear if he was aboard on Feb. 24, when one of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets flew from Manassas, Virginia, where the plane is based, to Nashville, stayed on the ground for an hour and 27 minutes before returning to Manassas.",
      "On some occasions, Patel may have traveled for both pleasure and business. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington to Nashville. That day, Patel attended a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement officials in Tennessee, and also visited the FBI field office in Nashville. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether he saw Alexis Wilkins, his girlfriend, while he was there.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the FBI said it \"does not comment on travel arrangements for security purposes. All ethical guidelines are followed rigorously.\"",
      "Some bureau veterans told CBS News they have been troubled by the frequent use of government aircraft by FBI executives, making the aircraft less available to support operations in line with the primary mission of investigating crimes, chasing spies and preventing terrorist attacks.",
      "\"Those aircraft have been procured or leased specifically to support operational needs,\" said Christopher O'Leary, a former senior counterterrorism official at the FBI who has used the planes dozens of times for sensitive missions and critical response. \"The concern is that the routine use of them by the director and deputy director for personal travel could take a critical resource offline when they are sometimes needed at a moment's notice.\"",
      "O'Leary and others said they also worry that the use of the planes sets the wrong tone.",
      "\"It's a bad leadership example,\" he told CBS News. \"All agents are provided an FBI vehicle, and they cannot be used for personal use.\u00a0 They can only be used for going to and from work, for official duties or to respond to a crisis and that is strictly enforced.\"",
      "Congressional watchdog advised limits on personal jet travel",
      "In 2013, the Government Accountability Office probed the Justice Department's and the FBI's use of the FBI G5 jets for \"non-mission purposes.\" The report that followed laid out how often and for what reasons the planes were used by the attorney general and the FBI director, the costs associated with the flights and the rules and regulations governing them. At the time, the GAO did not find any specific instances of wrongdoing, although it did emphasize the importance of officials being responsible stewards of taxpayer funds when using the planes.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the congressional watchdog agency did its review remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do, and we haven't updated our 2013 report,\" Mauer said in an interview.\u00a0 \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't necessarily mean you should.\"",
      "Maurer noted that government officials should not abuse their privileges at the expense of the taxpayer.",
      "\"Using government aircraft, as FBI Directors are required to do for security reasons, costs significantly more than commercial flights. I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the Director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes.\"",
      "Past FBI directors faced scrutiny",
      "During the years that Wray ran the FBI, his personal use of the jet became a touchstone for conservative critics. Wray occasionally flew from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. He drew criticism from Republicans in Congress and some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-minute flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where it maintains a hangar.",
      "FBI whistleblower Steven Friend, a close ally of Patel's who was suspended by the bureau over concerns that his views on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol affected his work, criticized Wray in more than a dozen social media posts for his use of the jets. \"Chris Wray abuses his\u00a0 @FBI jet privileges because he doesn't like to sit in traffic,\" Friend wrote in a Dec. 14, 2023, tweet.",
      "Wray was also raked over the coals by Republican lawmakers for cutting short a Senate oversight hearing in 2023 to fly on an FBI aircraft to a family vacation in the Adirondacks. (Wray at the time pointed out that he had negotiated the length of the hearing with committee staff.) The chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, later questioned Wray's use of the FBI jets and whether it amounted to an abuse of taxpayer money, a suggestion that Wray rejected, noting that he was a \"required use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Grassley said the senator is \"still waiting on the FBI\" for records regarding Wray's use of the jets and criticized Democrats and the media, claiming they never showed \"any interest in scrutinizing FBI Directors' travel logs until Kash Patel came on the scene.\" Grassley's office did not respond to a question about whether the senator would continue his oversight of FBI directors' government jet travel while Patel is director.",
      "FBI directors have also at times been sensitive about the potential misuses of the FBI's fleet. In at least one case, a former FBI director went to extraordinary lengths to save the taxpayer money for his air travel.",
      "Soon after he became FBI director in 2013, James Comey traveled back and forth to Connecticut where his family was still living. At the time, Washington was in the midst of a heated budget battle with the possibility that government workers would be furloughed and have their paychecks withheld. So, according to two former law enforcement officials, Comey asked President Barack Obama for a special dispensation from the \"required use\" rule so that he could fly commercial at a much lower cost to the government.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "While Zeldin says the policy changes won't have adverse health effects, The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, found otherwise. They analyzed EPA data of 12 of the 31 proposed rollbacks and estimate that air pollution would increase as a result of the deregulation that would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths and cause more than 10,000 asthma attacks every day in America.",
      "Already, the EPA has provided exemptions to 47 power plants operators from complying with stricter mercury and air toxin standards that are due to go into effect in 2027. Power plants in 23 states are on the list and several are coal plants that emit fine particulate matter, which pose the greatest risk to health. This comes after the EPA announced it would accept emails from companies and industries looking to avoid environmental regulations if they could prove it was in the best interest of national security.",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

      "A showdown in federal court in Denver could help shape the future legal landscape surrounding deportations nationwide.",
      "A high-stakes hearing concluded Monday morning  in a case filed by immigrants' rights groups against the Trump administration. Attorneys for the administration argued that people facing deportation should only be allotted 24 hours' notice to be able to fight their deportation order in court, but attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argued that 24 hours isn't \"reasonable,\" as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"The government wants to give as little notice as possible so they can pull people out of the country without a judge reviewing it,\" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, told CBS News Colorado outside the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse   on Monday.",
      "\"The idea that 24 hours is sufficient for someone who's detained at the Aurora detention facility, who likely doesn't speak English, who may not have a high level of education, who doesn't have a lawyer, who doesn't have access to a phone -- the idea that that person can file a, quote, 'writ of habeas corpus' in 24 hours is preposterous,\" he continued.",
      "Macdonald went on to say that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights\u00a0in court after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration, echoing what a U.S. Appeals Court judge said in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Charlotte Sweeney, U.S. District judge for the District of Colorado, said on Monday she wouldn't rule on the case for 24 hours. During that hearing, attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network said 11 people have been deported from Colorado to El Salvador and about 85% of people being held in the Aurora ICE Processing Center -- which has 1,532 beds -- have not yet been able to retain legal counsel, which those groups argue is a violation of their due process rights.",
      "Court records show the hearing lasted just over an hour. In addition to President Trump, the defendants named in the case include U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ICE Denver Field Office Director Robert Gaudian, and Dawn Ceja, warden of the ICE Processing Center in Aurora.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court issued a rare weekend ruling\u00a0temporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport more Venezuelan migrants from a Texas detention facility under a seldom-used wartime law passed in 1798, the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act, allowing the executive branch to detain or deport noncitizens it deems \"dangerous,\" particularly those administration officials say are part of the gang Tren de Aragua. Last month, the administration used the law to send more than 200 people to a\u00a0prison in El Salvador.",
      "The Supreme Court's weekend ruling came as mass protests continued across the country, including in Colorado, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration policies. The administration is urging the court to reconsider its decision blocking the deportations.",
      "Now, El Salvador's president has proposed exchanging the deported migrants for political prisoners held in Venezuela.",
      "In Denver, a federal court recently barred the removal of any noncitizens within Colorado\u00a0who are or will be subject to the Alien Enemies Act. Some of those previously deported from Colorado have already been sent to the El Salvador prison, according to their attorneys.",
      "At issue is what kind of legal rights migrants have to challenge the government's allegations before they are removed from the U.S.",
      "Trump has said the United States is facing an \"invasion\" by the Tren de Aragua gang and that he has the authority to use the 1798 law. The act was last invoked during World War II, including in Colorado, to hold Japanese Americans at internment camps, including Camp Amache.",
      "Prior to World War II, the act had only been used against the Central Powers during World War I and against the British during the War of 1812.",
      "\"If you think of internment camps during World War II in the United States, that's the kind of framework that we're looking at in terms of how this law has been used in the past,\" Laura Lunn, an immigrant advocacy lawyer with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said.",
      "The legal battle has triggered a series of emergency filings over the weekend after the Supreme Court bumped a case out of U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., saying it needed to be filed in Texas and other states from which people are being deported.",
      "Asked about why this case matters, Macdonald said, \"if the government can remove these folks without due process, it erodes civil liberties for every one of us, and they could be next. We could be next. If the government is able to dispense with due process, it's a risk for liberty for all of us.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:52:31 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump again lashed out at Jerome Powell, calling him a \"major loser\" and urging the Fed Chair to immediately cut interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post\u00a0on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"",
      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",
      "Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.",
      "\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really \u2014 I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"",
      "\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.",

Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",

From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",

      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",

      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",

I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",
      "When they refused, Moczadlo immediately ended the interview. He explained that the software the scammer was using didn't seem sophisticated, so blocking the person's face with their hand would likely \"break\" the deepfake face filter.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes a hacker to find a hacker,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",

      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",
      "The new executive orders come as the president has singled out Harvard University. His administration has frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard, demanded sweeping changes to school policies and suggested it should lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",
      "The Trump administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on \"woke ideology\" instead of results, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. The executive order Mr. Trump signed affects law schools and graduate programs as well.",
      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. Harvard told CBS News in a statement it has filed foreign gift reporting reports \"for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.\"",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

      "A new report on air quality across the United States offered a cloudy prognosis on the long-term health of about 156 million residents who live in areas that received an \"F\" in smog and soot pollution.",
      "The American Lung Association's annual State of the Air report, which looked at the latest air quality data from 2021 to 2023, concluded that 25 million more people are breathing \"unhealthy levels of air pollution\" compared to last year. According to the report, around 46% of people in the U.S. live in an area that received a failing grade in at least one of the three measures that were studied: short-term particle pollution, year-round particle pollution and ozone pollution.",
      "Since\u00a0the Clean Air Act\u00a0was signed into law in 1970, emissions of the six most common air pollutants have fallen by 78%, according to the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 but recent analyses show air pollution has been on the rise in recent years.",
      "\"Since the act passed, the air pollution has gone down overall,\" Laura Kate Bender, an assistant vice president at the American Lung Association, told CBS News. \"The challenge is that over the last few years, we're starting to see it tick back up again and that's because of climate change, in part. Climate change is making some of those conditions for wildfires and extreme heat that drive ozone pollution worse for a lot of the country.\"",
      "The most polluted and cleanest U.S. cities",
      "For the sixth year in a row, Bakersfield, California, remained the city with the worst year-round particle pollution and short-term particle pollution, according to the report. The industrial city \u2014 known for agriculture, mining and oil refineries \u2014 also ranked third for worst high ozone days.",
      "Conversely, the city ranked first in the American Lung Association's top 25 cleanest U.S. cities by year-round particle is Casper, Wyoming, which has less than 80,000 residents compared to Bakersfield's nearly 914,000 population.",
      "Here's the American Lung Association's latest list of the top 10 cities with the worst year-round particle pollution:",

      "Climate change and regulations roll back",
      "Prior years of reporting found that the worst of the nation's air quality was concentrated in western states, but the new report released Wednesday said the concentration of poor air has started to shift east.",
      "Extreme heat, lack of precipitation and wildfires associated with climate change continue to play a growing part in worsening the air quality across the U.S. and exposing a growing proportion of Americans to pollutants, the report said. It cited a\u00a02023 deadly heat wave\u00a0and smoke from\u00a0Canada's worst wildfire season as contributors to worsened levels of air pollution in central and eastern states.",
      "\"I think we knew that the wildfire smoke would have an impact on air quality in the United States,\" Kevin Stewart, the American Lung Association's environmental health director, told CBS Philadelphia. \"I think we were surprised at the Lung Association by how strong the effect was, especially in the northeastern quadrant of the continental United States.\"",
      "Last month, the EPA announced it will roll back or change 31 environmental rules and regulations, including revisions of national air quality standards for particulate matter, emission standards for industrial air pollutants and regulations restricting vehicle emissions. The proposed cuts are putting more than five decades of progress at risk, Kate Bender said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we see that everything that makes our air quality better is at risk,\" she said. \"The EPA is at risk \u2014 the agency that is protecting our health \u2014 through staff cuts, funding cuts. The regulations that have cleaned up our air over time are at risk of being cut. If we see all those cuts become reality, it's gonna have a real impact on people's health by making the air they breathe dirtier.\"",
      "EPA Administrator\u00a0Lee Zeldin\u00a0argued that the deregulation will instead drive \"a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.\"",
      "Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee that Trump administration deregulations won't have adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "What are the health effects of air pollution?",
      "Both ozone and particle pollution can cause a wide range of health problems that lead to premature death, according to the American Lung Association. The effects of bad air quality have been extensively studied and shown to cause asthma and heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and impaired cognitive function later in life.",
      "\"The air pollutants covered in this report are widespread and can impact anyone's health,\" Kezia Ofosu Atta, advocacy director for the Lung Association in Michigan, told CBS Detroit.",
      "\"This air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick and unable to work, and leading to low birth weight in babies,\" Ofosu Atta said, who urged lawmakers to take action to improve the city's air, which ranked sixth in the nation for year-round pollution.",
      "The American Lung Association's report noted that Black people are more like to suffer the serious health effects of air pollution due to the long history of systemic racism in the U.S., including segregation and decision-makers finding it easier to place sources of pollution such as power plants, industrial facilities, landfills and highways in economically disadvantaged communities of color.",

      "People under 20 were the least likely to lose money to a scam, reporting about $22.5 million in losses in around 18,000 complaints in 2024.",
      "Eighty-three percent of losses involved the use of the internet or other technology, the FBI said.",
      "Investment scams were the top cause of loss, raking in more than $6.5 billion, the FBI said. Compromised business emails and tech support scams led to over $2.7 billion and more than $1.4 billion in losses, respectively, while personal data breaches were responsible for over $1.4 billion in losses.",

      "Bessent, who delivered the keynote address at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C., today, said that the Trump administration wants the U.S. economy to rebalance toward more manufacturing, while urging China to shift away from what he called \"export-led manufacturing growth.\"",
      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change \u2014 because we need rebalancing too,\" Bessent said in the speech.",
      "Beijing's export-reliant economic model is \"unsustainable\" and harms both China and the rest of the world, Bessent added. At the same time, the Treasury chief maintained that \"America First does not mean America alone,\" a comment that comes after the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration is considering slashing tariffs on China to de-escalate tensions between the two largest global economies.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio that can be used to prepare for television appearances, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, according to two of the sources, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures.",
      "\"Changes and upgrades to the Pentagon Briefing Room are nothing new and routinely happen during changes in an administration,\" a Defense Department spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The renovation that was initially planned was estimated to cost more than $40,000, but the ideas were scaled back, sources said.",
      "After CBS News published its report, the defense secretary responded in a post on X, \"Totally fake story. No 'orders' and no 'makeup.'\"",
      "Hegseth, before becoming defense secretary, was a morning show co-host on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\" Since his nomination, he has vowed to emphasize improvements in the armed forces' warfighting abilities and military readiness.",

      "The table was removed and a new chair and large mirror with makeup lighting was installed, another source said.",
      "Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said.",
      "The Defense Department spokesperson said the green room will be available to senior leaders and VIPs prior to press engagements.",
      "The new items, including a director's chair, came from existing inventories, the spokesperson said. A new countertop was constructed by facilities services staff.",

      "Hegseth hasn't used the press room to brief reporters. But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",
      "Hegseth claims he did not disclose classified information in either of the chat groups. The Defense Department acting inspector general is reviewing his disclosures.",
      "\"We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on the president's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon, and I'm proud of it,\" Hegseth said Tuesday on Fox.",
      "The Pentagon restricted access to its briefing room on Feb. 21, barring reporters unless officials were speaking. Previously, press could use the room, one of the few places they could connect to Wi-Fi in the secure building, to file stories and to conduct on-camera reports.",

      "Extreme heat caused by emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies cost an estimated $28 trillion between 1991 and 2020, according to researchers at Dartmouth College.",
      "Their study, which was published Wednesday in \"Nature,\" presents a peer-reviewed method for tying emissions to specific climate harms. Their goal is to help hold companies liable for the cost of extreme weather, similar to holding the tobacco industry liable for lung cancer cases or pharmaceutical companies liable for the opioid crisis.",
      "The research firm Zero Carbon Analytics counts 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage, with more than half of them in the United States.",
      "\"We argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed,\" wrote the study's authors, Christopher Callahan, who received his PhD from Dartmouth College, and Justin Mankin, a Dartmouth Department of Geography professor.",
      "5 top emitting companies",
      "About a third of the total cost was attributed to five companies, which can be tied to more than $9 trillion in climate damage, according to the study.",
      "These are the top-emitting companies and the dollar amount the researchers estimate they are responsible for:",
      "Saudi Aramco: $2.05\u2009 trillionGazprom: $2 \u2009trillionChevron:\u00a0 $1.98\u2009 trillion\u00a0ExxonMobil:\u00a0 $1.91 trillionBP: $1.45 \u2009trillion",

      "ExxonMobil:\u00a0 $1.91 trillion",
      "BP: $1.45 \u2009trillion",
      "The researchers figured that every 1% of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused $502 billion in damage from heat alone, which doesn't include the costs incurred by other extreme weather such as hurricanes, droughts and floods. Emissions data is taken from the public Carbon Majors database, they said.",
      "They used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for Earth's global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that company's emissions.",
      "Using this approach, they determined that pollution from Chevron, for example, has raised the Earth's temperature by .045 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "The researchers also calculated how much each company's pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output.",
      "This system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, to climate change.",
      "Mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, \"Who's to say that it's my molecule of CO2 that's contributed to these damages versus any other one?\" He said the study \"really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesn't exist anymore scientifically. We can actually trace harms back to major emitters.\"",
      "Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"All methods they use are quite robust,\" said Imperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads World Weather Attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. She didn't take part in the study.",
      "\"It would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. As with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not,\" Otto said. So far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing \"how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence\" is can change that, she said.",
      "The research is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that Callahan and Mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist who wasn't involved in the study.",

      "Durbin, 80, expressed his gratitude to the people of Illinois for electing him to the Senate for so many years, and said he was honored by the responsibility bestowed on him.",
      "\"Right now the challenges facing our country are historic and unprecedented,\" he continued. \"The threats to our democracy and our way of life are very real, and I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.\"",
      "Durbin called his fellow Illinois senator, Tammy Duckworth, a \"trusted friend and effective leader,\" and said she will be a \"real asset\" to the state and the nation as Illinois' next senior senator.",
      "Durbin is the senior senator for Illinois. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, filling the seat left vacant by longtime Sen. Paul Simon.",
      "He is the 5th most senior member of the Senate, and also serves at the Senate Democratic Whip, the second-highest ranking position for the party in the Senate. He was first elected to this leadership post by Senate Democrats in 2005, and has been reelected to it every two years since.",
      "Durbin is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. His retirement is expected to serve as the impetus for a broader shakeup of the Democratic Senate leadership.",
      "He introduced the Dream Act, which would give undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and grew up here a path to citizenship, in 2001 alongside Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). He was also a force behind the establishment of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival Program, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama in 2012.",
      "He also championed the First Step Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2018, a bipartisan criminal justice bill that reformed sentencing laws and provided more opportunities for incarcerated people to re-enter society upon their release.",
      "Durbin and his wife, Loretta Schaefer Durbin, live in Springfield, Illinois. He has three children \u2013 Paul, Jennifer and Christine, his oldest daughter who died in 2008 from complications from a congenital heart condition.",
      "While no one has officially signaled their intentions to toss their names into the ring for Durbin's seat, some of the Illinois politicians most often talked about as a potential replacements include 14th District U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and 8th District U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi.",
      "Colleagues pay tribute to Durbin's career",
      "A number of legislators took time Wednesday morning to share tributes to Durbin's long career in politics.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a fellow Democrat, praised Durbin \"for his exemplary career of public service as well as the profound and lasting positive impact he's had on Illinois families and our nation.\" He added:",
      "\"Known for his legendary work ethic, Senator Durbin has led the fight to expand access to affordable health care, invest in our state's infrastructure, tackle gun violence, defend Dreamers, improve public health, protect working families, and more. His expert leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee ensured the confirmation of a record 235 federal judges, shaping the courts and securing our most fundamental American rights for many years to come.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Decatur, Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker honored Durbin, saying, \"Let's all recognize someone serving us for decades in Washington D.C., representing the state of Illinois with enormous integrity and honor, is something we should all appreciate no matter what political party someone belongs to.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said Durbin \"has given Illinois a lifetime of principled leadership \u2014 grounded in decency, driven by purpose, and always guided by the people he served,\" and added \"Illinois is stronger because of him and the work he's championed will carry on.\"",
      "Rep. Delia Ramirez, a colleague and fellow Democrat, called Durbin a \"trusted leader, a mentor to many, and a champion for working people in Illinois.\"",
      "\"As he announces his much-deserved retirement, I am feeling thankful for his work and service to the people of Illinois and our nation,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to learn from you and partner with you on so many important issues. As the proud daughter of immigrants, the spouse of a Dreamer, and the Congresswoman of IL-03, I also extend my deepest gratitude for your unwavering commitment to defending our immigrant communities.\"",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson thanked Durbin for \"over 40 years of fighting for the people of Illinois.\" He called him a \"principled and pragmatic leader,\" praised his bipartisanship and his work in the senate.",
      "\"Time and time again, he delivered real results to the working people of Chicago \u2013 investing in our airports and our train stations, defending Dreamers and immigrants, and fighting to end gun violence. He was a champion for young children and early childhood education, and he fought for mental health services for our young people,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Our city, our state, and our country are stronger due to his decades of service.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, who served alongside Durbin in the Senate before his presidential run, also released a statement on the decision, writing, \"As an Illinois voter, I couldn't be prouder that our senator for the last 28 years has been one of the finest in the country. Dick Durbin has always fought the good fight on behalf of working families, and his integrity shines through in everything he does.\"",
      "With Durbin vacating his Senate seat, many prominent Democrats are expected to throw their hat in the ring. CBS News Chicago Political Analyst and former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said it's not impossible that a Republican could win the seat.",
      "\"I think that is a very remote possibility, given the nature of electorate here in Illinois, but I will sound a cautionary note. President Trump did very well not only across Illinois south of I-80, but made inroads in Cook County and DuPage County, and quite frankly did better than expected in the city of Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Lightfoot said she has no plans to run for the seat herself.",
      "\"No, I don't see that happening,\" she said. \"I can tell you private citizen Lightfoot is just fine where I am.\"",
      "Political scientist and professor Stephen Caliendo said there's more than meets the eye behind many of the statements from politicians in response to this announcement today.",
      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",
      "Caliendo said November 2026 really isn't far away, and the race for campaign money has really already started. He believes several members of Congress from Illinois could run, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi holding a huge fundraising lead, with more than $18 million on hand in his campaign fund.",
      "\"He's been hoarding money for some time, and the others have been in a little bit tighter races for their seats, so they've had to spend a little bit more in recent campaigns, but he's been collecting money and certainly the suggestion would be that he was desiring a higher office,\" Caliendo said.",
      "Rep. Lauren Underwood has more than $1 million available in her campaign fund after raising nearly $400,000 between January and March, mostly from individual contributions. Rep. Robin Kelly has more than $2 million I her campaign fund, after raising more than $185,000 between January and March, also nearly all of it from individual contributions.",
      "Stratton also is considered a likely Senate candidate now that Durbin is retiring. She has less than $100,000 in her campaign fund, but can't use it for a Senate race since the money was raised for a state race, not a federal race. However, she could potentially get significant financial backing from Pritzker, a billionaire who hasn't been shy about spending big to support political allies.",

      "On Monday, Mr. Trump again shared a photo of Abrego Garcia's left hand on social media, alleging he \"had 'MS-13' tattooed onto his knuckles.\" The image shows the characters \"M,\" \"S,\" \"1\" and \"3\" digitally added above Abrego Garcia's existing tattoos \u2014 a leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull \u2014 along with labels describing each symbol beneath.",
      "Many people online recognized the labels as digitally added, but some alleged they were designed to appear as part of Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos and accused the Trump administration of trying to mislead the public. The White House has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the image and who added the labels.",
      "The experts and researchers we spoke with acknowledged the tattoos could carry gang-related symbolism, but they said the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership. They also cast doubt on Trump's claims that the marijuana leaf represents an \"M,\" the smiley face \"S,\" the cross \"1\" and the skull \"3.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "He was deported and sent to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, designed to hold the most dangerous gang members, before being moved to another facility as his case attracted widespread attention. As legal efforts to bring him back to the U.S. continue, the Trump administration has cited Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation.",
      "Roberto Lovato, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose memoir chronicled growing up in California during MS-13's early years, said although symbols are \"notoriously difficult to interpret,\" he does not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.",
      "Lovato also said current gang members he has spoken to do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.",
      "Maya Barak, an associate professor of criminal justice studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told CBS News that tattoos such as devil horns, the letters \"M\" and \"S\" and the numbers \"1\" and \"3\" have been used by MS-13 members. The National Gang Center and FBI both cited variations of \"MS,\" \"13\" and devil horns as tattoos associated with MS-13.",
      "A community activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told CBS News he has worked with gang members for more than 25 years and has never seen a series of finger tattoos like Abrego Garcia's linked to MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration's \"border czar\" Tom Homan told ABC News \"you can't ignore a tattoo\" but said people are not being labeled as gang members strictly based on their tattoos.",
      "\"It's based on a lot of other things, but tattoos, one of many. But no one's removed just because of a tattoo,\" Homan said on ABC's \"This Week.\"",
      "Difficulties accurately identifying gang members",
      "Days before Mr. Trump shared the photo, other X accounts posted the same interpretation of Abrego Garcia's tattoos, garnering hundreds of thousands of views.",
      "David Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said identifying someone as a gang member is not a simple process and often requires a multi-pronged approach.",
      "\"I'm not aware of any statutory framework that relies just on tattoos or honestly on any one single aspect,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Lovato agreed that using the tattoos alone as evidence \"would not hold water in a court of law.\"",
      "Kennedy also noted the transient nature of gang membership as another hurdle to identifying active members.",
      "\"Even if we take the tattoos to be indicative of MS-13 membership, that's very often not a permanent status and people stop being involved [in the gang],\" Kennedy said.",
      "Maya Barak co-authored a report that highlighted the potential for mislabeling people as MS-13 members based on their perceived race or immigration status as well as their style of dress and tattoos.",
      "Multiple experts pointed out that some symbols used by gangs \u2014 such as devils or skulls \u2014 are also frequently used by the general population.",

      "NOAA Ocean Exploration sent a remotely operated camera inside the USS Yorktown on April 19 and 20, the agency said in a news release. The 806-foot-long aircraft carrier, nicknamed the \"Fighting Lady,\" played a huge role in the United States' Pacific campaign during World War II before it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine during the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The mission was the first to focus on the ship's hanger deck.",
      "The most surprising find was the first-ever discovery of underwater aircraft that had flown on the Midway battlefield, NOAA said. Previous missions have investigated ships that took part in the battle, but the dive on April 20 found aircraft that had engaged in the air and sea battle.",
      "At least three Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers were found on the hanger deck. One plane was still fully armed, with a bomb secured in its release cradle. This plane was likely part of a reserve force, NOAA said.",
      "The other two planes were battle-damaged. They are believed to be part of the USS Enterprise's bombing squadron, which landed aboard the USS Yorktown after a successful attack on a Japanese carrier ship. Records show that the badly damaged airplanes were moved to the hangar deck and set ablaze when three enemy bombs struck the USS Yorktown, NOAA said. Research to confirm the planes is ongoing.",
      "The remotely operated camera also identified multiple plane wings in the hangar deck. These were likely spare parts, NOAA said. One of the plane wings had first been imaged during a 2023 expedition.",
      "Another discovery showcased in the new images is a mural hand-painted inside one of the ship's elevator shafts.",
      "The mural, \"A Chart of the Cruises of the USS Yorktown,\" had been partially visible in historic photographs taken before the ship's sinking, but has not been seen since. The 42-foot by 12-foot mural tracks the Yorktown's trips across the world.",

It serves as a resting place for hundreds of servicemen who were aboard the ship when it sank. It has been the site of multiple remotely operated vehicle dives since it was discovered and documented in 1998.",

Three hundred and sixty-two U.S. troops died, according to the\u00a0National WWII Museum, and the vast majority of the casualties were Japanese service members.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race for his long-held seat representing Illinois \u2014 and a broader shakeup of Democratic leadership in the Senate.",
      "Durbin, 80, has served since 2005 as the Democratic whip, the second-ranking position in Democratic leadership. First under former Democratic leader Harry Reid and now under Chuck Schumer, the Illinois Democrat has shepherded the caucus through votes, while being a prominent voice on the leadership team for two decades.",
      "After the 2026 elections, the whip position will be up for grabs. And the announcement has spurred whispers about a possible successor.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz's name has been floated as being among the list of Democrats who could take up the mantle. Schatz has represented Hawaii in the Senate since 2012, and currently serves as chief deputy whip. Schatz celebrated Durbin's career in a statement Wednesday, calling the Illinois Democrat a \"mentor and friend.\"",
      "Other members of the Senate Democratic leadership could also vie for the No. 2 post. The caucus elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the No. 3 position in Senate leadership in the last internal elections, along with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to the fourth-ranking post. Both are possible candidates for the whip role, though they each sought the Democratic nomination for the White House in 2020, and could have ambitions beyond the Senate in 2028. The caucus conducts leadership elections behind closed doors before the start of each new Congress.",
      "Durbin's retirement also opens up the coveted top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he's been the top Democrat since 2021. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is widely expected to take his place at the top of the panel.",
      "The Illinois Democrat's announcement of his planned departure comes months after the bruising 2024 election, where Democrats lost power in the White House and the Senate \u2014 leading some members of the party to call for a new generation of leadership to come forward. And a broader shakeup remains possible, especially as questions about Schumer's leadership have continued to swirl, though they've died down considerably in recent weeks.",
      "Facing the threat of a government shutdown in March, Schumer, who's led the caucus since 2017, delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel a GOP-led funding measure to passage after he had initially pledged to oppose it. The move prompted intense frustration among his party, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision, arguing that a shutdown would have been worse than the funding measure for the nation, delivering sole power to the executive branch.",
      "Democrats had widely opposed the measure and expressed frustration with its spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. Some progressives suggested that a shutdown was a better alternative, while others simply took issue with Schumer's changing stance. But in the end, nine Democrats and independents also voted to advance the measure, including Schumer's No. 2, Durbin \u2014 and Schatz.",
      "As attention is now turning to Senate Democratic leadership, Senate Republicans elected a new slate after the 2024 elections, tapping Sen. John Thune to lead the conference after Sen. Mitch McConnell opted to step down after 17 years at the helm.",

When Detective Tom Forest from the Cyber Crime Unit examined the computer's hard drive, it revealed peculiar web searches and online activity he considered notable to the investigation. The online activity began about three months before Amy Fanion's death, around the time Brian Fanion and Knowles' friendship turned flirtatious.",
      "\"\u2026 it's only when this affair starts up \u2026 that all of these incriminating searches start to appear,\" Hampden County Assistant District Attorney Mary Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The first of these inquiries was related to common household poisons. On the morning of Feb. 12, Brian Fanion searched \"household poisons,\" \"dangerous sources of radiation,\" \"worst sources of radiation\" and \"common prescription overdoses.\" He also visited web pages titled, \"9 Surprising Sources of Radiation in Your Home;\" \"Carbon Monoxide: The Invisible Killer;\" \"Common and dangerous poisons;\" \"16 Common Household Items That Could Kill You;\" \"What Over-the-Counter Medications Can You Overdose From?;\" \"Which Drug Causes the Most Deaths Each Year?\" and, finally, \"Prescription Drugs Linked to Most Fatal Overdoses.\"",
      "At trial, Brian Fanion's defense attorney Jeffrey Brown argued that the Fanions were preparing to have a young niece stay with them and that some of the websites were related to potential hazards their 200-year-old house might pose.",
      "At the beginning of March 2018, Fanion repeatedly Googled his potential lover, Cori Knowles. On April 2, as things heated up between Fanion and Knowles, he began questioning the nuances of affairs, searching \"can you have an affair without sex.\"",
      "Two weeks later, on April 17, Fanion began researching divorce laws in Massachusetts. Several web pages he visited were related to pension rights after divorce. Fanion was planning for his upcoming retirement, and according to Knowles in an interview with police, he feared losing part of his pension if he were to divorce his wife. The following day, Brian Fanion's inquiries into infidelity resumed, visiting web pages titled \"My perfect affair \u2013 how I'm getting away with it\" and \"Emotional Infidelity: Worse Than A Sexual Affair?\"",
      "Eleven days before Amy Fanion died, on April 27, Brian Fanion searched \"gsr testing\" on his work computer. That morning between 9:22 and 9:38 a.m., Brian Fanion visited five web pages related to gunshot residue. Among those web pages were \"Gunshot Residue Collection: The Decisions that Make or Break a Case\" and a news report on YouTube called \"What gunshot residue tests tell us.\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours\" this had nothing to do with Brian Fanion's work at the Westfield Police Department.",
      "\"He wasn't assigned to any active investigations in April and May of 2018 \u2026 that would necessitate looking up gunshot residue,\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\" \"Nobody in the Westfield Police Department does gunshot residue testing.\"",
      "On May 7, 2018, the day before Amy Fanion was shot dead, Fanion repeatedly searched how to remove frequent contacts from his phone. At his trial, Fanion's defense argued that he was in the process of getting a new phone and wanted to know how to erase data from his current one. Sandstrom prosecuted the case.",
      "\"Now, the defendant suggests that he did these searches because he's in the process of getting a new phone right before his wife's demise,\" Sandstrom told the jury. \"But he's not looking to delete all data off of his phone \u2026 he's searching how to delete the frequently contacted list because he doesn't want evidence of his relationship with Corrine being discovered by the state police.\"",
      "Fanion's trial for the murder of Amy Fanion began on Feb. 23, 2023. Sandstrom's first witness was Amy Fanion's sister, Anna Hansen. Hansen testified that after Amy's death, Brian Fanion confided that he was concerned about some searches he had made.",
      "\"I asked him what that search was, and he said how to make a murder look like a suicide,\" Hansen said on the witness stand. Under cross examination by the defense, Detective Tom Forest testified that he never found any searches related to those terms.",
      "On the morning of May 8, 2018, while Brian Fanion was still at work, he searched \"massachusetts medical examiner offices\" and visited a website that listed the units within the Massachusetts State Police forensics section.",
      "In her closing arguments, Sandstrom stated that that morning, Brian Fanion was preparing for his wife's murder. \"He's looking up and researching the units that will appear \u2026 after he's committed this murder. \u2026 the evidence in this case proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was going to murder Amy Fanion when he left the Westfield Police Department at 11:47 a.m. on May 8th.\"",
      "Brian Fanion's defense argued that Amy Fanion had anger issues and suffered from severe anxiety. After Amy's death, many members of her family signed a letter in support of Brian, stating that they were certain Amy had taken her own life. Several members of Amy Fanion's family took the stand, and although they were called as witnesses for the prosecution, their testimonies supported Brian Fanion's defense.",
      "After a month-long trial, the jury found Brian Fanion guilty of the first-degree murder of Amy Fanion. He was sentenced to life in prison. His conviction is under appeal.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. These companies say they're investing in domestic factories.",
    "story": [
      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "The basilica closed from 6 a.m. until 7 a.m., the planned opening time and, according to French news agency AFP, thousands lined up early Thursday to pay their respects.",
      "The Vatican said some 48,600 people filed past Francis' coffin from 11 a.m. Wednesday, when public tributes began, through 8:30 a.m. Thursday, AFP reported. Later Thursday, the Vatican put the number at 61,000, AFP said.",
      "The Vatican also announced that the pontiff's tomb can be visited starting Sunday morning, AFP reported.",
      "The basilica is bathed in a hushed silence as mourners from across the globe make a slow, shuffling procession up the main aisle to pay their last respects to Francis, who died Monday after a stroke and heart failure.",
      "The hours spent on line up the stately via della Conciliazione through St. Peter's Square and through the Holy Door into the basilica enabled mourners to find community around the Argentine pontiff's legacy of inclusion and humble persona.",
      "Emiliano Fernandez, a Catholic from Mexico, was waiting in line around midnight, and after two hours still hadn't reached the basilica.",
      "\"I don't even care how much time I wait here. It's just the opportunity to (show) how I admired Francisco in his life,'' said Fernandez, whose admiration for the pope grew during his 2016 visit to Mexico. \"I think because of the respect that I have for him and the great person he was, it's worth the wait.\"",
      "Among the first-day mourners was a church group of 14-year-olds from near Milan who arrived for the now-suspended canonization of the first millennial saint, as well as a woman who prayed to the pope for a successful operation and an Italian family who brought their small children to see the pope's body.",
      "\"We came because we didn't bring them when he was alive, so we thought we would bring them for a final farewell,'' said Rosa Scorpati, who was exiting the basilica Wednesday with her three children in strollers. \"They were good, but I don't think they really understood because they haven't yet had to deal with death.\"",
      "Like many others, the Scorpati family from Calabria was in Rome on an Easter vacation, only to be met with the news of Francis' death on Easter Monday.",
      "Out of devotion to the pope and his message of inclusion, the grieving faithful joined the procession of mourners that wended from St. Peter's Square through the basilica's Holy Door, with the repentant among them winning an indulgence, a form of atonement granted during the Jubilee Holy Year. From there, the line extended down the basilica's central aisle to the pope's simple wooden casket.",
      "After three days of public viewing, a funeral Mass including heads of state will be held Saturday in St. Peter's Square. The pope will then be buried in a niche within the St. Mary Major Basilica, near his favorite Madonna icon.",
      "The death of Francis, who was 88, capped a 12-year pontificate characterized by his concern for the poor and his message of inclusion, but he was also criticized by some conservatives who felt alienated by his progressive outlook.",
      "A procession of priests, bishops and cardinals accompanied Francis' body Wednesday on its journey from a private viewing inside the Vatican to St. Peter's Square. The pageantry contrasted with the human interactions of rank-and-file mourners at the public viewing.",
      "Francis lay in state in an open casket, perched on a ramp facing mourners, with four Swiss Guards standing at attention. As the crowd reached the casket, many lifted their smartphones to snap a photo.",
      "One nun accompanying an elderly woman with a cane walked away sobbing, \"My pope is gone.''",

    "story": [
      "Vatican City \u2014 Thousands of people began filing through St. Peter's Basilica to pay their final respects to Pope Francis on Wednesday at the start of three days of public viewing ahead of his funeral.",
      "Throngs of the faithful made their way to the 16th century basilica's main altar where Francis' open wooden casket was perched, as Swiss Guards stood at attention. Over the coming days, tens of thousands of people are expected to pass through, and the Vatican said it may extend the viewer hours even longer due to high turnout. In the first 8 1/2 hours, 19,430 people paid their respects to the pope.",
      "Francis was laid out in red robes, clasping a rosary and wearing a bishop's miter, the traditional pointed headdress. Mourners waited hours to reach the casket, which was behind a cordon. Some held their cell phones aloft as they neared to snap photos in what has become a modern ritual.",
      "\"It gave me chills,\" said Ivenes Bianco, as she left. She was in Rome from the southern city of Brindisi for medical care, and came to pay her respects. \"He was important to me because he encouraged co-existence. He brought many people together.''",
      "The body of the pope was moved to St. Peter's early Wednesday to lie in state for the Catholic faithful to pay their respects to the Argentine pontiff remembered for his humble style, concern for the poor and insistent prayers for peace.",
      "Pallbearers carried the simple wooden coffin on their shoulders through the Vatican's archway gates, out into St. Peter's Square and into the basilica, with a procession of cardinals in scarlet cassocks and Swiss Guards in their golden and blue uniforms slowly behind it.",
      "Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican temporarily until a new pope is elected, led the procession, with clouds of incense preceding him as the church choir began chanting the Litany of Saints hymn.",
      "Francis' casket wasn't put on an elevated bier \u2014 as was the case with past popes \u2014 but placed on a ramp, facing the pews. It was in keeping with his wishes for the rituals surrounding a papal funeral to be simplified to reflect his belief that the pope's role is that of simple pastor, not world leader.",
      "Cardinals, meanwhile, met in private to finalize preparations for Saturday's funeral and plan the conclave to elect Francis' successor.",
      "Heads of state are expected for Francis' funeral Saturday in St. Peter's Square, but the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to grieve the 88-year-old pope, who died Monday after, the Vatican said, he had a stroke and heart failure.",
      "Francis first lay in state in the Santa Marta Domus in a private viewing for Vatican residents and the papal household.",
      "Images released by the Vatican on Tuesday showed Francis lying in an open coffin, wearing the traditional pointed headdress of bishops and red robes, his hands folded over a rosary. The Vatican's No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, was pictured praying by Francis.",
      "His body was transferred from his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he died. The coffin will be kept open until midnight on Wednesday and Thursday to allow the faithful to mourn. The public mourning period will end on Friday at 7 p.m.",
      "Francis' coffin wasn't put on an elevated bier \u2014 as was the case with past popes \u2014 but was just placed on the main altar of the 16th-century basilica, simply facing the pews.",
      "Italian police have tightened security for the viewing and the funeral, carrying out foot and horse patrols around the Vatican, where pilgrims continued to arrive for the Holy Year celebrations that Francis opened in December.",
      "The funeral will be attended by leaders including President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The funeral Mass will be celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re. The papal funeral is broken down into\u00a0three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.",
      "Cardinals are continuing their meetings this week to plan the conclave to elect Francis' successor and make other decisions about running the Catholic Church as world leaders and the ordinary faithful grieve his death.",
      "History's first Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated many conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.",
      "He last appeared in public on Sunday with an Easter blessing and popemobile tour through a cheering crowd in St. Peter's Square.",
      "Church officials also shared some\u00a0details about the pope's final hours, describing \"a discreet death, almost sudden, without long suffering or public alarm.\"",

The coffin carrying the pope, who died Monday morning after suffering a stroke and heart failure at the age of 88, was brought in a procession on Wednesday morning to the basilica from his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he died.",
      "The late pontiff will lie in state inside St. Peter's Basilica for three days ahead of his funeral, with the faithful processing slowly up to his simple wooden coffin to pay their respects.",
      "A steady stream of cardinals, the most senior prelates in the Catholic Church, were the first to file up to Francis' coffin on Wednesday.",
      "The cardinals were followed by thousands of mourners from every walk of life, many waiting four hours or longer to see the pope's body.",

      "\"He was important to me because he encouraged co-existence,\" she told the AP. \"He brought many people together.''",
      "On Tuesday, the Vatican released the first photos and video of Francis since his death, showing him in his coffin wearing a red robe with the papal mitre on his head and a rosary intertwined in his hands.",
      "The images showed cardinals and other church officials performing what the Vatican said was the formal Confirmation of the Pope's Death and praying over his body.",
      "CBS News correspondent Seth Doane said the intimate service at the Santa Marta hotel on Tuesday gave senior clergy and Vatican insiders a private chance to pay their respects to Francis ahead of the more public lying in state at St. Peter's.",
      "Church officials also shared some details on Tuesday about the pope's final hours, describing \"a discreet death, almost sudden, without long suffering or public alarm.\"",
      "The interim administrator of the Vatican, Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who will play a major role in the funeral and subsequent events in the coming weeks, presided over the Wednesday morning procession to St. Peter's and the ritual transfer of the pope's body to the basilica.",
      "The funeral Mass will be celebrated on Saturday morning by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re. The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or  \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the  body, and then the burial.",
      "Who will come to Pope Francis' funeral?",
      "The funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday will draw \"Patriarchs, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and priests from across the globe,\" the Vatican said. It will also be attended by a number of world leaders and other dignitaries.",
      "President Trump said Monday that he and first lady Melania would attend, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and France's Emmanuel Macron. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was to attend, along with a number of other European heads of state, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany's\u00a0outgoing Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz.",
      "Among the first royals to confirm they will attend the funeral were King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium. The country's official Belga News agency confirmed that they would attend, noting the royal couple' social media post on Monday in which they honored Francis as, \"a great man, close to the most vulnerable and concerned with the problems of the world.\"",
      "King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain were also planning to be at the funeral, the French news agency AFP said Tuesday, citing the royal palace in Madrid.",
      "Kensington Palace said Tuesday that William, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne, would attend the pope's funeral on behalf of the U.K. royals, representing his father King Charles III. Charles, along with Queen Camilla, met with Francis at the Vatican less than two weeks before the pontiff died.",
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who is currently the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over war crimes allegedly committed during his country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, will not attend the pope's funeral, the Kremlin's chief spokesman said Tuesday.",
      "\"No. The president has no such plans,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about Francis' funeral. The ICC warrant severely limits Putin's ability to travel internationally, as any nation that's a signatory to the U.N. court's founding charter is legally obligated to arrest him if he enters its territory.",
      "The Reuters news agency said Brazil's President Luis Inacio da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also confirmed that they would attend the funeral. President Javier Milei of Argentina, where Francis was born in 1936, would also be at the funeral, according to his office.",
      "China's government indicated Tuesday that no decisions had been made regarding which officials might attend the service at the Vatican.",
      "What happens after Pope Francis' funeral?",
      "After the funeral Mass at St. Peter's, Pope Francis' coffin will be taken to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome, where he will be entombed. The pope chose to be buried at the smaller basilica, which is about four miles away, outside the Vatican walls. He prayed at St. Mary's often, before and after international trips during his 12-year pontificate.",
      "Between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, the\u00a0Cardinal Electors\u00a0will gather at the Vatican and seal themselves off from the world behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel for the papal conclave, the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 currently a group of about 135 \u2014 are eligible to vote in a conclave.",
      "The meeting of the cardinals on Tuesday was the first in what will be a series of gatherings culminating with the conclave. John Allen, editor of the Catholic news website \"Crux,\" told CBS News that the cardinals who were already at the Vatican to attend Tuesday's meeting would soon be joined by others from around the world.",
      "\"The really important part of these meetings begin when cardinals begin giving programmatic talks about where they believe the church stands \u2026 and what the profile of the man is needed to carry it forward,\" Allen told CBS News about the process leading up to the conclave.",
      "\"Let's be clear: These are not the Iowa Caucuses. Nobody's going to be standing up, barnstorming on behalf of their preferred candidate,\" he said, adding that one can, however, \"read between the lines\" of the addresses delivered by the cardinals \"to figure out, he's probably talking about cardinal so-and-so, or he may be talking against cardinal, so-in-so. \u2026 So this is as close to political sausage grinding as we're going to get in the process electing the next pope.\"",
      "For the actual conclave, the cardinals will cast ballots inside the Sistine Chapel, out of public view, for their choice to lead the church, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

      "Vice President JD Vance warned Wednesday that Moscow and Kyiv must strike a deal or Washington will end its efforts to reach a ceasefire. It was the second warning from the Trump administration in less than a week, despite President Trump's frequent pledges before his second term began that he would end the war immediately.",
      "\"We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance told reporters in India, where he is on a four-day visit.",
      "Vance spoke as envoys from Washington, Kyiv and European nations gathered for talks in the U.K. amid a new U.S. push to end Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "\"It's now time, I think, to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps, which is, at a broad level, the party saying we're going to stop the killing, we're going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,\" Vance added. \"Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, President Trump posted on Truth Social to blast Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for saying Ukraine will not recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea.",
      "\"This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? ... The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the 'killing field,' and nobody wants that! We are very close to a Deal, but the man with \"no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\"",
      "\"Enough is enough. The president's frustrated, his patience is running very thin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the White House Wednesday.",
      "Seemingly in response to Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy reposted on social media a 2018 statement from Mr. Trump's former Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in which Pompeo said, \"the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.\"",
      "Emotions have run high today. But it is good that 5 countries met to bring peace closer. Ukraine, the USA, the UK, France and Germany.

      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that his country was ready for any negotiations that might bring about a ceasefire, as he sent his condolences to the families of nine civilians killed in a Russian drone attack on a bus earlier in the day.",
      "\"We insist on an immediate, complete and unconditional ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. \"Stopping the killing is the number one task. I am grateful to everyone who is focused on this and helping to move towards the end of the war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail to strike a deal between Moscow and Kyiv in 24 hours, but has since failed to secure concessions from President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump proposed an unconditional ceasefire in March, the principle of which was accepted by Kyiv but rejected by Putin.",
      "The White House welcomed a separate agreement by both sides to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days, but the Kremlin has said it considers that moratorium to have expired.",
      "The remarks from Trump and Vance came as senior officials from the U.S., France, the U.K., Germany and Ukraine were holding talks in London aimed at securing a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out of higher-level talks that had been scheduled, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Rubio said he had spoken to his British counterpart, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, on Tuesday night, calling the conversation \"productive.\" He said the U.S. delegation to London was being led by Special Presidential Envoy Keith Kellogg.",

      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 An overnight Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City killed at least 10 people and injured dozens of others, according to the Gaza health ministry run by Hamas. The strike came as officials said Arab mediators worked on a proposal to end the war with Hamas that would include a five-to-seven-year truce and the release of all remaining hostages.",
      "There was no immediate Israeli comment on the strike, which set several tents ablaze, burning people alive. The Israel Defense Forces says it only targets militants, and it blames all civilian deaths on Hamas, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that Israel accuses of positioning fighters and weapons in densely populated areas.",
      "Another six people were killed in separate strikes, including 5-year-old twin girls, health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory said.",
      "France, Germany and Britain meanwhile said Israel's seven-week blockade on all imports to Gaza, including food, was \"intolerable,\" in unusually strong criticism from three of the country's closest allies.",
      "Egypt and Qatar are still developing the latest peace proposal, which would include the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners, according to an Egyptian official and a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month and has vowed to continue the war until all hostages are returned and Hamas is destroyed or disarmed and sent into exile. It says it will hold parts of Gaza indefinitely and implement President Trump's proposal for the resettlement of the population in other countries, which has been widely rejected internationally.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the dozens of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners, a complete Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire, as called for in the now-defunct agreement reached in January. A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo late Tuesday to discuss the evolving proposal.",
      "In a seeming bid to increase pressure on Israel, where regular protests have seen hostage family members and others demand that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu make a deal to bring home the remaining captives, Hamas released a video on Wednesday purportedly showing one of the surviving hostages appeal for help.",
      "The three-minute video posted online by Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, shows a man who identifies himself as 48-year-old Omri Miran, an Israeli-Hungarian hostage, addressing the camera directly and acknowledging the protests in Israel. He says he and the other surviving hostages, of whom Israel believes there are 24, live in constant fear amid their own country's ongoing bombing of Gaza, and he calls for an agreement to be struck as quickly as possible for their release.",
      "Hamas has released a series of similar undated hostage videos, showing captives making appeals that have clearly been recorded under duress.",
      "The Egyptian official said the latest proposed truce would include international guarantees and would last between five and seven years, and that a committee of politically independent technocrats would govern Gaza during that time \u2013 a measure Hamas has accepted.",
      "The Hamas official who provided The Associated Press with the rough details of the proposal said the group was open to a long-term truce that includes the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and international guarantees, naming Russia, China, Turkey or the United Nations Security Council as possible guarantors.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials. Israel has ruled out any arrangement that would allow Hamas to preserve its influence in Gaza and rearm. The Trump administration, which has also been involved in the ceasefire talks, has said it fully supports Israel's position.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have pressed Hamas to accept a temporary truce in which it would immediately release several hostages in return for promises of talks on a more permanent ceasefire. Hamas has rejected those proposals and says it won't disarm as long as Israel occupies Palestinian territory.",
      "The Hamas official said the group does not trust Netanyahu or the U.S. after they shattered the last ceasefire agreement, which had facilitated the release of over 30 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",

But the North Korean forces launched a surprise attack that forced one group of soldiers to retreat in late November. A few days later, Chinese soldiers surrounded and isolated another group of soldiers. A task force was hastily assembled to try to organize a withdrawal. A \"bitter fight\" allowed U.N. forces to open an airfield to bring in reinforcements and evacuate casualties on December 1, according to the U.S. military, and eventually, the U.N. soldiers managed a full retreat.",

The unidentified remains were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the DPAA said.",
      "From 1990 to 1994, the North Korean government returned 47 additional containers of remains attributed to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. From those recovery efforts, the DPAA and the organizations that preceded it were able to identify over 130 of the unaccounted-for missing personnel lost in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign.",

    "summary": "A longtime Vatican correspondent shares his insights on the legacy of Pope Francis, a populist leader who sought to bring the Church closer to the people.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 He was a populist leader, often referred to as the \"People's Pope.\" As pontiff, Francis, who died Monday at age 88, sought to bring the Church closer to the people, stating early in his papacy that he wanted to have a poorer Church \"for the poor.\" He was known for being driven around in unflashy cars and for making folksy gestures, like taking trips into Rome to buy an item at the store.",
      "He was brilliant at playing to the press, creating the sorts of photo-ops that would draw attention to his areas of interest. He'd often speak extemporaneously while on papal voyages, particularly toward the beginning of his papacy, fielding questions on the flight.",
      "That made his papal trips a must-attend event for the press covering him. For those of us who got to travel with Pope Francis, we could see how he'd interact over the course of days with various dignitaries and his wider flock of the faithful. He'd appear particularly energized and engaged, lighting up when with children or in an audience with those who were cast aside, living on the margins of society.",
      "He died just a day after surprising many with a brief appearance in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, blessing thousands of people and sounding stronger as he did so than he had since his release from a Rome hospital at the end of March.",
      "We wanted to look back on his papacy, his legacy, and also look forward to the next pope, so we asked veteran Vatican correspondent Francis X. Rocca to meet recently on the terrace of a convent in Rome, with a spectacular view out over St. Peter's Basilica, for a chat about Pope Francis.",
      "We look back, and ahead. Below is a partial transcript from our conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "SETH DOANE: What is Pope Francis' legacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I suppose it depends on whom you ask. I mean, for women, for example, he certainly was someone who brought women in the Vatican, and gave them higher positions than had ever been the case. It's still a relatively small number, but that was certainly a very dramatic change. For conservatives, he started by giving them heartburn and ended up by giving practically a heart attack. It was quite a dramatic confrontation. In some ways was a polarizing pope. At the same time that he really pushed the envelope and allowed things to be spoken about that had been considered closed, whether on sexual ethics, on medical ethics. \u2026 In a way, because of his very informal style of discourse, talking to journalists, giving interviews, press conferences, he seemed to give permission to people to criticize him, too, even if that wasn't his intention. So the debate became much more heated during his pontificate.",
      "SETH DOANE: Why was Pope Francis seen as such a divisive figure? Why did conservatives dislike him?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I think there were a number of reasons. One is that he had a very\u00a0 loose attitude toward tradition, let's put it that way. From the very beginning, when he stepped out on the loggia in the front of St. Peter's Basilica, and he didn't wear the red cape that was customary on that occasion \u2014 before he even said a word, already people started to get nervous, conservatives started to get nervous that he was just not going to respect tradition.",
      "And he broke it in small ways like that, but he also tested it in bigger ways. And, for example, relatively late in his pontificate, gave permission for the blessings of same-sex couples. They tried to present that as something that was consistent with tradition, but it certainly wasn't seen that way by conservatives. And especially in Africa, where basically all the bishops of sub-Saharan Africa protested and wanted a kind of exemption from this new permission, which is extraordinary. And that's just a very clear illustration how divisive things became, when you have an entire continent \u2014 a continent where the Church is growing very quickly \u2014 taking a completely different stand from other parts of the Church. That happened under Pope Francis, and it happened because he made a bold move.",
      "SETH DOANE: Conservative Catholics in America were some of his loudest critics.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yes, that's right. He had a the majority of the U.S. bishops were not on board with his priorities, I think that's pretty clear. The pope and his allies among the U.S. bishops, who are a minority, wanted to play down abortion. The pope hated abortion, but he wanted to play [it] down, with respect to social and environmental and economic issues, or at least put them on an equal plane. That's maybe the better way to put it. The U.S. bishops have for years said that opposition to abortion is their \"preeminent priority.\" And the pope and his allies didn't want that, and they weren't able to persuade the majority of U.S. bishops about that, and that became a very, very big point of tension.",
      "SETH DOANE: We traveled with the pope together. One of the things that struck me was how he was with kids \u2014 he would kind of come alive in a way.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: He was very approachable. He was very informal. That was the \u2014 one of the beguiling, charming things, charismatic things about him. His predecessors are \u2014 John Paul was a very charismatic figure, very telegenic, but he was not so relaxed. And Pope Francis had an ordinary style that appealed to people.",
      "SETH DOANE: Pope Francis was known as the \"People's Pope.\" He was known to reach out to try to pull in the masses.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah. He was also a populist pope, with a kind of political resonance. His style was very much to try to have a bond with the people, with \u2014 implicitly or sometimes not so implicitly, against the elites, in this case, the hierarchy: the bishops and the cardinals. He kind of played off of them. And he was always sort of suggesting that the elites, even the Diocesan clergy priests and parish priests, could be aloof from their people, could be too rigid, could be too attached to luxury or to privilege. And so he was always beating that drum and saying, \"No. I'm with the people.\"",
      "SETH DOANE: This pope tried to tackle sexual abuse issues within the clergy, within the Church. He tried to tackle the vast bureaucracy and economic issues in the Church. How did he do?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I \u2014 his record on sex abuse was mixed. And I think actually not up to the level that people had expected of him. He had a kind of a distaste for disciplining the priests and bishops compared with his predecessor, Pope Benedict. Pope Benedict the high water mark in terms of discipline of abusive clergy. Pope Francis stepped back a bit from that. He got in trouble for that in Chile, when he was very stubbornly supportive of a bishop who'd been accused of covering up sex abuse. He finally backed down, but it was an embarrassment.",
      "SETH DOANE: What were some of the big issues under Pope Francis' papacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, certainly a big issue was his relative leniency on questions of marriage, the family, and sexuality. The single most famous statement from his pontificate was the one he made at his very first press conference in 2013, which was, \"Who am I to judge?\" He was talking, in that case, about gay priests. But he could have been talking about divorced Catholics, whom he allowed to take communion, in many cases, which had not been the practice before. He could have been talking about Catholics who use contraception. Pope Francis didn't change teaching formally on any of these issues. But what he did was signal that it was OK to have different points of view about them, that it was not a priority \u2014 that he was not censuring anyone. And, in fact, some of his advisors here explored, for example, the possibility of relaxing the ban on contraception that had been so controversial since Pope Paul VI had reaffirmed it in 1968. So those are some issues.",
      "Another issue: He had a rapprochement with China, which was controversial, even among Chinese Catholics, where he \u2026 agreed to share responsibility for choosing Catholic bishops in China with the Communist government there. And that was controversial. He felt that it was important to have dialogue and to keep the Church unified at some level, but a lot of the Catholics who resisted government control in China resented that and felt that he was selling them out.",
      "SETH DOANE: One of the regular criticisms of this pope was that he sowed confusion. Why was that heard so often?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, he played with ambiguity. A lot of his statement were made in an informal manner at press conferences and in interviews, not in doctrinal documents that came out from the Vatican. And so therefore he, you know, when he says, \"Who am I to judge?\" \u2014 well, what does that mean? Conservatives tried very hard to read that in a way very consistent with strict tradition. And you could if you wished. But the pope was very media savvy. He knew how his comments would play. He knew how his soundbites and headlines would play, and so when he made a statement like that, he knew that most people would read that as meaning that sexual morality, or at least in that case, was a matter of conscience, that people could follow their own conscience. That's not explicitly what he said, but when he said, \"Who am I to judge?\" he seemed to be saying, \"This is a private affair, this is someone with his own conscience.\" And that's how many people read it, even if he didn't explicitly say that.",
      "SETH DOANE: During his papacy, Pope Francis changed the feeling of the Church. You saw him driving around in simple cars, sometimes going out into Rome to buy something at a store. The feeling of who a pope is changed even in where he decided to live, at the Santa Marta Hotel, and not in the Apostolic Palace.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah, that's right, even wearing, you know, ordinary black shoes, or having his Argentinian passport renewed, wearing the white skull cap in the photo. That's true: He was definitely very deliberate. He wanted to make the pope seem more with the people, and to pull down some of the barriers. And that's why he had a very tactile, approachable style. It will be interesting to see if his successor feels the need to maintain that, or will go back to something more traditional and more formal.",
      "SETH DOANE: In the long arc of the Church's history, how much will Francis' papacy really have changed?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, the long march of papal history is very long indeed. One thing is he was the first pope from the Americas, and the first pope from the Global South. So he'll always have a place in the history books for that reason. Beyond that, it depends on what happens next. I mean, if the next pope is going to carry forward his progressive approach, and if that's going to continue and change the Church, and Church teaching is going to change on things like women's ordination, you know, or homosexuality, if it's actually going to change, then he will be a historic figure in that respect. If we go back to something more traditional, then that will be a kind of an anomaly. But he will remain in the history books because of where he's from.",
      "SETH DOANE: Looking ahead to the next pope, did Pope Francis, if you will, \"stack the decks\" enough that the College of Cardinals is likely to go with a more progressive, more liberal pope? Or does the pendulum swing the other way?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, that's always the big question. Certainly Pope Francis was notable,\u00a0 and even some of his supporters acknowledge this, in not choosing people who didn't agree with him as cardinals. He tended to choose people like that. On the other hand, he chose a lot of people from far-flung regions, from places that had never had a cardinal before, about whom we know very little, and probably Pope Francis didn't know very much either. So that's a bit of a wild card. There's also the issue that cardinals tend to be pretty conservative people \u2014 \"conservative\" with a small \"c.\" They tend to want not to rock the boat too much, and Pope Francis rocked the boat continually.",
      "SETH DOANE: We could see a more conservative pope next?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Certainly it's very possible that we'll see a pope with a more conservative temperament, a more conservative governing style, a more conservative communicative style. Maybe not a hard-right conservative, in terms of doctrine, we might not get that. But we might get someone who's going to \u2014 the College of Cardinals wants to calm the waters. It's been a very turbulent period under Pope Francis, and so they might want someone who will just not speak quite so often to the press, not stir things up, not shake things up for a while. We could be looking at that.",

      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago.

      "Filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, the lawsuit challenges Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on imports from countries worldwide.\"Once again, Democrats like Letitia James are prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote exclusively to Fox News Digital. \"The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing\u2014both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.\"The 12 states, however, argue that the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and tariffs, and that IEEPA was never intended to authorize trade policy on this scale.",

      "Brodsky added that Moriarty's latest legal blunder is consistent with her legacy in Walz's home state. Moriarty, who handed Adams a \"pre-charge diversion\" on Monday, has been backed by groups tied to money from megadonor George Soros, one of the most prominent backers of progressive issues in the United States.",
      "\"It would be an understatement to say that Progressive County Attorney Mary Moriarty has been soft on crime since she took office in 2023. She has consistently shown undue leniency for violent criminal suspects charged with sexual assault and even murder. It is one of the many reasons the Minneapolis Police Department has been at loggerheads with the county attorney\u2019s office, to say nothing of the outrage among the victims\u2019 families,\" Brodsky said.",

      "Nagel questioned how many tax dollars were invested in finding Adams \"only to have their efforts wiped out by a progressive prosecutor\" and leaving Minnesota dealerships on alert \"knowing someone can come into their lot and damage cars.\"",
      "As Republicans ripped the state's \"soft on crime\" practices, they tied Walz's own anti-Telsa rhetoric to the string of violence against Elon Musk's multi-billionaire electric vehicle business. Amid the string of attacks on Tesla as its stock was taking a tumble, Walz told a Wisconsin town hall that he checks Tesla's stock when he wants to feel better.",
      "\"Gov. Walz\u2019s rhetoric on Tesla stock, Democrats all over the country spewing,'We need to rise up and take it to the streets' is all fueling the fire. Angry elected Democrats are encouraging this kind of behavior. Refusing to hold adults accountable for attacks based on their political hatred is bound to end badly for regular folks,\" Nagel added.",

      "\"It\u2019s likely not a coincidence that the suspect in this case is a State of Minnesota employee with the Department of Human Services. Moreover, these attacks began the same day that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made controversial remarks where he cheered the decline of Tesla stocks and disparaged Elon Musk at a Wisconsin event on March 18. The double-standards here speak for themselves. Political violence appears to be acceptable if carried out by progressives. Needless to say, this will undoubtedly embolden pProgressive activists to engage in further attacks,\" Brodsky said.",

      "Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a lawsuit Monday against Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, alleging the popular platform has been \"openly defying\" state law aimed at protecting young minors from addictive social media features and obscene and dangerous content.",
      "Attorney General Uthmeier, who was recently appointed by Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, alleged in a circuit court complaint filed Monday that Snapchat utilizes addictive features to attract minors under the age of 13, who companies like Snapchat aren't even allowed to provide accounts to under state law H.B. 3 in Florida.",
      "The suit also alleges Snapchat does not adequately verify its users' ages, noting parental consent is required in Florida for Snapchat users who are under 16, and has been deceptive about its identification of content that is not supposed to be accessible to minors.",
      "\"Snap's conduct is particularly egregious because it continues to market Snapchat in Florida as safe for users as young as 13 even though it knows that Snapchat can be easily used to access pornography and buy drugs, among many other dangers,\" Uthmeier's complaint states. \"Rather than obeying Florida law by removing 13-year-old users from the platform and seeking parental consent for 14- and 15-year-old users, Snap is actively deceiving Florida parents about the risks of allowing their teens to access this platform.\"",

      "Uthmeier argued in his suit that Snapchat's current age ratings for content are \"highly deceptive and unfair,\" pointing to a Washington Post columnist who tested Snapchat's AI chatbot feature and was able to get it to provide instructions to a 13-year-old on how to mask the smell of pot and alcohol. He pointed to Snapchat's \"Find Friends\" feature as well, among others, which Uthmeier alleged has \"connected minors with adult strangers seeking to groom, harass, exploit, and even assault them, or to sell them illegal drugs.\"",
      "According to Uthmeier, Snapchat has recognized in other litigation that it is subject to the provisions under Florida's H.B. 3, leading him to assert in the Monday complaint that the platform is \"openly defying this important public health measure.\"",
      "However, Snap Inc. argues that the underlying premise of Uthmeier's complaint, that Snapchat is violating H.B. 3, is flawed because the law infringes on the First Amendment rights of adults and young people. Simultaneously, Snap Inc. said, H.B. 3 fails to adequately address age verification and opens up Floridians to data protection and privacy issues.",
      "TEENS ARE TURNING TO SNAPCHAT'S \u2018MY AI\u2019 FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT \u2013 WHICH DOCTORS WARN AGAINST",
      "\"We believe there are more privacy-conscious solutions to online safety and managing age verification, including at the operating system, app store, or device level,\"\u00a0a Snap Inc. spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"In addition, there is a current challenge to the constitutionality of this law pending in Florida federal court, and we hoped that the state would allow this challenge to proceed through the proper legal process. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve decided to file a complaint in state court in an attempt to bypass the issues that are already being heard in federal court.\"",

Ron DeSantis, alleged in a circuit court complaint filed Monday that Snapchat utilizes addictive features to attract minor users under the age of 13, which state law H.B. 3 prohibits companies like Snapchat from doing.

      "H.B. 3 has been challenged by industry groups in a lawsuit last year arguing the state law violated First Amendment rights. The plaintiff's in that suit, the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, which collectively represent numerous major social media platforms including Snapchat, have also challenged other state laws aimed at protecting minors from harmful social media features and content on the grounds they violate the First Amendment.",
      "The law prohibits social media apps that utilize certain addictive features, such as push notifications, autoplay features, infinity scrolling, and more, from allowing users under the age of 13 to open an account. For users under 16, parental notification must be obtained.",
      "The bill also requires companies like Snapchat that knowingly publish adult content on their platforms to take steps to prohibit access to such material by any users under 18.",
      "SNAPCHAT AI CHATBOT ALLEGEDLY GAVE ADVICE TO 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL ON RELATIONSHIP WITH 31-YEAR-OLD MAN, HAVING SEX",
      "According to the law, any platforms that knowingly or recklessly violate H.B. 3's requirements can be subject to enforcement under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, which can result in fines of up to $50,000 per incident. Meanwhile, account holders who are minors may also pursue up to $10,000 in damages.",
      "\"We\u2019re actively challenging Florida\u2019s law because it violates the First Amendment,\" Paul Taske, NetChoice Associate Director of Litigation, told Fox News Digital. \"We\u2019re confident we will be successful.\"",

      "\"The Big Weekend Show\" analyzes the possibilities of artificial intelligence when it comes to influencing voters.",
      "If you haven\u2019t heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new AI model unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect. This isn\u2019t just another chatbot. It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you\u2019re eager to try out the latest AI or you\u2019d rather steer clear, it\u2019s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.",

      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",

      "GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET",
      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As we move forward with AI like Manus, it\u2019s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.",
      "So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.",

      "Flying robots bring precision and efficiency to harvesting",
      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson talks about how Yamaha\u2019s hydrogen outboard motor could revolutionize boating with zero emissions.",
      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",
      "This is part of Yamaha\u2019s big plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, using a mix of electric, alternative fuels and now hydrogen technology.",

      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",
      "Hydrogen fuel tanks (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RIDE THE WAVES WITH THE MOST ADVANCED WAKE BOAT EVER",
      "What\u2019s different about this hydrogen outboard?",
      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",
      "Hydrogen fuel tanks (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE",
      "Safety first: Smart systems on board",
      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

      "HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS HIT THE ROADS IN GEORGIA",
      "Showing off the tech and what\u2019s next",
      "Yamaha first showed off this hydrogen outboard at the Miami Boat Show, then took it to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas to get the automotive and marine industries talking about hydrogen infrastructure. They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early.",
      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before.",

      "The life-saving power of wearable technology",
      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",

      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early.

      "Data breaches usually happen for one reason \u2014 financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",
      "When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully.",
      "Equifax: You can place a\u00a0fraud alert online\u00a0or by calling their customer support at (888) 298-0045.",

      "Now that your credit accounts are secured, there\u2019s one more step worth taking, a broader layer of protection. I\u2019m talking about personal data removal services. These companies specialize in removing your personal information from the internet. With how easy it is for someone to find details like your name, address, contact info, relatives \u00a0and more, you and your loved ones are at greater risk for scams and identity theft.",
      "This is especially true for older adults, who are often seen as easier targets by scammers. Even just for peace of mind, it\u2019s worth taking this extra step. There are plenty of services out there that tackle this issue.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Encourage your loved ones to regularly review their bank and credit card statements for any suspicious transactions or do it for them. Early detection can help prevent significant financial loss.",
      "Many elderly people fall victim to scams due to limited digital literacy. Providing basic cybersecurity education, such as recognizing phishing emails, avoiding suspicious links and using strong passwords, can significantly reduce their risk of being targeted. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "Remember that protecting your loved ones from cyber threats and identity theft is an ongoing process. It\u2019s not just about taking a few steps and forgetting about it. It's about continually updating your strategies as new threats emerge. By combining these measures, like freezing credit accounts, using fraud alerts, removing personal data from the internet, installing strong antivirus software, regularly reviewing financial statements and educating them on internet safety, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind for both you and your loved ones.",

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach.",
      "One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable.",
      "Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Person plugging USB flash drive into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why target USB flash drives?",
      "USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "When infected, USB drives can spread\u00a0malware not just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don\u2019t rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools.",
      "USB flash drive plugged into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How hackers are targeting your USB drives",
      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",

      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "How to scan a USB flash drive for malware (PC & Mac)",
      "No matter which antivirus tool you use, it\u2019s essential to scan USB flash drives as soon as you plug them in. Here\u2019s how to do it on both platforms:",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it\u2019s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don\u2019t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.",

      "Parker Jensen, an 18-year-old Marine Corps enlistee, has since sued the school district, arguing he was wrongfully suspended for voicing his concerns about the flags at Towson High School, north of Baltimore. The flags were missing from two of his classrooms, and he approached the Baltimore Board of Education about the issue.",
      "\"He really thought there'd be something that could be resolved easily, and he was looking forward to finishing out his senior year,\" Jensen's attorney, Sarah Spitalnick, told Fox News Digital. \"He's definitely discouraged that the school took this route in the way they retaliated and punished him. And it did\u2026 put a big damper on his senior year. At this point, he's still not allowed to go to prom. \u2026 He still has teachers that he knows do not like him. That could affect his grades and affect his ability to graduate.\"",
      "The issue began in February, when Jensen \u2014 also the quarterback and captain of the Towson High School football team \u2014 noticed that two of his classrooms were missing American flags despite the fact that Maryland state law mandates that flags need to be in all public school classrooms.",

      "\"This experience has impacted me personally in both positive and negative ways,\" Jensen told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"On the negative side, I was suspended and trespassed unlawfully, had my character unfairly defamed by my administration, and was treated poorly by my teacher upon returning to school. Those moments were difficult and disheartening.",
      "\"However, on the positive side, I believe my persistence in standing up for patriotism may have opened others eyes to the importance of patriotism in our school systems,\" Jensen said. \"At the end of the day, I believe it was beneficial, not just for me, but for the entire school community. It serves as a reminder that it is our responsibility, as citizens, to hold our government accountable and I believe I did just that within my school.\"",

      "\"They had the police just escort him out. The police also made statements that only reporters can film within their property, which is completely false,\" Spitalnick said. \"They lied to him and basically said that what he was doing was unlawful when, really, he has every right to do what he did.\"",

      "Cardinal Robert Sarah \u2013 championed by conservatives as reflecting the doctrinaire and liturgically minded papacies of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI \u2013 is among those being considered to replace Pope Francis.",
      "An African cardinal from Guinea, Sarah, 79, is viewed as a spiritual and theological standard-bearer for conservative Catholics, as critics of Francis have argued the late pope was too heavily influenced by modern secularism.",
      "Sarah previously headed the Vatican\u2019s charity office Cor Unum and clashed with Francis on many occasions.",
      "Their ideological divide most seriously came to a head when Sarah and Benedict \u2013 who retired as acting pope in 2013 \u2013 co-authored a book titled \"From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.\" The 2020 book advocated the \"necessity\" of continued celibacy for Latin Rite priests and came out as Francis was weighing whether to allow married priests in the Amazon to address a priest shortage there.",

The prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one created the scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of when Benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement as \"pope emeritus.\" The scandal died down after Benedict removed himself as a co-author.",
      "It's actually Sarah's 2019 book that's causing more of a stir with conservative Christians in the wake of Francis' passing.",
      "Sarah has described \"The Day Is Now Far Spent\" as his most significant book. In it, the cardinal decries how Europe and Western civilization have turned away from Christianity and suffer from ideological challenges brought by mass migration.",

      "Vance, one of the last dignitaries to meet with Francis on Easter Sunday before his passing, has referenced Pope John Paul II \u2013 ideologically more similar to Sarah \u2013 in recent public addresses.

The vice president also celebrated John Paul II's call for new evangelization at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.",

      "VANCE WAS ONE OF POPE FRANCIS' LAST VISITORS",
      "2. Gender ideology is \u2018Luciferian\u2019",

    "summary": "More than a dozen senior lawyers in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \u2013 many with decades of experience \u2013 have been reassigned.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has quietly transformed the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, forcing out a majority of career managers and implementing new priorities that current and former officials say abandon a decadeslong mission of enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination in hiring, housing and voting rights.",
      "More than a dozen senior lawyers \u2014 many with decades of experience working under presidents of both parties \u2014\u00a0have been reassigned, the current and former officials say.\u00a0Some have resigned in frustration after they were moved to less desirable roles unrelated to their expertise, according to the sources.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a complete bloodbath,\u201d said a senior Justice Department lawyer in the division who is not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Last week, President Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked head of the division issued a series of memos outlining priorities that are dramatically at odds with the way both Republican and Democratic administrations have enforced civil rights law \u2014 including the first Trump administration.",
      "Rather than focusing on enforcing federal laws against discrimination, the division is now charged with pursuing priorities laid out in a series of Trump\u2019s executive orders, including \u201cKeeping Men out of Women's Sports\u201d and \u201cEnding Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,\u201d according to the memos, which were issued by division head Harmeet Dhillon and obtained by NBC News.",
      "Dhillon is a\u00a0conservative culture warrior\u00a0who represented Trump in challenging the results of the 2020 election and ardently backed his baseless claims of fraud.",
      "The changes have not been publicly announced by the Justice Department. Reuters first reported some of them Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a 180 shift from the division\u2019s traditional mission,\u201d said a former senior official in the division who declined to be named in fear of retaliation.",
      "\"These documents appear to have been created in a vacuum completely divorced from reality,\" the former official said. \"The division can only enforce statutes that have been passed by Congress, and these orders seem to contemplate division attorneys\u2019 executing on work that fundamentally departs from the division\u2019s long-standing mission.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Dhillon portrayed the changes as a normal shift of emphasis in a new administration, as well as a quest for efficiency.",
      "\u201cEach new administration has its own priorities, and allocates resources accordingly,\" Dhillon said. \"The Trump administration is no different. When I assumed my duties as Assistant Attorney General, I learned that certain sections in Civil Rights had substantial existing caseloads and backlogs, and that formed the basis of temporary details to assist those sections in getting, and staying, caught up.\"",
      "She added: \u201cThe Civil Rights Division looks forward to continuing to\u00a0aggressively\u00a0protecting\u00a0the civil rights of Americans.\"",
      "NBC News spoke to 10 current and former employees of the Civil Rights Division for this article, as well as other sources familiar with the Justice Department\u2019s operations.\u00a0Most declined to be identified, citing fear of retaliation.",
      "The sources say many of the division\u2019s section chiefs have been transferred to roles unrelated to their legal backgrounds, including in the complaint adjudication office and the office that handles public records requests.",
      "\u201cEvery presidential administration has its own policy priorities,\" said Stacey Young, who spent 18 years in the division before resigning in January, \"but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any precedent for an administration almost completely refocusing the civil rights division\u2019s enforcement priorities the way this one has.\"",
      "\"The loss is truly hard to quantify,\" added Young, who co-founded Justice Connection, a group now trying to highlight Trump administration changes to the Justice Department. \"Vital civil rights work is not going to get done.\"",
      "The overhaul of the Civil Rights Division is a microcosm of what has been happening across the federal government, as the Trump administration has removed nonpartisan civil servants and dismantled or reoriented federal agencies with a speed and an audacity that few thought was possible.\u00a0Similar changes have been happening to a lesser degree at other Justice Department offices, current and former officials say. But they say the extent of the repurposing of the Civil Rights Division stands out.",
      "Founded in 1957 after the passage of the 20th\u00a0century\u2019s first major civil rights legislation, the Civil Rights Division has always been subject to the policy preferences of the president, and enforcement priorities tend to differ in Republican and Democratic administrations.\u00a0But there is no precedent for the changes that have been made over the last three months, which are far more consequential than anything that occurred in Trump\u2019s first term, current and former officials say.",
      "\u201cI was there almost 18 years, and what\u2019s happening now is basically the opposite of what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said a veteran lawyer who recently left the department. \u201cIn the first Trump administration, they engaged with us as attorneys.\u00a0The political appointees were normal lawyers.\u00a0Sometimes we persuaded them and sometimes they disagreed, but there was always a conversation about why and what the law required. That is not happening.\u201d",
      "In the Biden administration, the Civil Rights Division convicted 180 police officers of violating people\u2019s civil rights, according to Justice Department records.\u00a0It also prosecuted a variety of high-profile hate crimes cases, including one against the Texas man who targeted Mexicans when he killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso and the Pennsylvania man who killed 11 congregants at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.",
      "Among the many settlements over racial discrimination, the division secured reforms at Hawkins County Schools in Tennessee, where an investigation found that incidents of harassment \u2014 including a mock \u201cslave auction\u201d to sell Black students to their white counterparts and a \u201cmonkey of the month\u201d campaign to ridicule Black students \u2014 created a racially hostile environment. On voting rights, the division\u00a0successfully challenged\u00a0an Arizona law requiring people registering to vote to list their birthplaces and provide proof of citizenship.",
      "Current and former employees say many of those enforcement actions are unimaginable under the new regime.",
      "\u201cThey are withdrawing everything we\u2019ve done and taking the opposite side on voting rights, for example,\u201d said a recently departed Civil Division lawyer. \u201cThis is not \u2018Oh, we want to do more religion cases\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t want to do creative redlining cases.\u2019 This is abandoning everything that we have done in the past.\u00a0They are actively anti-civil rights. This didn\u2019t happen in Trump 1.\u201d",
      "Dhillon took office April 7, but the changes had already been underway.\u00a0So far the Civil Rights Division has suspended investigations of police abuse and launched probes into whether Los Angeles is\u00a0violating people\u2019s gun rights and whether American universities are\u00a0tolerating antisemitism.\u00a0The division was also involved in the\u00a0lawsuit filed last week accusing the state of Maine of violating the law by allowing transgender athletes to participate on women\u2019s sports teams.",
      "At the same time, current and former officials say, the managerial jobs vacated in recent weeks have not been filled, so the traditional work of the division has all but stopped.",
      "\u201cIf regular Americans think that this administration is going to protect their rights, they\u2019re just wrong,\" a recently departed division lawyer said.",
      "In their\u00a0Project 2025 blueprint, conservative Trump backers wrote that Trump should \u201creorganize and refocus the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division to serve as the vanguard\u201d for what they called a \u201creturn to lawfulness.\u201d",
      "\u201cEntities across the private and public sectors in the United States have been besieged in recent years by an unholy alliance of special interests, radicals in government, and the far Left,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis unholy alliance speaks in platitudes about advancing the interests of certain segments of American society, but that advancement comes at the expense of other Americans and in nearly all cases violates long-standing federal law.\u201d",
      "Dhillon\u2019s memos, issued last week, laid out a sweeping set of new priorities.",
      "The Federal Coordination and Compliance Section, for example, had been tasked with enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by preventing and remedying discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion and shared ancestry in federally funded programs across the country.",
      "Dhillon\u2019s memo says the section now has new priorities, not mentioned in the 1964 law but outlined in Trump\u2019s executive orders, including those on \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism,\u201d \u201cRestoring Merit Based Opportunity\u201d and \u201cDesignating English as the Official Language of the United States.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi hosted a meeting of a new Trump administration task force on \u201cEradicating Anti-Christian Bias.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses,\u201d she said."

      "\"Big law, stop bending the knee,\" reads a poster from the \"Big Law Cowards\" campaign by the liberal nonprofit group Demand Justice. The group says the ads will be wheatpasted strategically around Washington on Thursday near the locations of the firms that have reached deals with the administration. The group will also have a mobile billboard circulating with ads criticizing the firms, along with a broader digital campaign.",
      "The judicial branch is pushing back against other executive orders targeting firms that didn\u2019t reach deals with the Trump administration \u2014 and the firms that did make deals are managing both internal and external fallout from their decisions.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell grilled Justice Department lawyer Richard Lawson about the executive order against Perkins Coie, one of the law firms that refused to reach a deal with the Trump administration and sued it, instead.",
      "Maggie Jo Buchanan, the interim executive director of Demand Justice, told NBC News that her group hoped to highlight the need for the powerful to act in support of the values of the legal profession, defend the rule of law and support American values.",
      "\u201cWhen you see some of the most powerful law firms in the country, if not the world, unwilling to stand up to the administration when ordinary people are speaking out, we think it\u2019s really important to shine a bright light on that and really show that ordinary people demand that those most powerful speak out against the administration and not bend the knee,\u201d she said.",
      "Nine firms have reached deals with Trump: A&O Shearman; Kirkland; Latham & Watkins; Simpson Thacher; Cadwalader; Milbank; Skadden; Willkie; and Paul Weiss. The Demand Justice campaign will highlight those firms and the amounts they have pledged in free legal work, which total nearly $1 billion.",
      "Buchanan said that law firm employees who decided to walk away from their positions at those firms had shown \"real bravery\" and that it was important to highlight those who took a bold stance.",
      "\"It takes a lot to walk away from a very lucrative position,\" she said. \"But I think what we're really seeing is people sticking by their principles and being willing to speak out, not only against their employer, their former employer, but really stand up for the rule of law.\"",
      "Rachel Cohen, a former associate at Skadden who quit in protest last month before the firm reached a deal, told NBC News that the response to her decision to speak out has been \"overwhelming\" and that resignations from other firms have continued to roll in, including those of some people who chose to leave their firms quietly. Cohen said she hopes partners at the firms that reached deals will reverse course.",
      "\"You have a bunch of decision-makers who are so used to being right or at least being told that they're right that they're going to be very reluctant to do what's necessary in order to win on this, which is change course on this and to admit that they messed up,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration is battling in court over its targeting of other firms. Before Wednesday's hearing on Perkins Coie, Trump took to social media and criticized Howell, the judge in the case (though he wrongly claimed he filed the lawsuit, when it was Perkins Coie that took that action).",
      "Lawson, the Justice Department lawyer in the case, came in for criticism from Howell for not having what she described as \"pretty basic\" information about the deals other law firms had reached. Lawson answered her questions with phrases like \u201cI don\u2019t have any insight\u201d or said he wasn't \u201cprivy to the details of these agreements, so I can\u2019t say one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Howell also said the Justice Department and the Office of Management and Budget threw the equivalent of \"a temper tantrum\" when they added extra language to a court-ordered message about her previous temporary restraining order to executive agencies. Attorney General Pam Bondi and OMB Director Russell Vought wrote that the government \"reserves the right to take all necessary and legal actions in response to the \u2018dishonest and dangerous\u2019 conduct of Perkins Coie LLP, as set forth in Executive Order 14230.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt struck me as a temper tantrum of the Justice Department and OMB,\" Howell said. \"It\u2019s worthy of a 3-year-old, not the DOJ.\u201d",
      "When Howell asked whether the president's targeting firms over their representation was a throwback to McCarthyism and the \"Red Scare\" era, Lawson said it wasn't. That was because there was individual review, he said, although he couldn't provide any details about how the individualized review would proceed, including what stage it was at and what parts of the government were conducting it.",
      "Dane Butswinkas, an attorney at Williams & Connolly who is representing Perkins Coie, said some of the government's arguments suggesting Trump's executive orders targeting law firms were more than an act of vengeance \u2014 they were \u201ca complete ruse\u201d and \u201ca sham.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to check our common sense like it\u2019s a hat at the door when we come into the courthouse,\u201d Butswinkas said. \"Saying it doesn't make it so.\""

      "D.R. Horton, a major national homebuilder, lowered its outlook for the year last week but reassured investors that it\u2019s \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to handle cost impacts from the trade war. Some smaller developers, meanwhile, warn they don\u2019t have much wiggle room.",
      "\u201cSince January, it seems like every month I\u2019ve been getting letters from suppliers making me aware that material costs are going up,\u201d said Joshua Correa, owner of Divinio Homes, a residential building firm in Dallas.",
      "Correa said he recently asked his lender for extended financing in case project costs rise unexpectedly or his properties sit on the market longer than usual, adding that some newly built homes already do. He also said he has been fielding unusually pointed questions lately about trade impacts on the housing market, like \u201cWhere does the wood flooring come from \u2014 which country? Will it be affected by tariffs?\u201d",
      "Every month I\u2019ve been getting letters from suppliers making me aware that material costs are going up.",
      "Joshua Correa, owner of Divinio Homes, Dallas",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a psychological impact on our buyers, our investors,\u201d Correa said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much decision-making.\u201d",
      "Some housing market pressures are easing. The NBC News Home Buyer Index \u2014 which measures the relative ease of finding and purchasing a home in more than 1,000 counties nationwide \u2014 shows difficulty levels declining in March, as competition and supply constraints cool off in many parts of the country.",
      "But some of those improvements reflect buyers\u2019 retreat from the market. The index\u2019s measure of economic instability, which shapes consumers\u2019 decisions around when and whether to spring for a home, rose to a two-year high last month. There are especially clear signs of a pullback in the South, with competition falling across broad swaths of central Texas and eastern Florida.",
      "By the end of January, Florida had more homes for sale than at any point since 2012, Redfin reported in late February, after a 23% surge in inventory from the year before. Newly built properties hit the market while buyers stayed away, turned off by steep prices and mortgage rates, intensifying weather threats and a related surge in insurance costs, Redfin said.",
      "Nationwide, weekly demand for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages plunged nearly 13%, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday, as average interest rates for the popular home loans rose to 6.90% from 6.81%.",
      "Not every builder is being affected in the same ways. Some are already grappling with major operational problems, while others are holding steady and signaling readiness to deal with some turbulence.",
      "Tommy Carter, a shop manager at Sexson Mechanical Co., a contracting firm in Greenwood, Indiana, said manufacturers are already flagging \u201ctariff surcharges on equipment we ordered before the tariff but [was] delivered after.\u201d",
      "He shared with NBC News several notices from suppliers, dated last week, alerting Sexson to price hikes from 2% to as much as 91% on parts like valves and other common components, citing 145% levies on China and Trump\u2019s 10% universal duty on foreign goods.",
      "Carter said contractors are \u201cscrambling\u201d to make purchases \u201cbefore the hammer comes down,\u201d adding that he expects some builds already underway to be halted in coming months because of prohibitive cost increases.",
      "For many industry players, even steep price hikes for certain materials can be manageable, as long as there aren\u2019t too many of them, said Tim Martin, who owns Oklahoma Royal Homes in Claremore, Oklahoma. An HVAC system might go up by $300, he said, but that\u2019s negligible in a million-dollar residential build.",
      "Denny Van Moorleghem, president of Regency Homes in the Omaha, Nebraska, area, voiced concerns about tariffs on Canadian lumber, but so far he isn\u2019t taking drastic action. Lumber remains temporarily exempted from Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada until the Commerce\u00a0Department concludes its review of those imports.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at fall, maybe, to be a problem for lumber,\u201d Van Moorleghem said. He\u2019s keeping home prices steady for now but said higher lumber tariffs could eventually add $10,000 to the price of a $500,000 property.",
      "Kirk, in Texas, said he\u2019s looking into sourcing more materials locally but waiting to see which tariffs stick. \u201cLong bells are ringing, but it\u2019s not this bottle on fire yet,\u201d he said.",
      "As some builders stockpile supplies, warehouse operators serving the industry stand to benefit, said Tim Negris, executive vice president of MOCA Systems, a construction services company. Higher warehousing demand could also spur construction of more storage space, even as builders pull back from putting up new homes.",
      "\u201cA lot of those builders are saying, \u2018Whoa, OK, let\u2019s just sell and fill in what we got and stockpile materials as is possible,\u2019\u201d Negris said. Apartment builders, who have already been facing tough market conditions, are especially eager to sock away supplies, he added.",
      "Basu also said the outlook for multifamily construction looks tough. \u201cIf the cost of building these products becomes more expensive, it makes it even less likely these projects move forward, at least in the near term,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "In an NFL draft season that has largely lacked drama or intrigue, one prospect has seemingly been making up for the dearth of storylines by himself.",
      "Shedeur Sanders, the former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback and son of football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, has been one of the most talked-about names headed into Thursday\u2019s event. That\u2019s without any sort of consensus on how serious his pro potential really is, with prognosticators speculating Sanders could be picked as high as No. 3 overall by the New York Giants, No. 9 by the New Orleans Saints or outside the first round entirely.",
      "And as much as Sanders has been scrutinized for his play on the field, he has also been picked apart off of it.",
      "One quarterbacks coach reportedly referred to Sanders as \u201cbrash\u201d and \u201carrogant.\u201d Another assistant coach told NFL Network that he was \u201centitled\u201d after what he described as \u201cthe worst formal interview\u201d he\u2019d ever been a part of.",
      "It\u2019s a narrative Sanders isn\u2019t paying any mind ahead of the draft.",
      "\u201cI truly don\u2019t have any space for negativity, so it doesn\u2019t play a factor in my life at all,\u201d Sanders told NBC News in April about the anonymous comments. \u201cI understand the easiest thing in the world to do is to be negative instead of positive. I truly don\u2019t care what people have to say.\u201d",
      "More from NFL Draft",
      "Cam Ward could be the most unlikely No. 1 NFL draft pick ever He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "Cam Ward could be the most unlikely No. 1 NFL draft pick ever",
      "He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "Sanders said that as the son of one of the NFL\u2019s most electric personalities, he feels prepared for noise surrounding him. And he hasn\u2019t been afraid to do things that attract attention, such as when he flexed his $70,000 watch at opponents and fans in a postgame celebration \u2014 a move a number of pros have emulated.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy everything is happening this way. I like a lot of chaos, because it shows you who\u2019s really there,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing, because this adds to the story. People hating on a kid for no reason. I don\u2019t get in trouble off the field. So you understand what it\u2019s really about.\u201d",
      "As far as his actual quarterbacking is concerned, Sanders is a tricky projection. In his two years with the Buffaloes, he threw for 64 touchdowns and in his senior year completed 74% of his passes. But he also took 94 sacks over the last two seasons, perhaps a sign that he\u2019s often holding on to the ball for too long.",
      "Still, Sanders was ultimately a key member in turning Colorado around from a one-win team the year before he arrived in 2022 to a nine-win team in 2024.",
      "To help navigate the draft process, Sanders has leaned on some past quarterbacks who\u2019ve been more than willing to help advise him. He said Michael Vick, Byron Leftwich and Robert Griffin III are among those he has spoken to in anticipation of his NFL career.",
      "\u201cA lot of African American former quarterbacks that all understand what\u2019s going on in society and just being big brothers for me,\u201d he said. \u201cLeaning on those relationships whenever things get tough. They help me get through whatever I need to get through.\u201d",
      "Once the draft begins Thursday night, where Sanders is picked will be one of the most dramatic moments of the telecast. But he said not to expect a big show of emotion when he\u2019s finally selected.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just something that comes with playing the caliber of football I played,\u201d Sanders says, adding he\u2019ll be more excited to see where some of his friends land. \u201cI feel like this is supposed to happen. If it was a big surprise to me, then I wouldn\u2019t feel like I earned it. That\u2019s what will be on my mind.\u201d",
      "And what if Sanders does go third overall to the Giants, dropping him in New York and a city desperate for a good quarterback?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a quarterback that will ever be prepared for that more than I am.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A group of protesters is planning to set up tent encampments on Columbia University campuses this week in protest of the war in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the planning and a recording of a meeting to plan the action shared with NBC News.",
      "The planned encampments come just over a year after students first erected about 50 tents on a university lawn to protest the war and drew the world's attention.",
      "Those demonstrations, in part, fueled the Trump administration's effort to extract concessions from Columbia, saying the university failed to quell antisemitism on its campus.",
      "Planning for the encampments has been shrouded in secrecy.",
      "The coordinating meeting took place at a community center on Tuesday night in Brooklyn\u2019s Bushwick neighborhood, approximately 12 miles from campus, according to screenshots of Signal messages from organizers and a person who was at the meeting.",
      "Invitations for the meeting were largely distributed in person or verbally over the phone, according to the person who attended the meeting and asked not to be named due to fears of discipline from the school.",
      "More than 100 people were present at the gathering and all wore masks to conceal their identities, according to the person. It is unclear if all of the participants were Columbia students, the person said.",
      "The student organizers did not introduce speakers by name and instead used Signal usernames and code names \u2014 including the beloved Pok\u00e9mon \u201cSquirtle\u201d and words such as \u201cbutterfly\u201d \u2014 to distinguish one another, according to the recording.",
      "Organizers have also refrained from referring to the upcoming encampments as \"encampments,\" according to screenshots of Signal messages from the organizers and conversations with two people familiar with the planning for the protests. In writing, and verbally, participants have designated the encampments with a code name, the \u201ccircus.\"",
      "Organizers asked demonstrators not to arrive on campus wearing masks on the days of the protests, which they said could alert campus security officers, according to the recording.",
      "\u201cThis year feels so much more organized and careful,\u201d the person who was at the meeting said.",
      "Columbia did not confirm or deny whether it knew about the upcoming protests.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on protecting the safety of our community and ensuring that the University is able to proceed normally with all academic activities,\" a university spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are closely monitoring, as always, for any disruptions, and campus activities are currently proceeding as usual.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that encampments are against the university's policies and participation could result in disciplinary action.",
      "In a statement, the school's public safety division said it would immediately try to remove tents or other structures, restrict access to the affected areas and possibly implement other restrictions to campus access.",
      "Participants will also be told to disperse. \"Individuals who refuse to disperse will be identified and sanctions, including potential removal from campus and possible arrest, may be applied,\" the public safety division said.",
      "Students are planning to erect an encampment on Thursday at the university's main campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights neighborhood and a second encampment on Friday at the university's nearby Manhattanville campus, according to the recording.",
      "\"When we take over the lawn, our goal is to unify the space and make it our own,\" one of the organizers said, according to the recording.",
      "Thursday\u2019s encampment was planned to start at 1 p.m. on the West Butler Lawn of the university\u2019s main campus, where encampments were set up last year, according to the recording, and disperse before nightfall or before police enter the campus.",
      "There will be a second encampment that is expected to be more robust and begin the next day. It is unclear when the Friday encampment will begin, but according to the recording, students plan to stay indefinitely and expect arrests to be made.",
      "Organizers chose to stage Friday's encampment at the Manhattanville campus \u2014 the site of the university's business school \u2014 because it is not gated off to outsiders, unlike the main campus, according to a person who attended the meeting.",
      "A speaker at the meeting also said that the site of the second encampment was aimed at protesting the university's gentrification of Harlem, according to the recording.",
      "\"Any action that we do will bring police, will bring repression and we thought about that deeply and we're aware of that,\" a speaker at the meeting said to applause. \"And we're stuck in this situation where inaction is also violence.\"",
      "Organizers of the upcoming protests have distributed several guidelines, obtained by NBC News, to student protesters. These guidelines cover legal risks associated with protesting, best practices for encounters with law enforcement and strategies for securing their digital presence.",
      "The document on digital security advises that students communicate only through encrypted messaging services such as Signal, over the phone, or in person. It also suggests that students turn off Wi-Fi on their phones while protesting to avoid being traced by the university.",
      "Another form shared by the organizers and obtained by NBC News asks students to provide \"all the information necessary to support your legal defense\" for their emergency contacts in the event of  arrest.",
      "It asks for student protesters to list any medical conditions, insurance information, prescriptions, if they have dependents, where their government IDs are, their address and how emergency contacts can access their apartments or homes.",
      "\"Given the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to pursuing federal action against pro-Palestine protestors and the abduction of our comrade Mahmoud Khalil, we are now asking students to prepare not only for potential arrest and jail for several hours or overnight, but for the possibility of prolonged jail time,\" the form reads. \"Give serious thought to the question of how you would prepare for weeks or months in jail.\"",
      "The upcoming encampments precede a monthslong campaign of protests at the university last year, which inspired similar demonstrations at college campuses across the country and around the world. Dozens of students who participated in the encampments were arrested by local authorities or expelled from the university.",
      "The protests were prompted by the Israeli military\u2019s response to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israel. More than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza and millions have been displaced in the war that followed, according to health officials in Gaza.",
      "Student activists staged the demonstrations last year in an attempt to get their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government.",
      "The encampments also come amid the Trump administration's push to intervene in Columbia's affairs and some of the nation's oldest higher education institutions. The federal government\u00a0canceled the university\u2019s federal grants\u00a0on March 7, part of what the Trump administration says is a broader effort to \u201croot out\u201d antisemitism on college campuses.",
      "In an effort to restore the grants, which fund dozens of universities' top-tier research expeditions, Columbia agreed to a list of the administration's demands on March 21.",
      "The demands included instituting a mask ban at protests in most cases; hiring an outsider to oversee its department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; committing to \"greater institutional neutrality\"; and enlisting three dozen new security officers with newly installed powers to arrest students.",
      "Faced with its own deal by the Trump administration, Harvard University rejected the administration's demands and sued the administration several days later, aiming to restore billions in funding.",
      "The protests also come several weeks after federal immigration officials\u00a0apprehended at least three Columbia students\u00a0who participated in the student-led protests, including 30-year-old\u00a0Mahmoud Khalil."

      "A federal judge blocked officials Wednesday from moving a Palestinian student from Columbia University who was taken into custody during his naturalization interview in Vermont.",
      "U.S. District Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford extended a previous temporary restraining order that keeps the student, Mohsen Mahdawi, in the state, where he is a resident. Mahdawi is being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Vermont.",
      "Lawyers for Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, had filed a motion for his release, arguing that he is not a flight risk.",
      "\u201cMr. Mahdawi has deep community ties, a long history of being actively invested in the peace process, and nearly 80 individuals who can attest to his character,\u201d the filing said.",
      "However, Crawford declined to rule whether the federal government can continue to detain Mahdawi, or whether the court has jurisdiction over his habeas petition challenging his detention. The judge set a hearing for next week, at which he could decide to release him.",
      "Mahdawi, who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and is a U.S. permanent resident, was taken into custody last week by armed agents from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Mahdawi walked into what he thought was the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of the long pathway to citizenship, raising his right hand, answering questions and signing a document that \u201che was willing to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America,\u201d his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "\u201cIt was a trap. At approximately 12:00 P.M., the USCIS official informed Mr. Mahdawi that he needed to \u2018check\u2019 on some information and would be right back,\u201d the court filings said. \u201cICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled Mr. Mahdawi.\u201d",
      "Following the brief hearing Wednesday, Mahdawi said he did not want his supporters to lose hope and called on people to \u201cbelieve in the inevitability of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis hearing is part of the system of democracy; it prevents a tyrant from having unchecked power. I am in prison, but I am not imprisoned,\u201d Mahdawi said in the statement. \u201cA system of democracy guarantees freedom of speech, speaking of Palestine does not only qualify as freedom of speech, but it is also about our humanity. Keep the hope alive; I will see you under the sun.\u201d",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s attorney, Cyrus Mehta, accused the Trump Administration of being \"hellbent on detaining these students and treating them like criminals simply for exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\"",
      "\u201cWe will continue to fight for Mohsen to be rightfully returned to his community in Vermont,\" Mehta said in a statement.",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin did not comment on the temporary restraining order or elaborate on Mahdawi's case. But she said in a statement that it is a \u201cprivilege\u201d to be granted a visa or green card.",
      "\u201cWhen you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "In the DHS notice for Mahdawi to appear, officials said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had \u201cdetermined that your presence and activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,\u201d the court filing said.",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s attorneys have said that the government\u2019s actions are retaliatory.",
      "\u201cPrior to and following Mr. Mahdawi\u2019s detention, the government has made clear that it intends to retaliate and punish individuals such as Mr. Mahdawi who advocated for ceasefire and ending the bloodshed in Gaza,\u201d their filing said. \u201cRespondents\u2019 actions plainly violate the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Mahdawi grew up in the al-Fara\u2019a refugee camp, where he witnessed Israeli military violence, according to court filings. At 15, the documents said, he was shot in the leg by an Israeli soldier. Mahdawi, who immigrated to the U.S. over a decade ago before attending Columbia University in 2021, became a key organizer of pro-Palestinian protests at the school last year.",
      "\u201cHe gave speeches at several of these protests. In these speeches, Mr. Mahdawi advocated for respect for international law, a permanent ceasefire, and a peaceful resolution that affirmed the human dignity of all,\u201d the court filings say.",
      "While Mahdawi lives in the U.S., much of his family still remains in the refugee camp, and Israeli authorities have repeatedly harassed them because of his advocacy, the filing says.",
      "\u201cMr. Mahdawi is fearful that, if he loses his lawful permanent resident status and he is removed to the West Bank, he will experience the same harassment, detention, and torture that his family has experienced, and would be in even more danger in light of the campaigns that have targeted and spread lies about him,\u201d\u00a0 the filing said.",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s case has prompted widespread criticism of the Trump administration and its stance on free speech. On Monday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., visited Mahdawi at the ICE facility.",
      "\u201cI want to tell everyone that I feel so loved and so supportive, and I am here in good hands,\" Mahdawi told Welch during the meeting. \u201cI am centered, I am clear, I am grounded, and I don\u2019t want you to worry about me. I want you to continue working for the democracy of this country and for humanity.\u201d"

    "summary": "The \"Up in Smoke\" comedy legends team up in a new documentary, 'Cheech and Chong's Last Movie,\" and share in an interview how comedy can still be transgressive and relevant.",
    "story": [
      "It was almost half a century ago that Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong teamed up for the first time on screen and told a lighthearted story about two pot-smoking buddies on a road trip.",
      "Over time, the 1978 movie \"Up in Smoke\" became a cult classic that transformed the two comedians and actors from hippie outsiders to comedy icons.",
      "Now, longtime Cheech and Chong fans or those who want to know more about them can see Marin and Chong reunite on screen in \u201cCheech & Chong\u2019s Last Movie,\u201d released nationwide Friday. Directed by David Bushell, the documentary weaves never-before-seen footage from Marin and Chong as the two take another road trip \u2014 this time spanning five decades of their ultimately widely successful careers spanning platinum albums and box-office fame.",
      "\u201cThey found the essence of Cheech and Chong. And that itself is worth exploring, because there\u2019s a Cheech and Chong in everybody,\u201d Chong said about the documentary in a joint video interview with Marin. \"That\u2019s who we are; we\u2019re everybody out there. And that\u2019s why people can relate to us.\u201d",
      "For many fans today, stoner comedy invites them into playful spaces that use humor to blur or soften social boundaries. \"Up in Smoke\" helped create and popularize a subgenre of later hits like \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High,\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d \u201cHarold & Kumar Go to White Castle\u201d and \u201cPineapple Express,\u201d among many others.",
      "But when it first came out, Cheech and Chong's \"Up in Smoke\" was certainly not a hit with everyone.",
      "\u201cAny film that asks you to go smashed before you see it must have something really bad to hide,\u201d the late Chicago-based film critic Gene Siskel said on his award-winning movie review TV show \u201cSiskel & Ebert.\u201d",
      "Siskel picked \u201cUp in Smoke\u201d as a \u201cDog of the Week\u201d \u2014\u00a0his choice for worst film \u2014 and criticized its dialogue, saying it was \"80 minutes of two jerks saying nothing but \u2018hey man.\u2019\u201d",
      "Yet those two casual words, \u201chey man,\u201d would nevertheless resonate with many fans and signal a generational change in mainstream culture.",
      "\u201cIn their sleepy, unshaven way, Cheech and Chong constitute a visual affront to the straight world just by walking down Main Street,\u201d\u00a0a 1978 New York Times review said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a revolution without danger, however, because, as the movie\u2019s popularity shows, this particular revolution has already been won. The true eccentrics are no longer Cheech and Chong but the clean\u2010shaven nitwits, like the cops in \u2018Up in Smoke,\u2019 who persist in their attempts to uphold repressive traditions.\u201d",
      "Frederick Luis Aldama, a pop and Latino culture scholar who is the Jacob & Frances Sanger Mossiker Chair in the Humanities\u00a0at the University of Texas, Austin, said in a phone interview that \u201cif you really distill it, stoner comedy is a great equalizer. It puts the doormat out for everyone to generally enter that place. And it\u2019s a reminder for a time and space where you can be yourself, let yourself go.\u201d",
      "Aldama remembers seeing \u201cUp in Smoke\u201d with his maternal \u201cabuelita\u201d (grandmother). He remembers her \u201claughing uproariously\u201d throughout the film, which made him laugh, too.",
      "It also gave him a sense of pride as a Latino, he said. Marin grew up in East Los Angeles, the son of Mexican American parents; his father was a World War II Navy veteran and a Los Angeles policeman. Chong grew up in Calgary, the son of a\u00a0Canadian mother with Scottish and Irish roots and a Chinese father.",
      "The comedians, Aldama said, brought elements such as Mexican American lowrider culture into the mainstream, for example, but \u201cthey did it in a way where you weren\u2019t asked to judge or laugh at it, but simply enjoy it and laugh with it. And this put a positive spotlight on our communities, our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Marin's and Chong's childhoods were separated by more than 1,500 miles, and different circumstances would ultimately bring them together in an unexpected way.",
      "Marin dodged the Vietnam War by moving to Canada. And Chong, who had been a guitarist for Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers, said he lost his job in Motown.",
      "\u201cI was just trying to get my life back together. And Cheech was trying to live with the fact that he had to live in Canada. And then we met,\u201d said Chong, 86. \u201cWe realized that we had this understanding.\u201d",
      "The seed for their understanding was planted at a\u00a0Vancouver topless nightclub where Chong was a part-owner and had formed a hippie-burlesque comedy troupe. Marin would join the group as a writer. And then, the duo continued to develop their stoner act even after the troupe folded.",
      "After years of success, the two went their own ways, and they have some frank discussions in the documentary about their relationship.",
      "Asked whether comedy could still be transgressive, Marin says it can, as long as there is an authentic connection between the comedian and the audience.",
      "\u201cIt depends upon the right comedy and if it\u2019s truthful comedy. It\u2019s not the comedy that wants to please everybody. We want to please ourselves. And in doing so, [we] do something that\u2019s relevant for the people,\u201d said Marin, who's 78. \"I think that will keep happening, absolutely.\"",
      "But for comedy to succeed today, Chong said, it can\u2019t simply repeat what was done in the past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living, like, in a travelogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer in the \u201960s, the \u201970s or the \u201980s or the \u201990s. We\u2019re now. And so, in order to stay relevant, you got to acknowledge what\u2019s going on now. Because we're alive and we're still breathing, we can still think about it.\u201d",
      "Asked whether this was really their \"last\" movie and what would get them together on screen again, Marin said, \"Very easy, money!\"",
      "\"No, we're going to keep hammering until they take the cold, warm bong out of my hand,\" Chong said, as the two men laughed."

      "As part of his remake, Trump picked Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative culture warrior who represented him in challenging the results of the 2020 election and backed his baseless claims of voter fraud, to lead the office. Ten current and former employees of the office, as well as other sources familiar with the Justice Department\u2019s operations, who spoke to NBC News, claim Dhillon has forced out a majority of career managers, caused others to resign and led a 180-degree shift in the direction of the department from its original mission: enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination in hiring, housing and voting rights.",

      "Still, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave conflicting accounts of the state of negotiations Wednesday, with Bessent saying \u201cboth sides are waiting to speak to the other,\u201d without providing further detail. The secretary reiterated remarks he made the previous day, predicting near-term de-escalation."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A liberal group will launch a media campaign Thursday targeting law firms that reached deals with President Donald Trump to avoid being targeted by executive orders as the deals come under intense scrutiny within the legal community and Trump's orders face legal inquiries.",
      "\"Big law, stop bending the knee,\" reads a poster from the \"Big Law Cowards\" campaign by the liberal nonprofit group Demand Justice. The group says the ads will be wheatpasted strategically around Washington on Thursday near the locations of the firms that have reached deals with the administration. The group will also have a mobile billboard circulating with ads criticizing the firms, along with a broader digital campaign.",
      "The judicial branch is pushing back against other executive orders targeting firms that didn\u2019t reach deals with the Trump administration \u2014 and the firms that did make deals are managing both internal and external fallout from their decisions.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell grilled Justice Department lawyer Richard Lawson about the executive order against Perkins Coie, one of the law firms that refused to reach a deal with the Trump administration and sued it, instead.",
      "Maggie Jo Buchanan, the interim executive director of Demand Justice, told NBC News that her group hoped to highlight the need for the powerful to act in support of the values of the legal profession, defend the rule of law and support American values.",
      "\u201cWhen you see some of the most powerful law firms in the country, if not the world, unwilling to stand up to the administration when ordinary people are speaking out, we think it\u2019s really important to shine a bright light on that and really show that ordinary people demand that those most powerful speak out against the administration and not bend the knee,\u201d she said.",
      "Nine firms have reached deals with Trump: A&O Shearman; Kirkland; Latham & Watkins; Simpson Thacher; Cadwalader; Milbank; Skadden; Willkie; and Paul Weiss. The Demand Justice campaign will highlight those firms and the amounts they have pledged in free legal work, which total nearly $1 billion.",
      "Buchanan said that law firm employees who decided to walk away from their positions at those firms had shown \"real bravery\" and that it was important to highlight those who took a bold stance.",
      "\"It takes a lot to walk away from a very lucrative position,\" she said. \"But I think what we're really seeing is people sticking by their principles and being willing to speak out, not only against their employer, their former employer, but really stand up for the rule of law.\"",
      "Rachel Cohen, a former associate at Skadden who quit in protest last month before the firm reached a deal, told NBC News that the response to her decision to speak out has been \"overwhelming\" and that resignations from other firms have continued to roll in, including those of some people who chose to leave their firms quietly. Cohen said she hopes partners at the firms that reached deals will reverse course.",
      "\"You have a bunch of decision-makers who are so used to being right or at least being told that they're right that they're going to be very reluctant to do what's necessary in order to win on this, which is change course on this and to admit that they messed up,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration is battling in court over its targeting of other firms. Before Wednesday's hearing on Perkins Coie, Trump took to social media and criticized Howell, the judge in the case (though he wrongly claimed he filed the lawsuit, when it was Perkins Coie that took that action).",
      "Lawson, the Justice Department lawyer in the case, came in for criticism from Howell for not having what she described as \"pretty basic\" information about the deals other law firms had reached. Lawson answered her questions with phrases like \u201cI don\u2019t have any insight\u201d or said he wasn't \u201cprivy to the details of these agreements, so I can\u2019t say one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Howell also said the Justice Department and the Office of Management and Budget threw the equivalent of \"a temper tantrum\" when they added extra language to a court-ordered message about her previous temporary restraining order to executive agencies. Attorney General Pam Bondi and OMB Director Russell Vought wrote that the government \"reserves the right to take all necessary and legal actions in response to the \u2018dishonest and dangerous\u2019 conduct of Perkins Coie LLP, as set forth in Executive Order 14230.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt struck me as a temper tantrum of the Justice Department and OMB,\" Howell said. \"It\u2019s worthy of a 3-year-old, not the DOJ.\u201d",
      "When Howell asked whether the president's targeting firms over their representation was a throwback to McCarthyism and the \"Red Scare\" era, Lawson said it wasn't. That was because there was individual review, he said, although he couldn't provide any details about how the individualized review would proceed, including what stage it was at and what parts of the government were conducting it.",
      "Dane Butswinkas, an attorney at Williams & Connolly who is representing Perkins Coie, said some of the government's arguments suggesting Trump's executive orders targeting law firms were more than an act of vengeance \u2014 they were \u201ca complete ruse\u201d and \u201ca sham.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to check our common sense like it\u2019s a hat at the door when we come into the courthouse,\u201d Butswinkas said. \"Saying it doesn't make it so.\""

      "Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Young Kim, R-Calif., have been collecting signatures for the letter, which was first obtained by NBC News and is backed by more than 100 House members. The letter will be sent to Bondi on Thursday.",
      "In February, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Violence Against Women removed\u00a0all notices of grant opportunities for fiscal year 2025 from its website, sparking alarm from nonprofit groups that provide services to abuse victims, Politico reported.",
      "\u201cWe write to express our deep concern about reports that the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) has withdrawn its Notice of 2025 Funding Opportunities. OVW administers critical grant programs that provide lifesaving support to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cThe sudden withdrawal of these funding opportunities threatens to disrupt essential services, jeopardize the stability of victim assistance programs, and undermine the bipartisan commitment to combating these forms of violence,\u201d it continues. \u201cWe respectfully urge the Department of Justice to clarify the status of these grants as soon as possible and take swift action to ensure funding remains available to support survivors and the organizations that serve them.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The letter is a rare bipartisan rebuke of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of federal funding. Gottheimer is running for governor of New Jersey this year, while Kim is a moderate Republican from Southern California who faces a tough re-election fight next year.",
      "Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, also signed on to the letter. The signers also include two Republican delegates to the House, Kimberlyn King-Hinds of the Northern Mariana Islands and Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen of American Samoa.",
      "Other Democrats helping with the effort are Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, a member of the party's leadership in the House, and Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin.",
      "The Office on Violence Against Women was created through the Violence Against Women Act, a bipartisan law known as VAWA, which administers grant programs that provide services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking.",
      "VAWA was signed into law in 1994 and reauthorized several times, most recently in 2022. Democrats have pointed out that at her Senate confirmation hearing, Bondi vowed to \u201cfaithfully implement these programs\u201d and \u201censure that all programs administered by the Department, including those at OVW, are administered effectively and in accordance with their missions as enacted by Congress.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote in their letter: \u201cA delay or reduction in OVW funding will have devastating consequences for the countless individuals who rely on these resources for safety, legal protection, and recovery. This abrupt withdrawal of funding has created severe uncertainty that threatens the well-being of survivors who cannot afford these delays.",
      "\u201cWe ask that the Department clarify its plans to rectify this situation and ensure that OVW grant funding is fully restored without further delay to continue providing care to survivors of domestic violence.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "CHICAGO \u2014 With his massive frame and larger-than-life persona, Steve McMichael was natural for the gridiron and the squared circle.",
      "The man known as \u201cMongo\u201d and \u201cMing The Merciless\u201d left a trail of battered and beaten opponents during a Hall of Fame career with the Chicago Bears. Then he did the same as a professional wrestler.",
      "McMichael, a star defensive tackle on the Bears\u2019 famed 1985 Super Bowl championship team who remained a fixture in the Windy City for decades, died Wednesday following a battle with ALS. He was 67.",
      "McMichael died at Lightways Hospice in suburban Joliet, his publicist, Betsy Shepherd, told The Associated Press.",
      "An All-Pro in 1985 and 1987, McMichael was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2024. He played in a franchise-record 191 consecutive games from 1981 to 1993 and ranks second to Richard Dent on the Bears\u2019 career sacks list with 92 1/2. His final NFL season was with Green Bay in 1994.",
      "McMichael\u2019s brash personality and willingness to say whatever was on his mind made him a perfect fit for pro wrestling. He began working for World Championship Wrestling in the 1990s at the height of the \u201cMonday Night Wars\u201d with the World Wrestling Federation, starting as a color commentator and later joining Ric Flair in the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d group.",
      "McMichael revealed in April 2021 that he was battling ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, which affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control.",
      "\u201cI promise you, this epitaph that I\u2019m going to have on me now? This ain\u2019t ever how I envisioned this was going to end,\u201d McMichael told the Chicago Tribune.",
      "McMichael had been experiencing tingling in his arms for some time that he figured was a neck or spine issue stemming from his playing days or his work as a wrestler. A neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic suggested in September 2020 that he had ALS. McMichael sought other opinions, and in January 2021, doctors in Chicago confirmed the diagnosis.",
      "Though he mostly retreated from public life following his announcement, photos posted on social media by family and friends showed his decline. McMichael went from a 270-pound giant who used to blast through blockers and drive wrestlers headfirst into the mat with the \u201cMongo spike\u201d to someone who was rail-thin, bedridden and hooked up to machines as his body failed him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s scared to die and he shouldn\u2019t be because he\u2019s the most badass man I\u2019ve ever known inside and out,\u201d his wife, Misty McMichael, told The Associated Press prior to his Hall of Fame induction on Aug. 3, 2024. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s gonna be in heaven before any of us, so I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s afraid of. But I\u2019ve told him to please hang on \u2018til the (induction) and then, you know, I don\u2019t want to see him suffer anymore. He\u2019s been suffering.\u201d",
      "Born in Houston, McMichael\u2019s parents separated when he was about 2. His mom, Betty, married an oil company executive named E.V. McMichael, and the younger McMichael considered him his dad and took on his surname.",
      "The family moved to Freer, Texas, and McMichael went on to letter in football, basketball, baseball, track, tennis and golf as a senior. A catcher, he preferred baseball. The Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals showed interest, but his parents wanted him to go to college.",
      "He received recruiting letters for football from about 75 schools. Bear Bryant wanted to use him as a tight end at Alabama, while Darrell Royal recruited him to Texas as a defensive end. McMichael went on to star for the Longhorns from 1976-79. Although his freshman season was marred by the death of his stepfather, he became a consensus first-team All-American as a senior and entered the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010.",
      "The New England Patriots drafted McMichael in the third round in 1980. He didn\u2019t last long, appearing in six games as a rookie before getting released prior to his second season. McMichael would play hard on and off the field, getting in fights in practice and taking in Boston\u2019s nightlife afterward.",
      "\u201cThey looked at me and said, \u2018Steve, we think you\u2019re the criminal element in the league. Get out,\u2019\u201d McMichael said in his Gridiron Greats Hall of Fame induction speech in 2019.",
      "The same traits that apparently led to a ticket out of New England were welcomed in Chicago. In that same speech, McMichael recalled walking into founder George Halas\u2019 office \u2014 \u201cIt was like I was walking into a 1920 gangster movie and he was James Cagney\u201d \u2014 when he signed with Chicago.",
      "\u201cPapa Bear\u201d made it clear. \u201cYou know what he said to me, guys?\u201d McMichael said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard what kind of dirty rat you are in practice. Don\u2019t change, Steve.\u201d",
      "His nasty demeanor and oversized personality made McMichael one of the most feared players on arguably the greatest defense ever assembled. But longtime friend Dave Siden remembered him as master storyteller and a generous man who would sign over his preseason paychecks to the team trainers as a token of appreciation and buy baskets of toys for children. Through McMichael, Siden met golfer Ben Crenshaw and went backstage at wrestling events.",
      "\u201cI knew him as one of the nicest, most giving friends you could have,\u201d Siden said, his voice cracking.",
      "McMichael played alongside Hall of Famers Dent, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton, and the 1985 Bears, led by their dominant defense, shuffled their way to the franchise\u2019s lone Super Bowl championship. McMichael was an All-Pro that season with eight sacks.",
      "He played 15 years in the NFL \u2014 13 with Chicago before his final season with the rival Packers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cruel irony that the Bears\u2019 Ironman succumbed to this dreaded disease,\u201d Bears chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \u201cYet Steve showed us throughout his struggle that his real strength was internal, and he demonstrated on a daily basis his class, his dignity and his humanity. He is at peace now. We offer our condolences to Misty, (daughter) Macy, the rest of Steve\u2019s family, his teammates, and countless friends and fans of a great Bear.\u201d",
      "Pro Football Hall of Fame president and CEO Jim Porter said in a statement: \u201cSteve McMichael told everyone he would fight ALS with the same tenacity he showed for 15 seasons in the National Football League. And he did just that. Everyone who played with or against Steve shares the same opinion: No one battled longer or harder from the snap until the whistle than Steve the player.\u201d",
      "Soon after his career ended, McMichael got involved with wrestling.",
      "In April 1995, he was in Lawrence Taylor\u2019s corner at the WWF\u2019s WrestleMania when the New York Giants great met Bam Bam Bigelow. Later that year, he started with WCW as a commentator.",
      "McMichael began his in-ring career in 1996, feuding with Flair over then-wife Debra McMichael, then a wrestling valet. He remained with the company through 1999.",
      "\u201cThe World Just Lost The Incredible Steve \u2018Mongo\u2019 McMichael!\u201d Flair posted on X. \u201cHe Was My Best Friend Through It All! An Amazing Athlete And Human Being!\u201d",

      "In an NFL draft season that has largely lacked drama or intrigue, one prospect has seemingly been making up for the dearth of storylines by himself.",
      "Shedeur Sanders, the former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback and son of football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, has been one of the most talked-about names headed into Thursday\u2019s event. That\u2019s without any sort of consensus on how serious his pro potential really is, with prognosticators speculating Sanders could be picked as high as No. 3 overall by the New York Giants, No. 9 by the New Orleans Saints or outside the first round entirely.",
      "And as much as Sanders has been scrutinized for his play on the field, he has also been picked apart off of it.",
      "One quarterbacks coach reportedly referred to Sanders as \u201cbrash\u201d and \u201carrogant.\u201d Another assistant coach told NFL Network that he was \u201centitled\u201d after what he described as \u201cthe worst formal interview\u201d he\u2019d ever been a part of.",
      "It\u2019s a narrative Sanders isn\u2019t paying any mind ahead of the draft.",
      "\u201cI truly don\u2019t have any space for negativity, so it doesn\u2019t play a factor in my life at all,\u201d Sanders told NBC News in April about the anonymous comments. \u201cI understand the easiest thing in the world to do is to be negative instead of positive. I truly don\u2019t care what people have to say.\u201d",
      "More from NFL Draft",
      "Cam Ward could be the most unlikely No. 1 NFL draft pick ever He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",

      "He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "Sanders said that as the son of one of the NFL\u2019s most electric personalities, he feels prepared for noise surrounding him. And he hasn\u2019t been afraid to do things that attract attention, such as when he flexed his $70,000 watch at opponents and fans in a postgame celebration \u2014 a move a number of pros have emulated.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy everything is happening this way. I like a lot of chaos, because it shows you who\u2019s really there,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing, because this adds to the story. People hating on a kid for no reason. I don\u2019t get in trouble off the field. So you understand what it\u2019s really about.\u201d",
      "As far as his actual quarterbacking is concerned, Sanders is a tricky projection. In his two years with the Buffaloes, he threw for 64 touchdowns and in his senior year completed 74% of his passes. But he also took 94 sacks over the last two seasons, perhaps a sign that he\u2019s often holding on to the ball for too long.",
      "Still, Sanders was ultimately a key member in turning Colorado around from a one-win team the year before he arrived in 2022 to a nine-win team in 2024.",
      "To help navigate the draft process, Sanders has leaned on some past quarterbacks who\u2019ve been more than willing to help advise him. He said Michael Vick, Byron Leftwich and Robert Griffin III are among those he has spoken to in anticipation of his NFL career.",
      "\u201cA lot of African American former quarterbacks that all understand what\u2019s going on in society and just being big brothers for me,\u201d he said. \u201cLeaning on those relationships whenever things get tough. They help me get through whatever I need to get through.\u201d",
      "Once the draft begins Thursday night, where Sanders is picked will be one of the most dramatic moments of the telecast. But he said not to expect a big show of emotion when he\u2019s finally selected.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just something that comes with playing the caliber of football I played,\u201d Sanders says, adding he\u2019ll be more excited to see where some of his friends land. \u201cI feel like this is supposed to happen. If it was a big surprise to me, then I wouldn\u2019t feel like I earned it. That\u2019s what will be on my mind.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "New home sales are rising, but builders are tapping the brakes as the trade war and broader economic uncertainty grip the industry.",
      "Sales of new homes rose 7.4% from February to March, according to federal data released Wednesday, as buyers took advantage of somewhat lower mortgage rates and a wider supply of properties to choose from. But rates have already begun inching back up, and homebuilders are bracing for a slowdown ahead.",
      "Federal figures showed housing starts plunged more than 11% from February to March. Developers\u2019 six-month sales expectations slipped 4 percentage points from March to April, the National Association of Home Builders reported separately last week.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re being very selective of what you\u2019re working on right now with all the uncertainty in the marketplace,\u201d said John Kirk, founder of the Lightpath Company, a multifamily home developer in New Braunfels, Texas.",
      "Waiting and seeing is very bad for construction.",
      "Anirban Basu, chief economist, Associated Builders and Contractors",
      "The homebuilding industry isn\u2019t particularly vulnerable to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, but his mercurial trade policies are affecting its business nonetheless.",
      "Only 7% of materials used in new residential construction are imported, the NAHB estimates. Yet contractors and developers are already seeing higher materials costs and supply chain disruptions. With many vendors unable to guarantee price levels for the months ahead, some builders fear they can\u2019t rely on current cost estimates, making it harder to move projects beyond the planning phase. Consumers\u2019 growing reluctance to pounce on properties is adding to the strain, leaving more homes to pile up on the market.",
      "\u201cThe financial rationale to move forward with projects is no longer penciling out,\u201d said Anirban Basu, chief economist of the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group. \u201cWaiting and seeing is very bad for construction,\u201d he said, adding that he expects construction data to reveal a deeper slowdown by summer.",
      "D.R. Horton, a major national homebuilder, lowered its outlook for the year last week but reassured investors that it\u2019s \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to handle cost impacts from the trade war. Some smaller developers, meanwhile, warn they don\u2019t have much wiggle room.",
      "\u201cSince January, it seems like every month I\u2019ve been getting letters from suppliers making me aware that material costs are going up,\u201d said Joshua Correa, owner of Divinio Homes, a residential building firm in Dallas.",
      "Correa said he recently asked his lender for extended financing in case project costs rise unexpectedly or his properties sit on the market longer than usual, adding that some newly built homes already do. He also said he has been fielding unusually pointed questions lately about trade impacts on the housing market, like \u201cWhere does the wood flooring come from \u2014 which country? Will it be affected by tariffs?\u201d",
      "Every month I\u2019ve been getting letters from suppliers making me aware that material costs are going up.",
      "Joshua Correa, owner of Divinio Homes, Dallas",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a psychological impact on our buyers, our investors,\u201d Correa said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much decision-making.\u201d",
      "Some housing market pressures are easing. The NBC News Home Buyer Index \u2014 which measures the relative ease of finding and purchasing a home in more than 1,000 counties nationwide \u2014 shows difficulty levels declining in March, as competition and supply constraints cool off in many parts of the country.",
      "But some of those improvements reflect buyers\u2019 retreat from the market. The index\u2019s measure of economic instability, which shapes consumers\u2019 decisions around when and whether to spring for a home, rose to a two-year high last month. There are especially clear signs of a pullback in the South, with competition falling across broad swaths of central Texas and eastern Florida.",
      "By the end of January, Florida had more homes for sale than at any point since 2012, Redfin reported in late February, after a 23% surge in inventory from the year before. Newly built properties hit the market while buyers stayed away, turned off by steep prices and mortgage rates, intensifying weather threats and a related surge in insurance costs, Redfin said.",
      "Nationwide, weekly demand for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages plunged nearly 13%, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday, as average interest rates for the popular home loans rose to 6.90% from 6.81%.",
      "Not every builder is being affected in the same ways. Some are already grappling with major operational problems, while others are holding steady and signaling readiness to deal with some turbulence.",
      "Tommy Carter, a shop manager at Sexson Mechanical Co., a contracting firm in Greenwood, Indiana, said manufacturers are already flagging \u201ctariff surcharges on equipment we ordered before the tariff but [was] delivered after.\u201d",
      "He shared with NBC News several notices from suppliers, dated last week, alerting Sexson to price hikes from 2% to as much as 91% on parts like valves and other common components, citing 145% levies on China and Trump\u2019s 10% universal duty on foreign goods.",
      "Carter said contractors are \u201cscrambling\u201d to make purchases \u201cbefore the hammer comes down,\u201d adding that he expects some builds already underway to be halted in coming months because of prohibitive cost increases.",
      "For many industry players, even steep price hikes for certain materials can be manageable, as long as there aren\u2019t too many of them, said Tim Martin, who owns Oklahoma Royal Homes in Claremore, Oklahoma. An HVAC system might go up by $300, he said, but that\u2019s negligible in a million-dollar residential build.",
      "Denny Van Moorleghem, president of Regency Homes in the Omaha, Nebraska, area, voiced concerns about tariffs on Canadian lumber, but so far he isn\u2019t taking drastic action. Lumber remains temporarily exempted from Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada until the Commerce\u00a0Department concludes its review of those imports.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at fall, maybe, to be a problem for lumber,\u201d Van Moorleghem said. He\u2019s keeping home prices steady for now but said higher lumber tariffs could eventually add $10,000 to the price of a $500,000 property.",
      "Kirk, in Texas, said he\u2019s looking into sourcing more materials locally but waiting to see which tariffs stick. \u201cLong bells are ringing, but it\u2019s not this bottle on fire yet,\u201d he said.",
      "As some builders stockpile supplies, warehouse operators serving the industry stand to benefit, said Tim Negris, executive vice president of MOCA Systems, a construction services company. Higher warehousing demand could also spur construction of more storage space, even as builders pull back from putting up new homes.",
      "\u201cA lot of those builders are saying, \u2018Whoa, OK, let\u2019s just sell and fill in what we got and stockpile materials as is possible,\u2019\u201d Negris said. Apartment builders, who have already been facing tough market conditions, are especially eager to sock away supplies, he added.",
      "Basu also said the outlook for multifamily construction looks tough. \u201cIf the cost of building these products becomes more expensive, it makes it even less likely these projects move forward, at least in the near term,\u201d he said."

      "That allowed Brown, who trained as a paralegal, to begin a new life with his wife and two children in Connecticut, where he gave back to the community.",
      "\u201cI was able to come out, fortunately, from that hell. And when I came out, immediately I was able to work with justice-impact youth, from the ages of 16 to 24,\u201d Brown said.",
      "But Brown\u2019s world came crashing in on Christmas Eve 2024, when the Appellate Division reinstated the conviction on a legal technicality \u2014 meaning he would have to serve the remainder of the 40 years.",
      "Brown was supposed to turn himself in to Bronx Criminal Court on March 14, but got a temporary reprieve by the district attorney\u2019s office when he filed a clemency petition with New York. Gov. Kathy Hochul. The victims\u2019 families have opposed that petition, which is still being reviewed.",
      "\u201cThere are three victims in this case, I am the third victim no one ever speaks about, as I did not commit this crime,\u201d Brown told the I-Team. \u201cBut putting that aside at this time, I am no risk to society.\u201d",
      "There is considerable urgency to get an answer soon from the governor\u2019s office: A new deadline for Brown to turn himself in is on Friday.",
      "While the adjournment Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark agreed to runs out on Friday, Brown\u2019s attorneys on Wednesday filed a motion asking for more time to argue their case to the governor \u2014 and for the DA to re-sentence the former inmate.",

And Andre would not have gotten a 40-year sentence today for an attempted murder charge.\u201d",
      "The effort has gotten support from wrongfully convicted exonerees and the NAACP New York State Conference.",
      "Brown\u2019s face hid a jumble of emotions as the 48-year-old looked at the courthouse on Wednesday where he is supposed to surrender in two days to serve 17 more years in prison, tearing apart his family.",

      "Nikki Glaser's plan to joke about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet at the 2025 Golden Globes almost scared away Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet himself.",
      "The comedian hosted the awards show this past January, following her viral performance in last year's Netflix special \"The Roast of Tom Brady.\" Glaser garnered laughs from grilling the former Patriots quarterback, but while hosting the Golden Globes, she sensed another emotion from her audience: that of fear.",
      "\"I think, when I first walked out (to do the opening monologue), I knew the energy was like, 'We don't know what she's going to do. We've seen her do the Tom Brady roast, most recently,'\" Glaser said during a conversation at the Time100 Summit on April 23.",
      "Glaser said that she was aware that, specifically, Chalamet had concerns around her jokes \u2014 and for good reason.",
      "\"I did an interview before the Globes, and they were like, 'Who are you going to skewer?'\" she recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'Not really anyone. But, you know, in order to serve a compliment about a performance, I have to make a joke with it, so I would probably want to say something about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet because I just loved his performance in 'A Complete Unknown,' so I'll probably make a joke about him,'\" she continued.",
      "Little did she know those words would reach Chalamet's ears.",
      "\"And that got back to him, and he was just going to skip my monologue and get there late,\" Glaser said, adding that she more than understood that train of thought.",
      "\"He shouldn't have to sit there if I'm going to be like, make fun of something about him. It's like his night,\" she said of the actor, who was up for best performance by a male actor in a motion picture for playing Bob Dylan in \"A Complete Unknown.\"",
      "In an attempt to clear the air, she said she left a message for his publicist, saying that the \"jokes are only uplifting him\" and that she would \"never do anything to ruin his night.\"",
      "Luckily, her words did the trick and Chalamet was in the audience, seen sporting a smile while she cracked jokes about him.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Chalamet\u2019s team for comment and has not immediately heard back.",
      "Glaser has already been cleared to come back as host for the 2026 Golden Globes, and she feels optimistic that the vibes from the crowd will be different next year.",
      "\"Next time, it's going to be a lot more fun, because I think they know the tone that I have now, where it's like ... 'I'm not going to embarrass you. And if you laugh, I'm only going to make you look good, because you're going to look so relatable laughing,'\" she said.",
      "\"I'm giving them an opportunity to look like, you know, the stars are just like us.\""

      "Parents, hide your daughters: Joe Goldberg is coming back for a fifth and final season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cYou,\u201d and let\u2019s just say that no one is safe from the cage in the basement.",
      "Fans who\u2019ve been following \u201cYou\u201d (which is based on Caroline Kepnes\u2019 novels) for the last four seasons know that our pouty, floppy-haired protagonist Joe (Penn Badgley) seems like a real catch at first. He\u2019s handsome, he loves books, he\u2019s super-supportive of women (in his own particular way) \u2014 he\u2019s a wannabe hero with lots of family damage.",
      "But the other side to him is one giant red flag: He kind of likes killing people, and has a tendency to lock ladies who thwart or threaten him in a soundproofed, clear cage (which traditionally lives in the basement of a used bookstore).",
      "Season 5, which premieres April 24, is set to conclude Joe\u2019s adventures, which have included both a significant body count and an international tour of New York, London, Paris and Los Angeles, so expect a big blowout of some sort.",
      "\u201cEvery season they manage to find new space to make it interesting and relevant,\u201d Badgley told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog recently. \u201cAnd this season, I think somehow coming back to where it started allowed for it to just become grounded in the way that it needs to also have this kind of spectacular finish.\u201d",
      "So before the final ten episodes drop, let\u2019s jaunt back to 2023's Season 4. What was Joe\u2019s reign of terror in the UK like?",
      "Where was Joe at the start of Season 4?",
      "With his wife Love (Victoria Pedretti) dead and his daughter Henry parked with friends, Joe made it to London and somehow landed a job as a university professor, calling himself Jonathan Moore. He clicked with a few students, including Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman), who gave him a book from rising political figure Rhys Montrose (Ed Speleers).",
      "But it doesn\u2019t take long for Joe to slip, even when he\u2019s promising to be better. He loathed Malcolm (Stephen Hagan), who helped him secure the teaching position, and coveted Malcolm\u2019s art expert girlfriend Kate (Charlotte Ritchie).",
      "Both Malcolm and Kate were filthy rich, and after Joe saved Kate from being robbed (his stalking does come in handy once in a while), Joe was included in their inner circle of wealthy ne\u2019er-do-wells, influencers, and nepo babies. Why couldn\u2019t he just find a nice book club?",
      "Surrounded by jerks again, Joe reverted to form and bodies began to fall. He started getting text messages from the \u201cEat-the-Rich Killer.\u201d",
      "Joe initially thought the killer was Rhys Montrose \u2014 who he met and had a fine conversation with at a bar Kate and Malcolm\u2019s friends hung out at \u2014 but twist, Rhys wasn\u2019t real!",
      "That is, Rhys Montrose was real and an author/politician, but Joe\u2019s mind had begun playing tricks on him, creating an \u201cinner\u201d Rhys he could blame some of the murders on, like Malcolm\u2019s.",
      "So long, Marienne: Joe\u2019s flashback girlfriend",
      "Marienne (Tati Gabrielle) was the former librarian and single mom Joe tanked his relationship with Love for. At the end of Season 3, Love convinced Marienne to flee because of Joe\u2019s murderous tendencies, and after a stint in London, Marienne ended up in Paris with her daughter.",
      "Joe tracked her down, but when she threatened him with a knife \u2014 he let her go, insisting he could be a better person.",
      "Another mind-twist! In reality, Joe put her in his cage (which came with him to \u2026 London?) and left her there as his mind flapped between Good Joe and Bad Joe. But when Joe\u2019s nosy student Nadia discovered Marienne in the cage, the women contrived a way for Marienne to fake her death. Once Joe was sure Marienne had died in the cage, he decided to do something nice for her \u2026 and left her body on a bench to be discovered. But Nadia came along to wake her up and Marienne was free!",
      "Joe\u2019s next victim \u2014 er, girlfriend: Kate",
      "Kate did mourn Malcolm, but Joe slowly won her over, insisting (rightly so) that she should get away from her parasitical friend group. Over time, they revealed some of their dirty secrets to one another, and grew closer.",
      "But when Love popped up in Joe\u2019s dreams, he took a deeper look inside himself and realized he was the Eat-the-Rich killer, and that he had in fact kidnapped Marienne. The only way to end the cycle, he decided, was to end himself. He jumped into a river and was saved by police. In the hospital he came clean to Kate about his past, and no longer felt guilty about the occasional murder he had to commit. He was ready to start his life anew \u2014 with her.",
      "Kate helped Joe clean up his past, and they began a full-fledged love affair of damaged equals. But Nadia and another student, Eddie (Brad Alexander), were still investigating Joe and trying to expose him. So Joe killed Eddie and handed a shocked Nadia the murder weapon, effectively framing her. Nadia refused to speak in her own defense, and Kate and Joe walked away with clean hands, if not quite clean hearts.",
      "Season 5 of \"You\" returns to Netflix on April 24."

    "summary": "Author Emily Henry, who released \"Great Big Beautiful Life\" on April 22, shares how she's doing with the \"breakneck\" pace, how it feels seeing her books be adapted for TV and film and more.",
    "story": [
      "Author Emily Henry\u2019s career can perhaps best be described as a writer\u2019s dream.",
      "The 34-year-old has published 10 books since 2017, sold more than 9 million copies in the U.S., and secured a four-book deal in 2022 after her book \u201cBeach Read\u201d became a New York Times bestseller in the early months of the pandemic. After the release of her newest book, \u201cGreat Big Beautiful Life,\u201d on April 22, 2025, she has one more book to deliver on that deal (although she tells us it will not be her last).",
      "Five of her books are in the process of being adapted to film or TV series. The one she says is nearest completion is \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which is expected to be released on Netflix with Emily Bader and Tom Blyth playing the leads.",
      "So when TODAY.com caught up with Henry days before her newest book was released, we led with one question: How are you holding up?",
      "\u201cI've never had an interview open with that question!\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt is intense, this has been kind of a breakneck pace for me.\"",
      "Just the last few months alone have been an exciting time for Henry. As she was gearing up to release \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" early screeners for \"People We Meet On Vacation\" were viewed by select audiences, and the response so far, she tells TODAY.com, has been a \"relief.\"",
      "\"It is definitely a lot but I\u2019m riding the high in the adrenaline of all of it,\" she says. \"It\u2019s been a really, really beautiful whirlwind.\"",
      "Read on for TODAY.com's conversation with the bestselling author.",
      "This interview has been condensed and edited.",
      "It's really weird. On some days, it feels totally normal and mundane almost, and then it will hit me. I don't think it will ever feel totally normal. I think I was set up to understand how bizarre and uncommon and miraculous all of this is and I try to appreciate it at every turn. It definitely stays feeling a bit surreal at all times, but that's probably a good thing.",
      "I think \"Great Big Beautiful Life\" was sort of a sidestep where I got to have a romantic-comedy plotline but also do something a little bit different. I will write some more straightforward romantic comedies in the coming years, but I also really enjoyed getting to do something different and I'm excited to see what else is out there that would be fun to work on. At some point, I would love to revisit writing thrillers, but I am always going to love a love story.",
      "I'm a laptop and couch person. I love that Abby does that. I'm just a mess with my phone, so if I were writing fully on my phone, that would take five times as long as it would on a computer.",
      "But I will say, a lot of times, my favorite scenes are things that I first do have to write down on my phone because they happen when I'm out on the go. Sometimes you're in a waiting room and something occurs to you, or you're lying down at night and trying to go to sleep and then I have an idea for a scene or a bit of dialogue. I have to pull out my notes app and transcribe as well as I can with one eye shut. So there is something really freeing about being untethered from your computer.",
      "Oh my gosh, that makes me so happy. I didn't see a ton because I do not Google anything with \"Emily Henry\" in it. But I do get tagged and saw some really excited readers who got to see an early cut of the movie. It thrilled me and relieved me.",
      "When I saw the cut, I felt pretty sure that the readers were going to be totally in love with it. But it's definitely still a relief and really exciting to see what has been the case so far.",
      "It's the full spectrum of human emotion to go through this process. It truly is a miracle that anything gets made, and it's especially a miracle when something good gets made because there are so many obstacles. The big thing for me is wanting the adaptations to be something that the readers would be excited about but that also can stand alone as movies. That's what everybody wants, and I do believe that they've managed to pull that off.",
      "I don't think it has because from the beginning, I have understood that adaptations are going to be polarizing and people are going to have intense feelings and opinions.",
      "I think readers don't fully understand the scope of what an author can and cannot do with an adaptation. I have used every moment that I have been invited to the table, so to speak, to advocate for what I think the readers will care most about. Beyond that, I am well aware that there's not so much that I can do.  I think there's a misconception that writers are out there casting their own movies and making big calls and that's simply not the case. We are one of many, many, many voices in any room that we're in when it comes to adaptations. All we can do is advocate for the readers and hope it works out.",
      "I think there\u2019s still a sense that these books are only for women, and that\u2019s not true. I do think that\u2019s still a large percentage of who the readership is, but these books are just books, they\u2019re just stories. They\u2019re meant for anyone who needs them and anyone who should feel welcome to pick them up and give them a try.",
      "I think they\u2019re really, really important cornerstones of fiction. I think love stories are always going to matter, because to most of us, love really matters.",
      "I do think right now we are seeing a huge boom because the world does feel so unpredictable and chaotic and scary. \"Beach Read\u201d came out at the start of the pandemic and I really think that part of the reason that book took off in the way it did was because we were all housebound and lonely and isolated. And even though the pandemic is now over, I think that some of those feelings of isolation have hung around and I think we\u2019re all looking for connection and hope and I think romance offers those two things in spades.",
      "The purpose of a happily ever after, to me, is to present the idea of hope and to present the idea that even though the world can be chaotic and scary and unpredictable, there are these things in our lives that make all of it worth it or manageable on some level, and that is love."

      "The supernatural horror flick opens with a shot of Sammie, portrayed by newcomer Miles Caton, arriving bloodied and bruised to his father\u2019s Mississippi church service in the 1930s. Frightened as his son stumbles toward him with a broken guitar, the preacher asks Sammie to reject his love of music, for good.",

      "What happens at the end of \u2018Sinners\u2019?",
      "After introducing characters like Smoke, Stack and Sammie in the first few minutes, \u201cSinners\u201d shows them preparing to open a juke joint in an old mill the twins purchased from a deceitful and racist landowner. As the sun sets, patrons, including Mary (Steinfeld) and Pearline (Lawson), arrive for the establishment\u2019s grand opening while others, such as Cornbread (Miller), Grace (Li), Delta Slim (Lindo) and Annie (Mosaku), are already there to help Smoke and Stack pull off a successful night.",
      "The characters spend the early hours of the evening in pure revelry, dancing and singing along to Sammie\u2019s music before an uninvited guest named Remmick (O\u2019Connell) asks to be invited in. He is denied, but ominously waits outside.",
      "Each time a character leaves the juke joint, they return changed and suddenly need approval to re-enter. Sensing an otherworldly presence, Annie quickly realizes that Remmick is a vampire who bites and creates more blood-thirsty creatures whenever a guest leaves the safety of the jukebar.",
      "Remmick later turns Mary into a vampire, who in turn does the same to her former lover Stack. Soon, more guests are turned into the undead and only a handful of humans remain.",
      "Who dies in 'Sinners'?",
      "Ultimately, everyone who is bitten and turned into a vampire dies, but some of those vampires do live on, which viewers learn in a post-credits scene.",
      "Leading up to the climatic battle, Smoke, Annie, Delta Slim, Pearline, Grace and Sammie decide to think of a plan while Remmick and the other vampires await their demise. After a desperate Grace welcomes the vampires in, the others, armed with stakes and garlic water, fight for their lives.",
      "Annie is bitten and Smoke stabs her in the heart, at her request, before she becomes a vampire. Pearline is also killed and Grace is burned alive trying to defend herself against a vampire who has taken over her husband\u2019s body. Delta Slim chooses to sacrifice himself to give Smoke and Sammie time to escape.",
      "Before the credits officially roll, viewers learn that Smoke and Sammie are the only humans left standing.",
      "Lindo spoke to TODAY.com about his character\u2019s fate and why it was honorable given Delta Slim\u2019s backstory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very heroic thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sacrifice that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to, as I see it (and) as Delta Slim sees it, preserve the future of the music and the future of the culture, it has to be done.\u201d",

I couldn\u2019t save him, but I will save the young preacher boy, the young one, the young pup who\u2019s carrying the tradition forward.\u201d",
      "Who survives in 'Sinners'?",
      "As the last humans standing, Smoke and Sammie attempt to flee but vampire Stack catches them. Smoke and Stack fight and Smoke appears to get the upper hand before the scene cuts to show Sammie, who jumped out a window and injured his leg, being surrounded by Remmick and all the vampires.",
      "While Remmick tries to drown and kill Sammie, the young musician reaches for his guitar \u2014 which the twins gave to him \u2014 and smashes it into Remmick\u2019s head. The metal plate on the guitar lodges in Remmick\u2019s head and kills him as the sun rises and turns all the other vampires into ashes.",
      "Sammie returns home and the scene of him walking into the church service replays. Meanwhile, Smoke, who also survived, stays at the juke joint and waits for the man who sold him the old mill to arrive. He shoots the landowner and all the Ku Klux Klan members after previously learning from Remmick that they had planned to ambush Smoke, Stack and their friends the next morning.",
      "During the shootout, one bullet hits Smoke and he slowly dies before being greeted by an apparition of Annie and their child, who died years ago.",
      "Sammie now becomes the only human survivor. However, once the post-credits roll, viewers learn that Stack and Mary, who are both vampires, have survived as well.",
      "What do the two post-credits scenes mean?",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d waits until a post-credits scene to reveal if Sammie chose to rebuke music like his father asked.",
      "As the credits roll, viewers see an older Sammie playing music at a dive bar with his band in the \u201890s. The musician chose to continue to pursue his love of music despite that traumatic night.",
      "In a second post-credits scene, the older version of Sammie sits at a bar before two familiar faces join him: Stack and Mary. It is revealed that Mary ran off and evaded the sunlight before Remmick and the others were burned years ago.",
      "Stack sits by Sammie\u2019s side and shares that he made a deal with Smoke during their fight to leave Sammie alone. Sammie tells them that he was having the best day of his life before the bloodbath. Stack agrees, pointing out that it was the last moment he felt sunshine and saw his brother.",
      "Stack and Mary then leave, leaving the door open for a potential sequel."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China on Thursday directly contradicted President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that Beijing and Washington are actively discussing resolutions to a trade war that threatens to upend the global economy.",
      "While Trump said Wednesday that the world\u2019s two largest economies are \u201cactively\u201d talking, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson responded that \u201cChina and the U.S. have not engaged in any consultations or negotiations regarding tariffs, let alone reached an agreement.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, made the comments at a briefing in Beijing, saying that reports of ongoing talks were false. He added that while China is open to negotiations, \u201cif it\u2019s a fight, we will fight to the end.\u201d",
      "At 145%, Trump\u2019s tariffs are higher on China than any other country. As he ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods in recent weeks, citing unfair trade practices, Beijing has responded in kind, bringing its total tariff on U.S. goods to 125% \u2014 levels that amount to a mutual trade embargo.",
      "The prospect has raised fears of a global recession, sending markets whipsawing as trade tensions have done the same. Relations briefly appeared to improve Wednesday after the Trump administration signaled that it was discussing reducing tariffs with China.",
      "Still, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave conflicting accounts of the state of negotiations Wednesday, with Bessent saying \u201cboth sides are waiting to speak to the other,\u201d without providing further detail. The secretary reiterated remarks he made the previous day, predicting near-term de-escalation."

    "summary": "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in an incident last month when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian emergency workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in\u00a0an\u00a0incident last month\u00a0when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian\u00a0emergency\u00a0workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "In a video, Mahmoud Ajjour is beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood.",
      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",
      "Mahmoud now lives in Doha, Qatar, with his family, after becoming one of a very small number of Palestinians to be evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical treatment.",
      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",

      "Mahmoud Ajjour, 9, was fleeing an Israeli attack in Gaza with his family when he turned back to urge his loved ones to move forward, the World Press Photo organization said in a statement accompanying the picture taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf.",
      "Then he was hit in an explosion, the Netherlands-based nonprofit added.",
      "One of Ajjour's arms was completely severed, while the other was left severely injured and ultimately had to be amputated.",
      "\u201cOne of the most difficult things Mahmoud\u2019s mother explained to me was how when Mahmoud first came to the realization that his arms were amputated,\u201d Abu Elouf said in the statement from World Press Photo. \u201cThe first sentence he said to her was, \u2018How will I be able to hug you?\u2019\u201d",
      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",
      "Ajjour is one of hundreds of children in Gaza to have lost at least one limb during the war, which has seen more than 51,000 people killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "UNICEF warned in December 2023 that around 1,000 children in Gaza had seen one or both legs amputated alone since Oct. 7, 2023, when Israel began its military campaign in the enclave following the Hamas-led terror attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThese are unbelievable numbers,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Fara,\u00a0head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview earlier this month, noting that thousands of children have also been killed and more still have been left without one or both parents.",
      "Al-Fara said he could not understand \u201cthe silence of the world\u201d in the midst of the widespread devastation in Gaza, where much of the enclave has been destroyed.",
      "Many of the operations children in Gaza have had to undergo have been done without anesthetic, according to UNICEF, with the enclave's health care system also hit hard by Israel's offensive, which it restarted last month after a pause in the fighting.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of the ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 ended March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces\u00a0shattered the fragile truce and have since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Israel has also barred the entry of medical supplies, along with food, water and other vital aid, during a more than monthlong blockade of the enclave.",
      "Efforts to secure a more permanent ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza have so far failed to yield results.",
      "In the meantime, Ajjour is learning how to live without his arms.",
      "\"We all help Mahmoud in everything, in food, drink, clothing and the smallest things.\" But she said her son is also learning to use his feet to do things like writing and playing games on his mobile phone.",

Indian authorities said all visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be revoked with effect from Sunday, adding that all Pakistanis currently in India must leave before their visas expire based on the revised timeline.

      "Dust off the history books and there are papal conclaves with international intrigue, royal rigging and even riots, a checkered past that belies the air of sanctity and solemnity surrounding modern papal elections.",
      "The word \u201cconclave\u201d comes from the Latin for \u201cwith key.\u201d It is a church tradition that began in 1268 with a papal election that lasted almost three years, ending only when the townspeople of Viterbo locked up the cardinals, tore the roof off their palace, fed them nothing but bread and water and threatened them until a new pope was chosen.",
      "While it is very unlikely the decision on Pope Francis\u2019 successor will take quite as long or be quite as contentious, Vatican watchers agree that the winner is not a foregone conclusion.",
      "\u201cThe great joy of the conclave is that nobody really knows and it\u2019s such a unique electorate,\u201d James Somerville-Meikle, the former deputy director of the Catholic Union of Great Britain, told NBC News before Francis\u2019 death. \u201cSo many conclaves in the past have thrown up surprises.\u201d",
      "The College of Cardinals, he said, has always been faced with two questions: \u201cDo we try something new? Do we go for continuity?\u201d",
      "NBC News takes a look at the figures believed to be the top contenders.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi",
      "The fifth of six siblings, the Rome-born Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, 69, has built a reputation as a peacemaker and has worked with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic lay association devoted to ecumenism and conflict resolution.",
      "\u201cThat community had a very active role in peace-building activities and finding agreements in Africa, where they have been involved in South Sudan,\u201d said NBC Vatican analyst Deborah Lubov. The east African nation has been ravaged by civil war, violence and famine since it gained independence from neighboring Sudan in March 2011.",
      "Lubov added that Zuppi, the archbishop of Bologna, was one of four mediators who helped bring an end to the civil war in the east African country of Mozambique in 1982 and more recently had been Francis\u2019 envoy for peace in Ukraine and Russia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart man, left of center, although ideologically speaking he is very close to the center of the church,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University.\u00a0\u201cHe would be a mix between John Paul II and Pope Francis on social issues and moral issues.\u201d",
      "Tim Gabrielli, the Gudorf chair in Catholic intellectual traditions at the University of Dayton in Ohio, agreed that Zuppi was \u201cvery close to Francis,\u201d and that he is \u201cvery much a pastor figure, close to the people.\u201d",
      "But Gabrielli said Zuppi was \u201crelative newcomer\u201d when it comes to Italian episcopal politics and didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily have the breadth of Vatican experience that is often looked at.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin",
      "The second Italian on the list, Parolin, 70, has been Francis' secretary of state since the pope chose him in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a diplomat, and this is something that the cardinals might like,\u201d said Faggioli, although he added that as secretary of state \u201cyou have to make many decisions on behalf of the pope, and you have to make a number of enemies among other cardinals.\u201d",
      "Parolin, Faggioli said, is \u201ca centrist, and he\u2019s a man of the institution, a stabilizer.\u201d",
      "However, Faggioli and other Vatican insiders agreed that Parolin\u2019s chances could take a hit because he was the chief architect of an agreement with China on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in the communist country that gave the pope the final say.",
      "Critics complained that it betrayed Catholics who remained loyal to the pope despite persecution, and some have said it prevented the Vatican from denouncing rights abuses in China. They also point to increasing restrictions on religious freedoms in China for Christians and other minorities.",
      "Parolin would have a lot of explaining to do about China to remedy his reputation as a credible candidate when it comes to the future of the Catholic Church, some Vatican obeservers said.",
      "Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151",
      "The first of six children, Hungarian Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151 \u201ccirculates regularly in conservative blogs as one who would shift away from Francis,\u201d according to Monsignor Kevin Irwin, a research professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "\u201cA decided player for the conservative cardinals,\u201d Irwin said via email, adding that Erd\u0151, 72, now the archbishop of Budapest, is \u201ca highly trained canon lawyer\u201d who has written several erudite articles and books on the sources of canon law.",
      "Faggioli at Villanova agreed Erd\u0151 was a strong candidate, one who was much more conservative and \u201ca traditional Catholic when it comes to family, marriage, gay rights.\u201d",
      "Faggioli added that Erd\u0151 differed with Francis on the way the church should address immigration.",
      "While Francis often called for compassion toward migrants, he said Erd\u0151 was \u201cmore Eastern European and questions the ability to assimilate.\u201d",
      "Gabrielli said Erd\u0151 reminds \u201csome of us of John Paul II ... [which] comes from the fact that they were both raised under communist rule.\u201d",
      "He is also similar to Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who \u201cthought of Europe as key and the idea that Christianity of Europe was very important.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Tagle, who has been dubbed the \u201cAsian Pope Francis\u201d by some, would be presenting himself as a close follower of the recently deceased pontiff, according to Somerville-Meikle of the Catholic Union of Great Britain.",
      "Tagle, 67, a Filipino national who features his nickname, \u201cChito,\u201d on his X profile, is known as a champion of the poor in the Philippines and has campaigned on many social issues in his homeland, Somerville-Meikle said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly articulate and would be very able to extend Pope Francis\u2019 reflections theologically,\u201d said Gabrielli, adding that Tagle has been adept at taking Francis\u2019 ideas and running with them.",
      "However, Gabrielli said that Tagle\u2019s reputation took a bit of a hit when Francis ousted the management of the Vatican\u2019s international charitable organization, Caritas Internationalis, after an external review found management and morale problems at its head office.",
      "Tagle, who had served as the organization\u2019s president since May 2015, was among those relieved of their duties, despite having called for the review in the first place, Gabrielli said.",
      "\u201cThere might be questions resulting from that about his ability to manage,\u201d he added.",
      "However, since June, Tagle has been in charge of the Dicastery for Evangelization, one of the church's most important departments, and Gabrielli said he seemed to be doing \u201ca good job there.\u201d",
      "Other contenders",
      "Among the other candidates who might come up for consideration are the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, and Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, 77, the archbishop of Colombo in Sri Lanka.",
      "The general secretary of the Synod of Bishops, the Maltese Cardinal Mario Grech, and Cardinal Charles Muang Bo of Burma, the archbishop of Yangon, may also be considered.",
      "Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, the archbishop of Vienna, is also a \u201cwell respected\u201d figure who understands the importance of governing an international archdiocese while maintaining a \u201cmoderate line between being open-minded to dialogue about the future of the church but also keeping close to the tradition of the Catholic faith,\u201d NBC News\u2019 Lubov said.",
      "But at 80, \u201chis days as a candidate are probably behind him,\u201d Gabrielli said, although he added that Sch\u00f6nborn \u201cbefuddles people who try and label him as either conservative or liberal,\u201d which might lead some to see him as a compromise candidate.",
      "Age and experience may rule out Canadian Cardinal G\u00e9rald Lacroix, the archbishop of Quebec, because at 67, some may consider him too young, Faggioli said. \u201cI expect they will look for a candidate in their 70s,\u201d he added.",
      "Gabrielli added that Lacroix was \u201ca real pastor, people person. He\u2019s not a corporate in-his-office type, which I think reminds people of Francis. He really prioritizes evangelization, but I wonder if he has the global scope that some cardinals will look for.\u201d"

      "They are compiled in a more than 400-page tome called the \u201cOrdo exsequiarum Romani pontificis,\u201d which includes the liturgy, music and prayers used for papal funerals over the centuries.",
      "\u201cThe Ordo covers the rituals that are followed from the moment a pope dies to the moment a pope is buried,\u201d said the Rev. David Collins, an associate professor and the director of Catholic studies at Georgetown University.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "But in accordance with his wishes, Francis is expected to be buried at the ancient Basilica of St. Mary Major, which lies outside the Vatican\u2019s walls.",
      "The Vatican laid out plans for the body of Pope Francis on Monday, saying that he will be placed in his coffin later the same night.",
      "\u201cHis Most Reverend Eminence Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, will preside over the rite of confirmation of death and the placing of the body in the coffin,\u201d the Vatican said in a statement.",
      "The rite will take place in the Chapel of the Domus Sanct\u00e6 Marth\u00e6.",
      "His body could be moved to St Peter\u2019s Basilica as early as Wednesday to allow his worshippers to pay their respects, the Vatican said, adding that a formal decision on the issue would be made by a group of cardinals during a meeting on Tuesday.",
      "The playbook for Francis\u2019 funeral will also draw from a 20-page document called the \u201cUniversi Dominici Gregis,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cThe Shepherd of the Lord\u2019s Whole Flock\u201d and was issued by John Paul in 1996, Collins said.",
      "\u201cThis, essentially, lays out the procedures for what happens after a reigning pope dies between the death of one pope and the election of his successor, a period called the papal interregnum,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Those were the rules that were in place during the send-off of John Paul, who died April 2, 2005, and was buried six days later. During those six days, millions of people filed past his coffin in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and there was a funeral attended by presidents and monarchs. Because Benedict resigned and was not the pope when he died, Francis\u2019 ceremonies will more closely resemble John Paul\u2019s.",
      "This is what happens during the interregnum, which started with Francis\u2019 death and will last until the College of Cardinals chooses a new pope:"

For instance, Argentine Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio chose the name Francis upon being elected in 2013 \u2014 the first pope to use the name Francis. \u00a0By comparison, there have been more than 20 popes\u00a0with the most common name: John.",
      "At the time of his death, Francis was the second-oldest pope in the last 400-some years.",
      "Since 1600, more than 30 popes have served. Nine of those, including Francis, were 70 years of age or older when elected. And more than half worked into their 80s \u2014\u00a0something that\u2019s happening more and more as the average age of popes climbs."

      "Australian identical twin sisters Bridgette and Paula Powers have captured the internet\u2019s attention after a video of them recounting a frightening experience with a carjacker went viral.",
      "On April 21, 7News Queensland, a local news station in Australia, uploaded\u00a0a clip to X\u00a0about twin sisters who observed a car thief on Steve Irwin Way. When journalist Marlina Whop introduced the segment, she said the network interviewed two sisters who explained how their mother and another man interacted with the thief. But the Powers sisters\u2019 retelling was far from what viewers were anticipating.",
      "In the interview, Bridgette and Paula Powers spoke in unison while dressed in the same bunny-covered shirts. \u201cOne guy, he was up there with our mom. He went up there and he was coming back down toward us. And he goes, \u2018Run, he\u2019s got a gun!\u2019\u201d the sisters reenacted at the same time. \u201cOh, our hearts started to pound. I said, \u2018Mom, where\u2019s mom?\u2019\u201d",
      "They then heard their mom approach the carjacker, who had blood on his face, and ask if he was OK. The two said the man threatened to shoot their mother.",
      "\u201cMom distracted him to make him look the other way,\u201d they continued, still talking as one. \u201cMom ran into the bush behind the fence and the guy goes to her, \u2018I\u2019ll find you and I\u2019ll shoot you.\u2019\u201d",
      "They said they were \u201cblessed\u201d that he didn\u2019t harm their mother.",
      "Bridgette and Paula Powers only differed at the end of their joint statement when one said they \u201cran for their life\u201d and the other said they \u201cran for their safety.\u201d",
      "X users quickly reacted to the clip, which racked up over 1 million views in less than 24 hours.",
      "\u201cNothing can prepare you for the witness interview 7 News decided to run with on this story,\u201d one\u00a0tweeted.",
      "Another\u00a0said, \u201cThis is the kind of scene you couldn\u2019t script, characters you couldn\u2019t invent.\u00a0Watch it immediately with the sound on. Australia can\u2019t be real.\u201d",
      "A third\u00a0labeled\u00a0it an, \u201cInstant classic.\u201d",
      "Although the interview is currently going viral, Bridgette and Paula Powers, also known as the Twinnies, have been local celebrities for years as wildlife rescuers.",
      "In 2021, the sisters were interviewed by the\u00a0Australian broadcasting network ABC News\u00a0about their conservation efforts and their history working with the late Steve Irwin.",
      "According to the news outlet, the sisters had to leave school in year 10 due to health issues. They then started focusing on their passion for taking care of animals and have been doing so ever since.",
      "\u201cWe love all creatures great and small,\u201d they told the Australian network.",
      "One day, they met Irwin when they were helping a sick green sea turtle. He arrived to also save the sea turtle and was \u201cquite taken with them,\u201d according to their sister Liz Eather.",
      "Following their meeting, Bridgette and Paula Powers began working at the Australia Zoo and launched a charity called\u00a0Twinnies Pelican and Seabird Rescue, which they have operated for over 20 years, the Australian news outlet said.",
      "Bridgette and Paula Powers also explained in the article why it is \u201cnatural\u201d for them to speak in unison.",
      "\u201cOur brains must think alike at the same time,\u201d they said. The two acknowledged that it is \u201cweird\u201d to some and revealed they tried to alter the way they speak in the past.",
      "\u201cWe do annoy a lot of people,\u201d they continued, before adding that changing \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel right to us at all.\u201d",
      "They spoke about dressing the same, too. The sisters shared they weren\u2019t fans of wearing different outfits. \u201cWe did try once but we still got stared at. So what the heck. We might as well wear the same clothes again,\u201d they said.",
      "They described the \u201cspecial\u201d bond between them as being \u201clike a magnet.\u201d"
