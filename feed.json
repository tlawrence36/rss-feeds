      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin,\u2019\u201d has died",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I'm Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d",
      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",
      "Moore is survive by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

      "With homes smoldered, streets emptied and friends scattered by evacuation orders, Guttenberg counted himself among the fortunate. His property was miraculously spared. But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",
      "\u201cJust this morning, I woke up and I was really conscious of my mental state and my mental health, because the last three days, I've seen so much tragedy,\u201d said Guttenberg, pacing through the ruins of his neighborhood. He said his home has electricity but no running water.",
      "Guttenberg thanked God that his block was safe, but he said about 20 homes were burned \u201cpretty bad\u201d in his 80-home community after wind-whipped fires tore across Los Angeles, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. He said the fires are the worst he's ever seen in his 66-years.",
      "The wildfires have burned the homes of several celebrities including Billy Crystal, Carey Elwes and Paris Hilton.",
      "Guttenberg said he never expected all of this to happen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when someone dies suddenly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when someone gets hit by a car. You never expect that to happen. That\u2019s how shocking it was.\u201d",
      "During Guttenberg\u2019s stroll, it was an eerie scene with scorched palm trees, homes reduced to ash and rubble, and the daytime skies casted an ominous twilight over the devastation.",
      "\u201cI've seen people scared, people in wheelchairs, mothers and fathers trying to find their kids, people having anxiety and panic attacks,\u201d said Guttenberg, who returned to his neighborhood to help others who stayed behind with relief efforts. He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. .. Maybe people can donate at one point to some sort of fund. But I just think, be a good neighbor right now.\u201d",
      "When asked about the timeline for his neighborhood's recovery, Guttenberg thinks it could take anywhere from five to 10 years to rebuild and fully heal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be unbelievable to try to rebuild this. Rebuild all the beautiful trees, homes and retail shops and lifestyle. The psychology of it all, it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d"

      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",
      "Born in Vienna, Schenk studied acting at Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts, began directing in 1953 and led his first opera, Mozart's \u201cDie Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute),\" at Salzburg's State Theatre in 1957. He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",

      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17.",
      "Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications.",
      "The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said.",
      "\u201cI hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,\u201d he said.",
      "The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.",
      "The study did not look at surgeries among transgender adolescents. Other researchers have found those procedures are extremely rare among young people.",
      "Not all transgender youth proceed with medical treatments, said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, co-lead author of the adolescent standards of care for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a leading transgender health group.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s new government has begun an ambitious project to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "The Uyghurs are a Turkic, majority Muslim ethnicity native to China\u2019s far west Xinjiang region. After decades of conflict with Beijing over discrimination and suppression of their cultural identity, the Chinese government launched a brutal crackdown on the Uyghurs that someWesterngovernments deem a genocide. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, possibly a million or more, were swept into camps and prisons, with former detainees reporting abuse, disease, and in some cases, death.",
      "Over 300 Uyghurs fleeing China were detained in 2014 by Thai authorities near the Malaysian border. In 2015, Thailand deported 109 detainees to China against their will, prompting international outcry.

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- The inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro left his opponents to grapple with with conflicting feelings of hope and disappointment on Saturday, pondering why the self-described socialist leader could not be stopped despite credible evidence that he had lost the election last year.",
      "Some described their mood after Friday's ceremony at the legislative palace in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, like an emotional hangover while others said they feel abandoned.",
      "Many expressed cautious optimism, finding a measure of comfort in the social media videos released by two opposition leaders \u2014 popular former lawmaker Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, the opposition's candidate in the vote \u2014 who had promised to topple Maduro.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it feels as if the soup got cold,\u201d college professor Nelson Perez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the subject of not losing hope for a while. ... But then you realize it\u2019s more of the same.\u201d",
      "That realization is hard to process for millions of Venezuelans who, like Perez, had imagined a different Jan. 10 \u2014 one with Gonz\u00e1lez receiving the presidential sash and Machado giving one of her signature fiery speeches before the National Assembly.",
      "Instead, Gonz\u00e1lez and Machado sent messages on social media while Maduro placed his hand on Venezuela\u2019s constitution and took the oath of office, defying overwhelming evidence contradicting his victory claim in the July presidential election.",
      "Maduro compared himself to a biblical David fighting Goliath and accused his opponents and their supporters in the United States of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war.\u201d He said his enemies\u2019 failure to block his inauguration to a third six-year term was \u201ca great victory\u201d for Venezuela\u2019s peace and national sovereignty.",
      "\u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America,\u201d he said after being draped with a sash in the red, yellow and blue of Venezuela\u2019s flag. \u201cI come from the people, I am of the people, and my power emanates from history and from the people.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, stacked with government loyalists, had declared Maduro the winner of the July 28 election. But unlike in previous contests, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts to back the announced result.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online \u2014 showing its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had won by a more than a two-to-one margin. U.N. experts and the U.S.-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "Machado, in a message on social media Friday, said Maduro was guilty of a coup by not leaving office by Jan. 10, when by law, Venezuela\u2019s presidential term begins. She also said she was confident that the country\u2019s \u201cfreedom is near\u201d but stopped short of saying anything about future steps the opposition could take to end Maduro\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cToday, Maduro didn\u2019t put the sash on his chest. He put a shackle on his ankle, which will tighten every day,\u201d she said.",
      "A day earlier, Machado \u2014 who was banned from running for office but remains the driving force behind Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered opposition \u2014 had emerged from months of hiding to join an anti-Maduro protest in Caracas. She said security forces had briefly detained her after leaving the rally, an allegation the government promptly denied.",
      "Thursday\u2019s rally drew far smaller crowds than the massive demonstrations Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez had led during the election campaign, primarily because of fears over the government's brutal crackdown on dissent. More than 2,000 people were arrested during and after the civil unrest that followed the election.",
      "\u201cYou see people, and they look like they have a hangover,\u201d bricklayer Luis Carlos Moreno, 55, said of the mood among those who had stayed away from the inauguration ceremony. \u201cWe have to wait until next week to see how things go and if \u2026 everyone goes to work and the kids go to school.\u201d",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China and Britain restarted economic and financial talks on Saturday after a six-year hiatus during a visit by Britain's Treasury chief to Beijing, as the U.K.\u2019s Labour government seeks to reset strained ties with the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Rachel Reeves traveled to Beijing accompanied by a delegation of British business leaders and finance officials. She met with Chinese leaders including Vice Premier He Lifeng and Vice President Han Zheng.",
      "The two sides revived the China-U.K. Economic and Financial Dialogue \u2014 annual bilateral talks that have been suspended since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and deteriorating relations. London hopes renewed dialogues will help bring down barriers that U.K. businesses face when looking to export or expand to China.",
      "\u201cToday marks a significant milestone in the U.K.-China relationship with the first Economic and Financial Dialogue between our countries for nearly six years,\u201d Reeves said. She said the meeting signaled the new U.K. government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to fostering a stable, long-term partnership\u201d with China and desire to boost economic cooperation.",
      "Britain wants to improve exchanges in areas such as sustainable finance, capital markets connectivity, pensions and regulatory alignment, as well as trade and investment, Reeves added.",
      "\u201cAs part of this, it is important to prevent economic links weakening our national security and economic resilience,\u201d she said.",
      "Vice Premier He said China and Britain should improve cooperation in trade and investment, clean energy, financial services, the green economy, biomedicine, artificial intelligence and other fields.",
      "\u201cWe are willing to work with the U.K. to create a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment and provide good conditions for the other side\u2019s companies to invest and operate in each other\u2019s countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The Sino-British ties have soured following a series of spying allegations from both sides, China\u2019s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony.",
      "British officials said Reeves will also urge Beijing to stop its material and economic support for the Russian war effort in Ukraine and raise the issue of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.",
      "The delegation included Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and the CEOs of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the London Stock Exchange Group. Senior executives from some of Britain\u2019s biggest financial services firms, including the group chairs of HSBC and Standard Chartered, were also included.",

      "It\u2019s all part of a bid by Starmer, elected as leader in July, to strengthen political and economic ties with China, the U.K.\u2019s fourth-largest single trading partner, according to the Treasury.",
      "Officials said Starmer wanted a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach to working with Beijing on global stability, climate change and the transition to clean energy. But some in the opposition Conservative Party have criticized his stance and said trade ties should not come at the expense of national security and human rights concerns.",
      "British political leaders and intelligence chiefs have repeatedly warned that China poses security threats. Calls to tackle the challenge grew louder last month when it emerged that an alleged Chinese spy had cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew and carried out \u201ccovert and deceptive activity\u201d for China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, according to officials.",
      "\u201cNational security is the foundation of what any government acting in the national interest will prioritize,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cBut we need to make sure that we have pragmatic and good relations with countries around the world. That is in our national interest.\u201d",

      "Greek lawmakers are debating legislation to regulate short-term rentals",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Lawmakers in Greece began debating proposed legislation on Friday to toughen rules for short-term rentals amid a surge in tourism, including a ban on using converted storage spaces and windowless basements.",
      "Renovated warehouses, underground spaces and former industrial properties will be removed from rental platforms under the proposed changes, including locations already converted for hospitality use.",
      "\u201cBasements will no longer be allowed for use: Rental spaces must serve as primary residential use areas, with natural light, ventilation and air conditioning,\u201d Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni told state-run television ahead of the debate.",
      "\u201cWe are introducing minimum operational and safety standards, because this is a tourism product,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is the long-term, sustainable and high-quality development of Greek tourism, not just breaking records every year.\u201d",
      "The draft legislation coincides with a one-year ban in Athens on new short-term rental registrations in popular districts like Kolonaki, Koukaki and Exarchia, with violations punishable by a fine of 20,000 euros ($20,500).",
      "Vacation rentals have helped expand Greece\u2019s vital tourism industry \u2014 directly accounting for 13% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023 \u2014 but also added pressure on household expenses because of higher rents during the broader cost of living crisis.",
      "The government says it wants to balance tourism benefits with housing accessibility and is offering tax incentives for property owners to shift away from short-term leasing.",
      "Greece is expecting tourism revenue to reach a record 22 billion euros ($22.7 billion) in 2024 with a projected 35 million tourist arrivals, according to official estimates.",
      "The number of rooms available using short-term rentals was roughly equivalent to those in hotels nationwide in 2023, but nearly double in central Athens, according to a study commissioned by a national hoteliers association. The body is seeking tougher regulation of properties booked using online platforms like Airbnb.",
      "On the opening day of debate, several opposition lawmakers accused the center-right government of disregarding the social costs and the strain on resources caused by the expanding tourism and called for more comprehensive rental restrictions.",
      "\u201cYou are allowing the concentration of short-term rentals in areas popular with tourists. That is drastically transforming neighborhoods and displacing permanent residents,\u201d left-wing lawmaker Kalliopi Vetta told parliament.",
      "\u201cThe expansion of tourism is going unchecked,\u201d she said. \u201cThis focus on profit alone is happening at the expense of the environment and society.\u201d",
      "The draft legislation, which also introduces more detailed safety and operational standards for vacation rentals, is due to be voted later this month."

He was finally sent back to France that evening, the French interior ministry said.",

      "The two countries have a turbulent relationship: Algeria, once a French colony, shook off rule from Paris in 1962 after a brutal war.",
      "Two other Algerian influencers were arrested last week in the Alpine city of Grenoble and the western port city of Brest, while a female TikTok influencer was taken into police custody in the city of Lyon on Thursday. She is accused of making \u201cdeath threats\u201d against opponents of the government in Algiers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no question of giving free rein to the hatred of these individuals who are spreading antisemitism, murder etc.,\u201d Retailleau said. \u201cSocial networks are not a lawless zone.\u201d",
      "Retailleau also sharply criticized the detention since November of French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal in Algeria, who is an outspoken critic of the Algerian government. Retailleau said Sansal is \u201cold and ill\u201d and accused Algiers of keeping him in prison \u201cfor the wrong reasons.\"",
      "A shift last July in France\u2019s decades-old position on the disputed Western Sahara region of northern Africa angered Algeria and prompted the withdrawal of its ambassador in Paris."

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn in Friday for a new term, extending his increasingly repressive rule in the face of renewed protests and rebukes from the United States and others who believe he stole last year's vote.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by security forces who have become Maduro's main hold on power since last summer's disputed election. Crowds of people, many sporting pro-Maduro T-shirts, gathered in adjacent streets and a nearby plaza.",
      "Maduro, likening himself to a biblical David fighting Goliath, accused his opponents and their supporters in the U.S. of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war.\u201d He said his enemies' failure to block his inauguration to a third six-year term was \u201ca great victory\" for Venezuela's peace and national sovereignty.",
      "\u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America,\u201d he said, after being draped with a sash in the red, yellow and blue of Venezuela\u2019s flag. \u201cI come from the people, I am of the people, and my power emanates from history and from the people. And to the people, I owe my whole life, body and soul.\u201d",
      "The backslapping among government insiders in downtown Caracas on Friday contrasted sharply with the hundreds of Venezuelans who took to the streets Thursday to protest Maduro\u2019s power grab.",

Machado, whom the government has barred from running for office, emerged from months of hiding to join the rally against Maduro.",
      "On Friday, she posted a video online in which she described the confusing incident. She said national guardsmen fired shots on her convoy then dragged her off a motorcycle from behind and said they were taking her to prison. She said her motorcycle driver was shot in the leg.",

      "Maduro\u2019s supporters accused the opposition faction of spreading fake news to generate an international crisis. It pointed to the 20-second video it released Thursday \u2014 in which Machado says she simply dropped her purse as she was being chased \u2014 as evidence that she was not detained.",
      "\u201cToday Maduro didn\u2019t put the sash on his chest. He put a shackle on his ankle, which will tighten every day,\u201d Machado said Friday.",

      "The Biden administration, citing Venezuela's \"severe humanitarian emergency,\" also extended for 18 months a special permission allowing 600,000 Venezuelan migrants to stay in the U.S. It also upped to $25 million a reward for the arrest of Maduro and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S., and placed a new bounty of $15 million on Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino.",
      "Maduro's 2018 reelection was widely rejected as a sham after authorities banned key opponents from running. And Venezuela's opposition faction accuse him of outright ballot fraud last year.",
      "Their proof: tally sheets collected from 85% of electronic voting machines that show Gonz\u00e1lez won by a landslide. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, whom Maduro invited to observe the election, said the voting records posted online by the opposition look legitimate.",
      "Nevertheless, electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28 but, unlike in previous presidential contests, they did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court \u2014 which like every other institution in Venezuela is packed with loyalists \u2014 to audit the results. As expected, the court reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory.",
      "The dispute over the results sparked nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary. More than 20 people were killed during the unrest. Dozens of foreigners \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans \u2014 were also rounded up.",

      "Estonian naval ships are taking part in stepped-up patrols in the Baltic Sea by NATO countries after undersea power and communications cables have been damaged in recent months",
      "ABOARD THE EML SAKALA IN THE BALTIC SEA -- As they plied the gray, icy waters of the Baltic Sea west of Russia on Thursday, the crew of the Estonian minehunter EML Sakala kept a careful eye on any vessels slowing down suspiciously or suddenly changing course.",
      "They use binoculars and cameras with long zoom lenses, logging the names of ships, scouring them for missing anchors or trailing cables. The Sakala has approached about 200 vessels in a week at sea.",
      "It is one of three Estonian navy ships that are part of stepped-up maritime patrols by NATO countries after the Estlink-2 power cable and communication links between Finland and Estonia were damaged Dec. 25. A month earlier, two other undersea data cables were damaged.",
      "Suspicion immediately fell on Russia, although nothing has been proven and the Kremlin denied involvement in damaging the infrastructure, which provides power and communication for thousands of Europeans.",
      "For the West, the incidents are a test of resolve in the face of what are believed to be widespread sabotage attacks in Europe allegedly linked to Moscow following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is to show force,\u201d Lt. Cmdr. Meelis Kants of the Estonian navy told The Associated Press aboard the Sakala.",
      "After the Dec. 25 incident with the Estlink 2, Finnish police and border guards seized the Eagle S, an oil tanker that had just left a Russian port, after it was suspected of cutting the power and four telecommunications cables by dragging its anchor.",
      "The Eagle S, flagged in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, is suspected of being part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid sanctions on Russian oil exports, Finnish authorities said. The ship was carrying 35,000 tons of oil and investigators allege it left a drag trail with its anchor for almost 100 kilometers (62 miles) on the sea bed before it was stopped and escorted to the vicinity of a Finnish port.",
      "The damage to the Estlink 2, which can provide about half of the electricity needs for Estonia in winter, did not disrupt service, although it did drive up energy prices in the Baltic nations.",
      "The cable is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) long and is located at a depth of 90 meters (295 feet) at its deepest point, across one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe. Repairs could cost tens of millions of dollars and might not be restored until late summer, said Finland\u2019s electricity grid operator.",
      "The undersea cables and pipelines that crisscross the sea link Nordic, Baltic and central European countries, promote trade, energy security and, in some cases, reduce dependence on Russian energy resources.",
      "Ten Baltic Sea cables have been damaged since 2023, affecting Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. At least two incidents involved ships later accused of dragging their anchors.",
      "\u201cThe sea domain is currently the most contested because it\u2019s also strategically important,\u201d Maj. Gen. Andrus Merilo, commander of the Estonian military, told AP in December.",
      "Western nations need to be \u201cmore proactive and operate to deter any activities,\" he said.",
      "The Estlink 2 disruption came just over a month after a Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, left the Russian port of Ust-Luga, west of St. Petersburg, shortly before it allegedly damaged cables linking Sweden and Lithuania and Finland and Germany.",
      "The ship was stopped by the Danish navy and spent a month idled in a Danish shipping lane before resuming its journey Dec. 21 after representatives from Western nations boarded it along with Chinese investigators. No details of the inspection were released.",
      "In October 2023, a Chinese-registered ship was suspected of severing a gas pipeline and fiber-optic cable between Finland and Estonia by dragging its anchor. That ship was not stopped and continued its journey.",
      "Of particular interest to the naval patrols is Russia\u2019s shadow fleet of vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to ship its oil and evade Western sanctions.",
      "The Eagle S had multiple violations including fire safety, navigation equipment and pump room ventilation and cannot sail until repaired, according to Finnish authorities. The shipping news journal Lloyd\u2019s List reported it previously was fitted with surveillance devices to monitor naval activity \u2014 abnormal for a merchant ship.",

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really know \u2014 at least not from the beginning \u2014 who is behind it. Is it an accident? Is it not? Is it hostile activity or not?\u201d he said, adding that the goal is to scare people and create a \u201dpolitical mess.\"",
      "While European authorities have acted more decisively in recent months to halt ships suspected of sabotage, officials have stopped short of categorically pointing the finger at Moscow without ironclad proof.",
      "Following the Estlink 2 incident, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told the German newspaper Die Welt that the \u201csabotage attempts in the Baltic Sea are not isolated incidents\u201d but \u201cpart of a pattern of deliberate and coordinated actions to damage our digital and energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish President Alexander Stubb and German Foreign Minister Annalenna Baerbock also suggested the similar incidents in the Baltic cannot be a coincidence.",

      "To get ahead of potential threats from hostile states, European nations must address them \u201con the same footing as we do with our collective security in NATO. This is a matter for all of us,\u201d Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told AP.",
      "In December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, made up of 10 European nations from the Nordic and Baltic countries plus the U.K., Iceland and the Netherlands, agreed to cooperate more closely to counter Russia\u2019s use of shadow ships.",
      "They said they had tasked maritime authorities with requesting proof of insurance from suspected ships sailing through northern Europe, although that did not stop the Eagle S.",

      "A popular New Zealand bird \u201creality show\u201d that each year follows a pair of northern royal albatrosses as they breed and raise a chick has drawn a global audience of devoted fans in its current 10th season",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- It\u2019s a reality show about a loving couple waiting to welcome their new arrival, watched by thousands of ardent fans. But the stars of Royal Cam, now in its 10th season, aren\u2019t socialites or hopefuls in love but northern royal albatrosses \u2014 majestic New Zealand seabirds with 10-foot (3-meter) wingspans.",
      "The 24-hour livestream of the birds\u2019 breeding season at Taiaroa Head \u2014 a rugged headland on New Zealand\u2019s South Island \u2014 was established to raise awareness of the vulnerable species, numbers of which have grown slowly over decades of painstaking conservation measures.",
      "Millions have watched the stream since it began in 2016.",
      "\u201cBefore that, it was very difficult to follow an albatross\u2019 life cycle because they\u2019re only on land 15% of the time,\u201d said Sharyn Broni, a Department of Conservation ranger who has worked with the birds for nearly three decades. \u201cYou\u2019d have to travel a long way to see one.\u201d",
      "But Royal Cam's popularity exploded during the coronavirus pandemic. On a busy comments page hosted by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation, devoted fans track the birds\u2019 locations on an app, discuss significant moments and even create art inspired by the albatross.",
      "The show's premise is simple: Each season, conservation rangers select an albatross couple as that year\u2019s stars. A camera on the remote headland follows the chosen birds as they lay and incubate an egg, before their chick hatches around February, grows to adult size, and finally takes flight.",
      "Unlike human reality shows, drama is rare: Royal albatrosses usually mate for life. Rangers selecting the birds to follow each \u201cseason\u201d avoid anything controversial: no first-time parents and no aggressive or grumpy personalities.",
      "This year\u2019s stars are RLK, a 12-year-old male, and GLG, a 14-year-old female, who have raised two chicks before. Their names are derived from the colors on bands that rangers attach to their legs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a youngish pair, but not so young that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Broni said.",
      "Action unfolds slowly, which for many fans is the joy of it. Clouds drift by, ships pass in the distance and the sun sets in glowing pinks and peaches. During January, incubation season, an albatross sits on an egg.",
      "But regular watchers anticipate certain moments: About once every 10 days, the second bird in the pair returns from feeding at sea to relieve the parent looking after the nest. Other fan highlights include albatross crash landings, mating dances and the appearances of rangers or the feathered stars of previous seasons.",
      "France Pilli\u00e8re, an artist who lives in Montreal, has never visited New Zealand. But during the pandemic she discovered Royal Cam, fell in love with the \u201cmysterious\u201d creatures, and became a daily viewer.",
      "\u201cYou see the birds and all their adventures and their lives, struggling to raise their chicks,\u201d she said.",
      "Pilli\u00e8re stayed, too, for the global community of posters. Unlike much of the internet, the nearly 75,000 comments on the Royal Cam viewing page are uniformly encouraging and educational.",
      "\u201cWe care about these people,\u201d Pilli\u00e8re said of her fellow posters. \u201cIf one is on a flight to New Zealand, everyone is waiting to hear their comments.\u201d",
      "The past two breeding seasons were the birds\u2019 most successful ever, with 33 chicks each year. There are more than 60 breeding pairs at the colony \u2014 conservation measures began in 1937 with one pair.",
      "Progress is unhurried because the northern royal albatross lives long and slowly; after their first flight, chicks stay at sea for 4 to 10 years \u2014 traveling up to 118,000 miles a year \u2014 then spend about three years choosing a mate. They live until around 40.",
      "The New Zealand mainland colony \u2014 one of four sites \u2014 is home to 1% of the 17,000 birds worldwide. While breeding measures have proved a success, Broni said, the birds are more threatened than before by plastic pollution, fisheries and warming seas.",
      "Pilli\u00e8re said the death of a chick from ingesting plastic in 2023 had prompted her to drastically reduce her household\u2019s plastic use. The royal albatross has also crept into her work as a sculptor of animals.",
      "The livestream of Taiaroa Head is \"a real soothing place,\u201d Pilli\u00e8re said. \u201cThe only thing you see is positive. The chatters will often say it\u2019s their best place to be.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s acting leader on Friday accepted the resignation of the chief of the presidential security service, Park Jong-joon, as he faced police questioning over how his forces blocked law enforcement efforts to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol last week.",
      "The acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, also expressed regret over the clashes between law enforcement officials and the presidential security service over the attempts to detain Yoon and called for lawmakers to reach a bipartisan agreement to launch an independent investigation.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police are planning a second attempt to bring Yoon into custody as they jointly investigate whether his brief martial law declaration on Dec. 3 amounted to an attempted rebellion. The presidential security service blocked an earlier attempt to detain Yoon at his official residence, which he has not left for weeks.",
      "Park ignored two summonses before appearing for questioning on Friday over allegations of obstructing justice, a week after his forces repelled dozens of anti-corruption and police investigators from Yoon\u2019s official residence. Park said his duty is to protect the president and warned of \u201cbloodshed,\u201d as critics said that his agency is becoming Yoon\u2019s private army.",
      "The anti-corruption office and police have vowed to make a second, more forceful effort to detain Yoon, warning that members of the presidential security staff could be arrested if they get in the way. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Park\u2019s resignation and Choi\u2019s call for an independent investigation to take over the probe on Yoon would affect their push to bring Yoon into custody.",
      "The embattled president remains holed up at his official residence in Seoul, where the presidential security service has fortified the grounds with barbed wire and rows of vehicles blocking the roads.",
      "Yoon made a short-lived declaration of martial law and deployed troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, which lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.",
      "His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 and accused him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him.",
      "There\u2019s also speculation that police may attempt to detain Park and other leaders of the presidential security service before trying again to execute the detainment warrant against Yoon, which was renewed by a Seoul court on Tuesday.",
      "Speaking to reporters upon arriving for police questioning, Park again criticized the efforts to detain Yoon, saying that the investigation should proceed in a manner \u201cappropriate for the status of an incumbent president\u201d and the \u201cdignity of the nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany citizens are surely deeply concerned about the possible conflict and confrontation between government agencies,\u201d Park said. \u201cI came here today with the belief that under no circumstances should there be any physical clashes or bloodshed, and am hoping to prevent such incidents from occurring.\u201d",
      "Park said he made several calls to Choi, urging him to mediate an alternative approach with law enforcement and also made similar requests to Yoon\u2019s lawyers, but did not receive a satisfactory response.",
      "While the presidential security act mandates protection for Yoon, it does not authorize the service to block court-ordered detainments and some legal experts say the presidential security service\u2019s action last week may have been illegal.",
      "Asked in parliament about the presidential security service\u2019s effort to block the detention, National Court Administration head Cheon Dae-yeop said Friday that \u201cresistance without a legitimate reason can constitute a crime, such as obstruction of official duties.\u201d",
      "Although the president himself has wide-ranging immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have questioned the legitimacy of a new detention warrant against Yoon issued by the Seoul Western District Court, arguing that the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges or order police to detain suspects.",
      "They also argue that detention and search warrants against Yoon cannot be enforced at his residence, citing a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have urged the agency to either indict the president or seek a formal arrest warrant, a process that requires a court hearing. However, they have said that Yoon would only comply with an arrest warrant issued by the Seoul Central District Court, which handles most key requests in high-profile cases.",
      "They accuse the agency of deliberately choosing another court with an allegedly favorable judge, even though the official residence is located in the jurisdiction of the Western District Court.",

      "PANAMA CITY -- A Panamanian national holiday remembering the killing of 21 protesters by police and U.S. troops in 1964 is taking on new resonance this year as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatens to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "On Jan. 9, 1964, students protested in the then-U.S. controlled canal zone over not being allowed to fly Panama\u2019s flag at a secondary school there. The protests expanded to general opposition to the U.S. presence in Panama and U.S. troops got involved.",
      "Historians say what has come to be known as Martyrs\u2019 Day was a key point of inflection that led to the signing of an agreement more than a decade later by U.S. President Jimmy Carter to turn over control of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.",

      "Tajani presided Thursday over a meeting in Rome of foreign ministry officials from five countries \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States \u2014 and spoke earlier by telephone with his counterparts from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The aim, he said, is to coordinate the various post-Assad initiatives, with Italy prepared to make proposals on private investments in health care for the Syrian population.",
      "Going into the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their European counterparts, Tajani said it was critical that all Syrians be recognized with equal rights. It was a reference to concerns about the rights of Christians and other minorities under Syria\u2019s new de facto authorities of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamic militant group that the U.S. and U.N. have long designated as a terrorist organization.",

      "\u201cHonestly, I am dying,\u201d said the former leader, who governed the small South American nation of Uruguay from 2010 to 2015. The article noted that he had tears in his eyes.",

      "Later, as Uruguay's 40th president, he transformed his nation into one of the healthiest and most socially liberal democracies in Latin America, legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana. As a leftist icon, he sparked global fascination by shunning the presidential palace to live in a tiny farmhouse and donating most of his salary to charity.",
      "The 89-year-old first revealed last April that doctors had found a cancerous tumor in his esophagus. He underwent radiotherapy, and, last September, Mujica\u2019s doctors said the esophageal cancer appeared to have gone into remission.",

      "Mujica's personal doctor, Raquel Pannone, held a news conference Thursday to elaborate on the ex-president's medical condition. She said treatment options for the cancer were limited from the start, given Mujica's various illnesses.",
      "\u201cHe should continue like this and be as calm as possible,\u201d Pannone said, declining to provide further details about Mujica\u2019s prognosis. She said the leftist leader had not experienced changes to his daily life or pain levels.",

      "Protesters called for an end to Turkish airstrikes, which they said are damaging vital infrastructure and endangering civilian lives.",
      "Turkish drones and warplanes remained in the air during the protest, and airstrikes targeted areas near the march route, according to participants and a war monitor. The health administration in Kobani said the strikes killed five civilians and injured 15 others.",

Heavy fighting has been reported in areas near the Tishrin Dam, some 90 kilometers (60 miles) east of the city of Aleppo.",
      "\u201cWhile we were walking in this march, there were about 13 or 14 airstrikes around us,\u201d said Berfin Dumar from Kobani, who joined Wednesday\u2019s protest. \u201cThey tried to silence our voices so we wouldn\u2019t be able to protect this dam.\u201d",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk is preparing to host a live-streamed chat on his social media platform X on Thursday with a leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party, amplifying concerns across Europe about potential meddling by the world's richest man in the upcoming national election there.",
      "Musk worked last year to help re-elect Donald Trump in the United States. Now Musk, in control of an influential social media platform that often spreads disinformation, is using it to endorse the far right in Germany ahead of its Feb. 23 election.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk wrote on X on Dec. 20, using the acronym for the party, known in German as Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.

      "Still, the AfD has been put under observation by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism, and mainstream parties have shunned working with it.",
      "The AfD has strongly rejected the designation and portrayed it as a political attempt to discredit the party.",
      "AfD was formed in 2013 and has moved steadily to the right. Its platform initially centered on opposition to bailouts for struggling eurozone members, but its vehement opposition to then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to allow in large numbers of refugees and other migrants in 2015 established the party as a significant political force.",
      "AfD has seen its support grow as a result of discontent with center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition government. It hopes to emerge as the biggest party in three state elections in the formerly communist east, where it has its strongest support, in September."

      "ISLAMABAD -- ISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline\u2019s image.",
      "The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.",
      "Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.",
      "Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an \u201cirresponsible statement\u201d by a former aviation minister.",
      "The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot\u2019s exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.",
      "The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.",
      "Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said. The Chinese-funded airport was inaugurated by Chinese Premier Li Qiang in October.",
      "The airport, Pakistan's largest, is located in restive southwestern Balochistan province and is part of a massive investment by Beijing that links a deep seaport and airport on the Arabian Sea by road with China."

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An oil tanker that burned for weeks in the Red Sea after being attacked by Yemen's Houthi rebels and threatening a massive oil spill has been salvaged, a security firm said Friday.",
      "The Sounion had been a disaster-in-waiting in the waterway, with 1 million barrels of crude oil aboard that had been struck and later sabotaged with explosives by the Iranian-backed Houthis as part of their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It took months for salvagers to tow the vessel away, extinguish the fires and offload the remaining crude oil.",
      "\u201cOver three challenging weeks, the fires were extinguished, cargo tanks patched and pressurised with inert gas, and the vessel declared safe,\u201d said the private security firm Ambrey, which helped lead the response alongside a European naval force and salvagers. \u201cIn early October, she was towed north to Suez for removal of her cargo, which has now been successfully completed.\u201d",
      "The U.S. State Department had warned that a spill from the Sounion would have been \u201cfour times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster\u201d in 1989 off Alaska.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Houthis, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, for over a decade and have been battling a Saudi-led coalition backing the country's exiled government for nearly as long.",
      "The Houthis initially attacked the Greek-flagged Sounion tanker on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.",
      "The Houthis later released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign.",
      "The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. However, they have continued to launch drones and missiles targeting Israel.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A senior official of the European Investment Bank says the regional lending agency is keen to double its funding for Bangladesh, but she expressed concern over human rights as the country endures a spell of political turmoil.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, the bank\u2019s Vice President Nicola Beer said the lending arm of the European Union will support reforms initiated by the interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus that has been running the country since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in mass protests in early August.",
      "The 27-nation European Union is the largest destination for Bangladesh\u2019s garment exports, a vital lifeline for millions of the country\u2019s workers that earns the country more than $36 billion a year. The industry employs about 4 million workers, mostly women from rural areas.",
      "Beer said the Luxemburg-based lending agency wants to double its fund portfolio for Bangladesh to 2 billion euros ($2.06 billion) while supporting the South Asian country's democratic transition, rule of law and freedoms of expression.",
      "\u201cYes, of course, we are focusing on human rights, rule of law and freedom of expression,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our discussions we always are very firm on these points that the freedom of expression, freedom of opinion ... are very important, and that this and all the following governments have really to make sure that these human and citizens rights are guaranteed.\u201d",
      "Hasina has been in exile in neighboring India since Aug. 5, when she fled the country. Yunus has promised to hold an election in December of this year or in the first half of 2026, depending on progress in reforms in various sectors.",
      "Yunus is facing criticism over problems with law and order, rising commodity prices, treatment of minority groups and economic woes after many factories were shuttered due to labor protests or poor security. Economic growth fell to only 1.8% percent in the July-September quarter as student-led unrest disrupted business activities, according to a report released earlier this month by the Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Beer said she appreciated reform measures taken by the Yunus-led government.",
      "\u201cThis is important from what I hear, especially from entrepreneurs, is that they are applauding this course of reforms, which is now on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we as a bank (will) try to support because this is important for the economy here in Bangladesh, for investors \u2026 coming from outside or inside the country.\u201d",
      "In October, the World Bank slashed its forecast for the fiscal year that will end in June to 4%, citing \u201csignificant uncertainties following recent political turmoil.\u201d",
      "The European Investment Bank is involved in some major infrastructure development projects, mainly focused on green energy, safe water, communication and climate change.",
      "Beer visited bank-funded projects and met with officials, including Yunus, during her three-day visit to Bangladesh.",
      "She emphasized the importance of working on integrating the region in such areas as electricity grids that could link to hydropower projects in mountainous Nepal, for example.",
      "\u201cI think we should discuss in the region to get more out of this interconnectivity, because this is a win-win situation, a win situation for Bangladesh, a win situation for the smaller neighbors like Bhutan and also Nepal or Myanmar. And it could be also a win situation for India,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard without electricity,\u201d said the former deputy school director who has stockpiled firewood to ensure he can use his wood burning stove in the room he shares with his wife to stay warm. \u201cThere\u2019s still gas \u2026 but it will end soon.\u201d",
      "The village of Copanca is situated just several kilometers across the de facto border from Moldova\u2019s separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left without heating and hot water after Russia halted gas supplies to the region on Jan. 1, over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies to Moldova.",
      "The decision by Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom, which came into effect a day after a gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, halted gas supplies to Transnistria\u2019s gas-operated Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which provided a significant portion of Moldova\u2019s electricity.",
      "Copanca, like over a dozen other towns or villages administered by Moldovan authorities in the capital Chisinau but situated close to Transnistria, remains interconnected to the separatist region\u2019s Soviet-era energy infrastructure leaving them vulnerable amid the energy crisis.",
      "Planned daily electrical outages throughout Transnistria \u2014 which includes Copanca \u2014 are currently scheduled for four hours twice a day. While the Kuciurgan power plant transitioned to coal and has led to some unexpected outages, some residual gas remained in the pipes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get by with the electricity and gas shortages,\u201d said Donici. \u201cYesterday, we were without power for eight hours. Everyone is scratching their heads, figuring out what to do, so they don\u2019t freeze.\u201d",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, and has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy to destabilize the European Union candidate country. Russia has denied it is meddling in Moldova.",
      "Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean this week accused Russia of artificially creating an energy crisis to cause \u201cinstability in the region\u201d and \u201cto influence the results of the parliamentary elections\u201d that Moldova will hold later in 2025.",
      "\u201cWhat they want to achieve is to have a pro-Russian government in Moldova that would ultimately allow for the consolidation of the military capacity of Russia in the Transnistrian region, and correspondingly to use this leverage over Ukraine,\u201d Recean told journalists in a closed call with other senior officials on Monday.",
      "Transnistria \u2014 which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries \u2014 declared a state of emergency last month as the gas crisis loomed. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s roughly 350,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. Russia also bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a sprawling \u201chybrid war\u201d against it by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country\u2019s EU aspirations.",
      "Last month, Moldova\u2019s parliament also voted to impose a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, and fears that the situation could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where temperatures often drop to subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "The looming crisis also prompted Chisinau to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "Moldova's state energy company, Energocom, has increased electricity purchases from neighboring Romania to ensure capacity but are also more costly. Although a mild January is helping matters, energy prices have increased and the government has said it will provide help to offset bills.",
      "EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on the social media platform X this week that Russia \u201ccontinues to use gas as a weapon and once again Moldova is a target of its hybrid warfare,\" adding that \u201cThanks to EU support Moldova remains resilient and well-connected to European energy networks.\"",
      "Moldova\u2019s government this week announced plans to connect more than a dozen towns and villages under Chisinau\u2019s control that are interconnected with energy infrastructure in Transnistria to energy networks in Moldova.",

      "\u201cWhere possible, people bought generators, but that\u2019s also not a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with a generator, someone needs to start it, a person who understands how to use it. It requires money, staff.\u201d",
      "Cutzari added that institutions in his village including a kindergarten, medical facilities, an ambulance, city hall and a post office would struggle if the gas ran out entirely. \u201cIt would be better if electricity and gas were always available,\u201d he said.",
      "Prime Minister Recean said that since the beginning of the energy crisis, his government in Chisinau has \u201cproposed organizing procurement for purchasing gas on behalf of the Transnistrian side,\" but that authorities in the region\u2019s de facto capital, Tiraspol, have refused.",
      "\u201cTiraspol is not autonomous in the decisions it makes,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis crisis is induced by the Russian Federation in order to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and to use the Republic of Moldova in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "After visiting Copanca and other villages in a similar bind on Thursday, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said some kindergartens and schools have been provided with power generators, and that mayors can request help from Chisinau to supply firewood, wood-burning pellets, and generators.",
      "\u201cWe communicated with them that we are doing our best to provide them alternatives that provide light, water and heat for their families,\u201d she said, adding that Moldova is discussing \u201cpotential assistance\u201d with external partners.",
      "Carina Cazac, the owner of a convenience store in Copanca, said locals rushed to purchase essentials like oil and flour when the crisis hit, and that generators and oil lamps quickly sold out.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were stressed, and they started buying gas lamps,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's easier in the villages because most people have wood-burning stoves \u2026 others bought generators.\u201d",

      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "In \u201cWorld Economic Situation and Prospects 2025,\u201d U.N. economists wrote that their positive prediction was driven by the strong although slowing growth forecast for China and the United States and by the robust performances anticipated for India and Indonesia. The European Union, Japan, and United Kingdom are expected to experience modest recovery, the report says.",

      "The report says the U.S. economy outperformed expectations last year thanks to consumer and public-sector spending, but growth is expected to slow from 2.8% to 1.9% this year.",
      "The report points out that China sees its own strong growth slowing slightly from 4.9% in 2024 to 4.8% in 2025 due to lower consumption and property-sector weaknesses that are failing to make up for public investment and export strength. This is forcing the government to enact policies to lift property markets, fight local government debt and boost demand.",
      "China's \u201cshrinking population and rising trade and technology tensions, if unaddressed, could undermine medium-term growth prospects,\u201d the report reads.",
      "The U.N. projected last January that 2024 global economic growth would be 2.4%. It said Thursday that the rate was estimated to have been higher, at 2.8%.",
      "Both remain below the 3% rate that the world saw before the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020.",
      "European growth this year is projected to gradually pick up after a weaker than expected performance in 2024. Japan is poised to pick up from periods of near-recession and recession. India is expected to drive a strong outlook for South Asia, with regional growth projected at 5.7% in 2025 and 6% in 2026.",
      "India's 6.6% growth forecast for 2025 is backed by solid private consumption and investment growth, the report says.",
      "\u201cThe global reduction of poverty over the past 30 years has been driven by strong economic performance. This has been especially true in Asia, where rapid economic growth and structural transformation have allowed countries such as China, India, and Indonesia to achieve poverty alleviation unprecedented in scale and scope,\u201d the report says.",

      "Trump said this week he will use economic coercion to pressure Canada to become the nation\u2019s 51st state. And he continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Trump is trying to distract from his threats of stiff tariffs by talking about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that conversation,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cEverything American consumers buy from Canada is suddenly going to get a lot more expensive if he moves forward on these tariffs. And that\u2019s something we need to be focusing on a little bit more.\u201d",
      "Trudeau made comments in an interview with CNN in Washington, where he attended the funeral for the late U.S. President Jimmy Carter.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "\u201cWe would definitely respond as we did years ago,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Yogurt imports from Wisconsin and whiskey from Kentucky, the home states of top Republicans Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell respectively, were hit with 10% duties in 2018.",
      "Florida, Trump's home state, is known for its extensive citrus production.",
      "Trump claimed again Thursday that the U.S doesn\u2019t need anything from Canada, including oil.",
      "Almost a quarter of the oil the U.S. consumes every day is from Canada, with Alberta exporting 4.3 million barrels a day to the U.S. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels a day, while domestically producing about 13.2 million barrels a day.",
      "\u201cWe don't need their energy. We don't need their oil and gas,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don't need anything that they have.\u201d",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada's most populous province, said Trump has been misinformed about the U.S. not needing Canadian products.",
      "Supply chains for the auto industry are deeply connected, with parts manufactured in Ontario being used in cars that are assembled in Detroit and then sold back to Canada. Ford has noted that in the auto sector alone parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times.",
      "Ford warned that Canada will retaliate if Trump imposes tariffs. He said a wide range of U.S. products shipped to Canada will be targeted, but he declined to specify which ones.",
      "Top Canadian government officials say Trump\u2019s comments that Canada should become the 51st state are no longer a joke and are meant to undermine America\u2019s closest ally.",
      "\u201cThe joke is over,\u201d Dominic LeBlanc, the country\u2019s finance minister and point person for U.S.-Canada relations, said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for him, I think, to sow confusion, to agitate people, to create chaos knowing this will never happen.\u201d",
      "LeBlanc has been talking to incoming Trump Cabinet officials about a billion-dollar plan to increase border security in an effort to deflect Trump's threat of tariffs. Trudeau called that a win for Trump.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",

      "Two hundred Utah ski patrollers returned to work Thursday after voting to accept a new labor contract and end a nearly two-week strike that closed many trails and caused long lift lines at the ones that remained open during a busy time of year at the country's biggest ski resort.",
      "The Park City Ski Professional Ski Patrol Association claimed victory, saying in a statement that Colorado-based Vail Resorts, which owns Park City Mountain Resort, acceded to its key demands including a $2-an-hour base-pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",
      "\"This contract is more than just a win for our team \u2014 it\u2019s a groundbreaking success in the ski and mountain worker industry. This effort demonstrates what can be achieved when workers stand together and fight for what they deserve,\u201d ski patroller and union lead negotiator Seth Dromgoole said in a statement.",
      "Union negotiators and Vail Resorts announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative deal. The full union voted Wednesday to accept the agreement.",
      "The strike began Dec. 27 after negotiations that started in March bogged down and the union accused Vail Resorts of bargaining unfairly. The strike coincided with the busy holiday season and a period of more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of fresh but difficult-to-access snowfall at the resort.",
      "Despite the closed trails and long lift lines, some skiers expressed support for the strikers, chanting \u201cPay your employees!\u201d in videos posted on social media.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to welcoming back the Park City Mountain patrollers in the coming days and moving forward together as one team. We apologize to our guests who were impacted by this strike and are incredibly grateful to our team who worked hard to keep the mountain open and operating safely over the past two weeks,\" Bill Rock, Vail Resorts' mountain division president, said in a statement.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. It said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and living costs are well above average.",
      "The raises include a $4-an-hour average increase for senior ski patrollers, with some specialized long-time workers getting an average of $7.75 more, according to the union.",
      "The union also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It had been offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren\u2019t rare, but this strike happened after talks went much longer than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "\u201cThe issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling injured skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody is nearby. Many work other jobs in the summer, including as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip."

      "LAS VEGAS -- When Russell Maichel started growing almonds, walnuts and pistachios in the 1980s, he didn't own a cellphone. Now, a fully autonomous tractor drives through his expansive orchard, spraying pesticides and fertilizer to protect the trees that have for decades filled him with an immense sense of pride.",
      "\u201cThe sustainability of doing things perfectly the first time makes a lot of sense,\u201d the first-generation farmer told The Associated Press at CES 2025, where John Deere unveiled a fleet of fully autonomous heavy equipment, including the tractor Maichel has been testing on his northern California farm.",
      "Sustainability is a key theme this year at the annual tech trade show in Las Vegas. From Volvo CEO Martin Lundstedt announcing their commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040 to Wisconsin-based OshKosh Corporation showing off its electric fire engines and garbage trucks, companies big and small are showcasing their green innovations and initiatives.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need more climate-smart technologies,\u201d said Jacqueline Heard, CEO and co-founder of Enko Chem, which researches climate tech solutions in agriculture \u2014 an industry Heard says is \u201cunder a lot of pressure right now.\u201d",
      "That much is clear on the CES show floor, where farming is on full display and company leaders are highlighting the impacts of climate change and labor shortages on farmers.",
      "Not far from John Deere's booth where autonomous tractors and dump trucks are towering over conference attendees, Kubota, another equipment manufacturing company, is showcasing its AI technology that detects diseases in crops and sprays where pests have been identified.",

      "Stucke himself grew up on a potato farm in Ohio. Each night after dinner, his father would scour the field for bugs and then send Stucke out to spray the crops with insecticides.",
      "\u201cWe sprayed the whole field, but we might've only needed to spray a part of the field or a plant,\u201d he said. \u201cTake that analogy into vineyards, orchards and so forth, you don\u2019t have to spray everything.\u201d",
      "This is known as \u201cprecision agriculture,\u201d Heard said. \u201cIt allows farmers to really optimize their land.\"",
      "The idea, Heard said, is that farmers can expand the lifespan and improve the quality of their crops while using fewer chemicals, like pesticides and fertilizer.",
      "\u201cIt's good for the environment. It's good for farmers,\" she said.",
      "Heard said she wouldn't be surprised if AI can one day help farmers map out their land, showing them the different soil types and what kinds of crops would grow best there.",
      "\u201cIt could be that with climate change, they should move to a crop that's much more adapted to this new world,\" she said.",
      "Back at the John Deere booth, Maichel, a tree nut farmer, said he's hopeful that advancements in AI will help him better manage the unpredictability of farming. Each year on his orchard is different from the last.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sliding scale, per se, that we have to deal with as far as climate change goes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really bend to the climate that we\u2019re dealt with. It\u2019s not something I can predict. It\u2019s really something we have to adapt to every growing season.\u201d",
      "If someone had told him just 10 years ago that a tractor would one day be driving itself through his orchard, he said he wouldn't have believed it. But now, he says, he sees how this evolving technology can help him adapt to the changing industry and climate.",

      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",

      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "\u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan memorably wrote four decades ago.",
      "That seems like a simpler time \u2014 especially when you consider Meta's decision to end a fact-checking program on social media apps Facebook, Instagram and Threads and what the ramifications might be for an industry built to bring clarity and to seek truth itself.",
      "Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's announcement this week was widely seen in news verification circles as a genuflection to president-elect Donald Trump, whose first term in office popularized the phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d",
      "Meta is replacing its fact-checking with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system reminiscent of X, where it depends on users to correct misinformation on its platforms. In a way, that hearkens back to \u201che said-she said\u201d journalism, or the view of some political debate moderators that it should be the role of opponents, not journalists, to point out falsehoods. It also hints at something else: the notion that the loudest voices and the best-told stories can win the day.",
      "The moment is a crossroads for the fact-checking industry, which will see its influence sharply curtailed when Trump takes office for his second term.",
      "\u201cIn the short term, this is bad news for people who want to go on social media to find trustworthy and accurate information,\u201d said Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network. Her organization started in 2015 with about 50 members and now has 170, some of whom face staff cuts and potential closure because of Meta's move.",
      "\u201cIn the long term,\" she said, \"I think it\u2019s very uncertain what this will all mean.\u201d",
      "Fact-checking is an odd industry, particularly when you consider that it's a function of all journalism. The concept bubbled up about three decades ago in part to counter \u201che said-she said\u201d stories and monitor claims in political ads. The organization FactCheck.org, whose primary aim was to help reporters, started in 2003 and the more public-facing PolitiFact four years later.",
      "PolitiFact, started by then-Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair in 2007, won a Pulitzer Prize for its 2008 campaign coverage. It called out politicians for bending or breaking the truth in ways often difficult for reporters who were protective of the sources whose voices populated their stories.",
      "By 2012, fact-checkers were under attack, primarily by Republicans convinced many were biased and researched voting records to try and prove the point, said Adair, now a Duke University professor. Trump, he said, \u201csped up a trend that had already begun.\u201d",
      "Some conservative suspicion of fact-checkers has been warranted because of mistakes that have been made, although there were some Republicans who uttered falsehoods and just didn\u2019t like being called out for it, said Steve Hayes, CEO and editor of the center-right site The Dispatch.",
      "\u201cThe people who practice fact-checking are in some ways saying, \u2019We are the arbiter of truth, period,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cAnd anytime you do this, it invites scrutiny on the work that you do.\u201d",
      "Labeling systems largely didn't help, either. Giving a misstatement the label of \u201cpants on fire,\u201d as some fact-checkers have, may be a catchy way of attracting attention but also fostered resentment.",
      "Holan resists the view that fact-checkers have been biased in their work: \u201cThat attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.\"",
      "GOP suspicion still quickly took root. Journalism's Poynter Institute, in a survey taken in 2019, found that 70% of Republicans thought the work of fact-checkers was one-sided. Roughly the same percentage of Democrats thought they were fair. Poynter hasn't asked the same question since. Yet last year, Poynter found that 52% of Americans say they generally find it difficult to determine whether what they're reading about elections is true or not.",
      "In a column Wednesday on the conservative watchdog site NewsBusters.org, Tim Graham wrote that during the first nine months of 2024, PolitiFact criticized Republican officials for delivering \u201cmostly false\u201d facts 88 times compared to 31 times for Democrats. To Graham, this proves that the idea the site is independent or nonpartisan is laughable.",
      "But is that bias? Or is it checking facts?",
      "Adair used to be reluctant to say what is now the title of his new book: \u201cBeyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do it More, and How it Could Burn Down Our Democracy.\u201d He's not hesitant anymore.",
      "\u201cTrump is unmatched as a liar in American politics,\u201d Adair said. \u201cI'm not the first to say that. I think he has capitalized on the fact that there has been this pushback on fact-checkers, and showed other politicians that you can get away with lying, so go ahead and do that.\u201d",
      "Tension about fact-checking played out during the recent presidential campaign, when Trump's team was furious with ABC News for calling attention to false statements by the former president during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump's second victory has changed the equation at Meta. Already, X has curtailed its independent fact-checking under owner Elon Musk, a Trump ally. The moves are significant because it removes fact-checking from venues where many users might not otherwise be exposed to it.",
      "On its own, fact-checking \u201cdoesn't reach those exposed to misinformation,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who started FactCheck.org. \u201cIt tends to reach audiences that were already knowledgeable and wary.\u201d",
      "On social media, fact-checking also became part of the algorithms that drove information to people, or away from them. Material labeled as false would often be downgraded so it received less exposure. To Republicans who have criticized Big Tech, that amounted to censorship. Yet to Jamieson, successful fact-checking is not censorship \u2014 \u201cit's the process of arguing.\"",
      "Jamieson expressed some optimism that other smart social media users will step up to prevent the dangerous spread of falsehoods. But for fact-checking as it is today to continue to thrive and, even, exist as a journalistic endeavor, Adair said it will likely take influential Republican figures to publicly stand up for the importance of truth.",
      "NewsBuster columnist Graham, in an interview, had a more pointed piece of advice. \u201cMy remedy in all arguments about media trust,\" he said, \u201cis that humility is required.\u201d",

      "The visit, his first for bilateral talks outside of international meetings, shows Japan\u2019s commitment to further those ties even as the U.S. presence in the region may decrease after President-elect Donald Trump takes office later this month.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia are maritime regional powers near vital shipping lanes and are key to Japanese and global security and the economy, and they share concerns over China's increasing assertiveness, officials say.",
      "Ishiba, who will meet Friday with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hopes to strengthen security cooperation and discuss efforts to ensure stable supply chains with Malaysia, which is chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year.",
      "On Saturday, Ishiba and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will reportedly sign a deal for Japan's provision of high-speed patrol boats. Talks between the two leaders, who are both former defense ministers, are expected to focus on military cooperation and arms transfers.",

      "For Jan. 9",
      "LONDON -- The new year is always a good time to make a fresh start \u2014 including with your email inbox. To kick off 2025 with a clean slate, why not clear out all those unnecessary and unwanted messages?",
      "If you're anything like me, you'll have piles of messages that have been accumulating in your inbox: receipts, bank and credit card statements, mobile phone bills, plane tickets, restaurant bookings, reminders, security warnings, spam and more.",
      "Mixed in with all that administrative detritus might be some personal missives from friends and family that are worth keeping.",
      "There are several reasons to purge all that digital clutter. For one, it cuts the risk in case of a data breach. If hackers somehow gain access to your email, they won't have any personal or financial info like credit card details to pilfer.",
      "A decluttered inbox also helps boost productivity and focus because it's easier to find important messages if you don't have to sift through reams of irrelevant ones.",
      "Some productivity proponents advocate inbox zero, a practice that requires dealing with each email that comes in so that by the end of the day your inbox is empty.",
      "But who has the time and energy for that? If you're busy, it's easier to just deal with the messages that need immediate attention and ignore the rest. That is, until the backlog becomes too big.",
      "Here are some tricks to tame your inbox by culling unwanted emails from important ones:",
      "Email accounts used to have limited storage space, say a gigabyte or two at most, which meant that messages with big attachments took up lots of space. Nowadays, email comes with plenty of free storage but it's still good practice to clear out oversized messages because they tend to build up over time. Do you really need to keep all those high-resolution photos of a forgotten friend's grandchildren?",
      "In Microsoft Outlook, click on the \u201cSize\u201d column or button to float the biggest messages to the top, where you can go through and delete them. Outlook also lets users sort by attachment so that messages with added files show at the top. If you want to save the message itself, right click on the attachment to remove it.",
      "In Gmail, go to the search settings to filter out messages that are \u201cgreater than\u201d a certain size. Start at, say, 20 megabytes, and then gradually reduce the number.",
      "Emails from frequent automated senders, such as newsletters and mailing lists, can take up a lot of space in your inbox. Or perhaps you get a lot of security notifications from your bank that might be important in the moment but quickly become outdated.",
      "It's often too tedious to delete them individually so filter your inbox by sender to delete them as a group. In Outlook click the \u201cFrom\u201d column or button. In Gmail or Yahoo mail, use the search bar to look for the sender's email address.",
      "Combine this with another search trick that narrows down the date range to filter out all those old emails that you never got around to deleting. In Outlook or Gmail, you can set a date range to capture emails from, for example, 2010 to 2017, so that you can get rid of, say, all those utility bills you don't need anymore.",
      "Emails from mailing lists tend to include certain words or language that makes it a bit easier to filter them out. One such obvious term is \u201cunsubscribe.\" Searching for a word like that, which wouldn't normally be used in emails written by humans, will identify all the newsletters for easy deletion.",
      "Copying everyone onto an email chain could be viewed as polite and courteous \u2014 or annoying, depending on whether the message topic is relevant to you. Sure, it's a good idea to CC everyone in the office about an important policy that applies to all staff but maybe not about a meeting about Bring Your Child to Work Day if you don't have kids.",
      "In Outlook there's a hack to filter out all those emails where you're not the main recipient. Go to the Home tab, click \u201cRules,\u201d and then \u201cCreate\u201d a rule. Go to Advanced Options, and tick \u201cwhere my name is in the cc box.\" For the next step, you can tick the box to move it to a folder, or even permanently delete it if you're feeling confident.",
      "Gmail users can do something similar with the search function. Type cc: and your email address.",
      "Perhaps you've tried out all these various hacks and whittled down your backlog but still have many more that you haven't gone through. Then it could be time to consider the nuclear option: delete everything.",
      "The benefit of this approach is that it really does provide you with a blank slate. You'll have no more mental anxiety if you don't have any more messages to worry about. The drawback, of course, is that you might lose any messages that might be important or precious.",

      "Electric vehicle demand is expected to keep rising this year, but uncertainty over policy changes and tariffs is clouding the forecast",
      "NEW YORK -- Electric vehicle demand is expected to keep rising this year, but uncertainty over policy changes and tariffs is clouding the forecast.",
      "S&P Global Mobility expects global sales of 15.1 million battery electric vehicles in 2025, which would mark a 30% jump. Battery electric vehicles are expected to make up 16.7% of the market share for light vehicles.",
      "Tesla, BYD of China, and other manufacturers face big unknowns in 2025. Donald Trump's presidency could mean big policy shifts in tax and other incentives for both electric vehicle makers and consumers. The threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs globally, could further complicate production and sales for electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cThere's just a lot of uncertainty in the air,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of auto intelligence at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cIt's not an environment where you want to necessarily go gangbusters.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., consumers can currently claim a federal tax benefit of up to $7,500 for certain new electric vehicles. Carmakers also benefitted from some federal support for electric vehicle production and infrastructure. It's possible for all of that to get cut under President Trump.",
      "Trump condemned the federal tax credit for electric vehicles while campaigning for the presidency. He called it part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d that would would hurt the auto industry. Still, the incoming administration is expected push for broader deregulation of industries, which could potentially help carmakers.",
      "Some of the larger electric vehicle makers had a mixed 2024 even with benefits for consumers and manufacturers. Tesla sales slipped 1.1%, its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years. Rivian's deliveries rose 2.9%.",
      "Tariffs are another threat to the industry. Production takes place globally, with parts getting imported and exported throughout the process. Trump has threatened to tax imports from Mexico, Canada, China and elsewhere, which would likely result in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "China is the largest market for electric vehicles, followed by the U.S. Within the U.S., Tesla is the dominant electric vehicle maker, with about 50% of the market share.",
      "Automakers are in a wait-and-see position along with many other industries to see whether Trump carries out the threat of rescinding tax credits and implementing tariffs.",
      "The broader auto industry is proceeding with caution. Overall, S&P Global Mobility expects that light vehicle production will have slid 1.6% in 2024 and will fall another 0.4% in 2025.",
      "That's a result of automakers better matching production and demand. Overall light vehicle sales are still expected to rise 1.7% in 2025.",
      "The ongoing transition to electric vehicles also plays a role in more tempered production. Companies like Ford and General Motors are shifting production capacity to electric vehicles in some cases instead of adding more capacity."

      "What is going on with aviation security?",
      "People have been found dead hiding in the wheel wells of planes twice in the past month. Two stowaways were arrested on different flights in November and December. Then a passenger opened an emergency door while a plane was taxiing in Boston Tuesday night.",
      "These incidents are being investigated, so we don't know yet exactly where security failed. But clearly there were gaps in security. So it's natural to wonder: is my flight safe?",
      "Passengers panicked when a man onboard a JetBlue plane taxiing for takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, trigging an emergency slide to inflate Tuesday. Other passengers quickly restrained the man, and the plane never took off, but clearly it was a scary moment.",
      "On Monday, two dead bodies were found inside the landing gear compartment of a different JetBlue plane after it landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.",
      "In late December, a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane after it landed in Maui from Chicago.",
      "Also in December, a passenger without a ticket was discovered aboard a Delta Air Lines flight as that plane was rolling across the tarmac in Seattle before it took off for Honolulu.",
      "A separate stowaway was arrested in November after a Delta Air Lines flight from New York landed in Paris. That Russian national had somehow bypassed security to board the flight.",
      "If a stowaway can get inside a plane's wheel well or sneak aboard the cabin, what would prevent someone with malicious intent from getting access?",
      "\u201cThe challenge we run into is we have a system with gaps, and those gaps are sometimes exploited,\u201d said Jeff Price, professor of aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration, the airlines and the airports are all trying to find where those gaps are and plug them. But Price said that by design there are gaps in the system.",
      "The fact that people are getting access to these planes makes pilots worried about the system.",
      "\u201cRight now we\u2019re seeing some fissure cracks. They\u2019re unacceptable. And we\u2019ve been lucky that it hasn\u2019t been somebody with broader nefarious intent,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, a longtime airline pilot and spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association union.",
      "Experts have also said that a shortage of air traffic controllers, outdated plane-tracking technology and other problems are eroding the margin of safety in air travel.",
      "The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "The last deadly crash involving a U.S. airliner occurred in February 2009, an unprecedented streak of safety. But planes have crashed elsewhere around the world. And there are other concerns.",
      "Safety regulators are worried about a number of close calls at airports in the past couple years.",
      "This is not the first time that a passenger has opened an emergency door on a plane on the ground. In one incident in Australia last year, a man opened a door and walked out onto the wing of a stationary plane and was arrested after he climbed down to the ground.",
      "Emergency doors are supposed to be able to be opened when a plane is on the ground so passengers can quickly escape if there is a problem.",
      "Passengers can take comfort in the fact that emergency doors are extremely difficult to open during a flight. There are locks that keep a door in place in flight that are armed after takeoff. And once a plane is above 10,000 feet, the air pressure inside the plane holds the door in place. Most of them are designed so that they must be pulled inward before they can be opened.",
      "But in January 2024, a panel plugging the space reserved for an unused emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner 16,000 feet above Oregon. Pilots landed the Boeing 737 Max safely, but videos from passengers showed the terrifying scene. The rapid loss of cabin pressure caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling, and suction as air rushed from the hole exerted force on people inside the plane.",
      "Investigators have said it appears that four bolts used to help secure the panel were missing after the plane was worked on at a Boeing factory in Renton, Washington.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said no bids were submitted for this week's oil and gas lease sale in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a sale the state has challenged as too restrictive and at odds with a 2017 law aimed at opening the refuge's sweeping coastal plan to exploration and development.",
      "Monday was the deadline for companies to submit bids, the agency said.",
      "Interior Acting Deputy Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said the lack of interest by oil companies in pursuing leases in the refuge's coastal plain \u201creflects what we and they have known all along \u2013 there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil and gas drilling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe oil and gas industry is sitting on millions of acres of undeveloped leases elsewhere; we\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a prudent place to start, rather than engage further in speculative leasing in one of the most spectacular places in the world,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "But this is unlikely to be the last word. The state this week sued the Interior Department and federal officials over the sale, alleging among other things that the terms were too restrictive. The state also is seeking to have the environmental review underpinning the sale thrown out. Litigation around the first lease sale \u2014 held in the waning days of the Trump administration in early 2021 \u2014 also is still pending.",
      "A 2017 law that President-elect Donald Trump has often highlighted called for offering two lease sales in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain by late 2024. Major oil companies sat out the first sale, which saw a state corporation as the main bidder. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts as president was to order a review of the leasing program, which ultimately led to the cancelation of seven remaining leases. Smaller companies had previously given up two other leases they'd held from that sale.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, has said that it offered for lease as part of the smaller, second sale 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares), the minimum acreage required by the 2017 law. The agency said its proposal avoided important polar bear denning and caribou calving areas and had the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance.",
      "Leaders in Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and oppose drilling there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and see responsible oil development as critical to the economic wellbeing of communities in the region.",
      "Drilling advocates \u2014 including state political leaders \u2014 are hopeful Trump will pursue drilling in the refuge, seeing a potential to create jobs, generate additional revenue and spur U.S. oil production. But while the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil there. And environmentalists contend the lack of interest by oil companies so far should speak volumes.",
      "\u201cThey seem to understand that drilling in this remote landscape is\u202ftoo risky, too complicated and just plain wrong,\u201d Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement. \"The incoming Trump administration still hasn\u2019t gotten the memo and has vowed to keep trying to sell the refuge for oil. We\u2019ll continue to use the power of the law to defend this cherished place, as we have for decades.\u201d"

      "Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes.",
      "Minutes from the meeting, released after the typical three-week lag, also showed clear division among the Fed's 19 policymakers. Some officials expressed support for keeping the central bank's key rate unchanged, the minutes said. And a majority of the officials said the decision to cut rates was a close call.",
      "Ultimately, the Fed choose to cut its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.3%. One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged.",
      "Still, there was widespread agreement in the minutes that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, Fed officials felt it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate.",
      "Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses \u2014 including for homes, cars, and credit cards \u2014 will remain elevated this year.",
      "Policymakers said that the Fed \u201cwas at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing,\u201d the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting, Fed officials said they expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four.",
      "Fed officials sent stock markets plummeting Dec. 18 after they reduced their outlook for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting that the decision to reduce rates had been a \u201cclose call.\"",
      "Powell also said that recent signs of stubborn inflation have caused many Fed officials to pare back their expectations for rate cuts. Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred measure, ticked up to 2.4% in November, compared with a year ago, above the Fed's target. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, it was 2.8%.",
      "In addition, some officials have started to consider the potential impact of President-elect Trump's proposals, such as widespread tariffs, on the economy and inflation next year, the minutes said.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs, for example, have estimated that Trump's tariff proposals could push inflation by nearly a half-percentage point later this year.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he still supported rate reductions this year, in part because he expects inflation to steadily head down to the Fed's 2% target. He also said he didn't expect tariffs would worsen inflation and wouldn't change his preference for lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Waller also said, in a question and answer session, that he didn't think Trump would ultimately impose the universal tariffs he promised in the campaign."

      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort reached a tentative deal with the corporate owner of Utah's Park City Mountain Resort to end a strike and resume normal operations after almost two weeks of closed terrain and long lift lines at the busiest time of year.",
      "Neither the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association nor Colorado-based Vail Resorts released details about the agreement ahead of a planned ratification vote Wednesday.",
      "Whatever happens, the strike brought attention \u2014 and judging from the many supportive car honks for strikers, sympathy \u2014 to the struggle of ski patrollers to make ends meet in pricey mountain communities.",
      "A union win could produce better pay for other ski workers, predicted one industry watcher.",
      "\u201cGenerally when one group of employees successfully bargains for a contract they think is fair, it does tend to create the \u2018rising tide lifts all boats\u2019 dynamic,\u201d said Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and the cost of living is well above average.",
      "The 200 ski patrollers at Park City Mountain Resort went on strike on Dec. 27 alleging unfair bargaining in negotiations since March. The tentative deal to be in effect through April 2027 had the unanimous approval of ski patrol negotiators, according to a joint statement from the union and the resort.",
      "\u201cEveryone looks forward to restoring normal resort operations and moving forward together as one team,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling hurt skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody\u2019s nearby. It\u2019s specialized work where familiarity with a resort\u2019s terrain and how to respond to a variety of injuries and situations can be valuable.",
      "It's also a seasonal job. Many ski patrollers work as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides in warmer months.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. The union said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "It also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It was offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren't unusual, but this strike happened after talks went much longer into the year than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Kaufman.",
      "\"The issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\" Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Despite long waits, even some Park City Mountain Resort skiers have been sympathetic to the workers. \u201cPay your employees!\u201d they chanted from lift lines in videos posted on social media.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "The 45,000 dockworkers\u2019 ongoing threats to resume their strike over automation would shut down ports and could damage the economy as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House."

      "BOULDER, Colo. -- Bill McCartney, who coached Colorado to its only football national championship in 1990, has died. He was 84.",
      "McCartney died Friday night \u201cafter a courageous journey with dementia,\u201d according to a family statement. His family announced in 2016 that he had been diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's.",
      "\u201cCoach Mac touched countless lives with his unwavering faith, boundless compassion, and enduring legacy as a leader, mentor and advocate for family, community and faith,\u201d the family said in its statement. \u201cAs a trailblazer and visionary, his impact was felt both on and off the field, and his spirit will forever remain in the hearts of those he inspired.\u201d",
      "McCartney remains the winningest coach in Colorado history, with a record of 93-55-5. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013.",
      "McCartney led Colorado to its best season in 1990, when the team finished 11-1-1 and beat Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl to clinch the national title. That season included a win at Missouri where the Buffaloes scored the winning touchdown on a \u201cfifth down\u201d as time expired -- one of the biggest blunders in college football history.",
      "The chain crew didn\u2019t flip the marker from second to third down and the officials failed to notice. On fourth down -- fifth in actuality -- Charles Johnson scored to keep Colorado\u2019s national title hopes afloat. Asked later if he would consider forfeiting the game, McCartney pointed to poor field conditions and didn\u2019t think it was a fair test.",
      "McCartney coached at Colorado from 1982 to 1994, retiring early to spend more time with his wife, Lyndi, who died in 2013. Following his retirement, he worked full time at Promise Keepers, a ministry he started in 1990 after converting from Catholicism and whose aim is to encourage \u201cgodly men.\u201d",
      "The organization became a flash point in state politics, advocating unsuccessfully that gays be denied the designation of \u201cprotected class,\u201d a position by the group that drew campus protests. He left as Promise Keepers\u2019 president in 2003 because of his wife\u2019s health but returned five years later.",
      "As a football coach, McCartney\u2019s impact at Colorado was immense. During a six-year span in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, his teams were right up there with the powers of the time. McCartney coached Colorado to three Big Eight titles, 10 consecutive winning seasons in league competition and a 58-29-4 mark in conference play, all still school bests.",
      "His 1989 team went 11-1 and lost to Notre Dame 21-6 in the Orange Bowl. That set the groundwork for a national title team that featured quarterbacks Darian Hagan and Charles Johnson, tailback Eric Bieniemy, along with a stalwart defense that included Alfred Williams, Greg Biekert, Chad Brown and Kanavis McGhee.",
      "To think, McCartney nearly chose a basketball coaching career.",
      "Born in Riverview, Michigan, McCartney played center and linebacker at the University of Missouri, where he met his wife. He later coached basketball and football at a high school in Dearborn, Michigan. His teams were good, too, each capturing the state title in 1973.",
      "He caught the eye of Michigan football coach Bo Schembechler, who wanted McCartney to join his staff at Michigan. If that weren\u2019t enough, Michigan basketball coach Johnny Orr urged him to join his staff.",
      "He couldn\u2019t decide. His wife gave him some simple advice \u2014 follow his heart.",
      "He stepped into the world of college football.",
      "McCartney learned under Schembechler for eight seasons, until an opportunity came up to guide his own team. When the late Chuck Fairbanks left Colorado to become involved with the New Jersey Generals in the upstart U.S. Football League, McCartney asked Schembechler if the Hall of Fame coach would put in a good word for him.",
      "Schembechler\u2019s backing carried a lot of weight and then-Colorado athletic director Eddie Crowder gave McCartney the position.",
      "It was a rough start for McCartney with only seven victories in his first three seasons, including a 1-10 finish in 1984. Then things started to turn.",
      "His last season with the Buffaloes was 1994, when the team went 11-1 behind a roster that included Kordell Stewart, Michael Westbrook and the late Rashaan Salaam. That season featured the \u201cMiracle in Michigan,\u201d with Westbrook hauling in a 64-yard TD catch from Stewart on a Hail Mary as time expired in a win at Michigan. Salaam also rushed for 2,055 yards to earn the Heisman Trophy.",
      "McCartney also groomed the next wave of coaches, mentoring assistants such as Gary Barnett, Jim Caldwell, Ron Dickerson, Gerry DiNardo, Karl Dorrell, Jon Embree, Les Miles, Rick Neuheisel, Bob Simmons, Lou Tepper, Ron Vanderlinden and John Wristen.",
      "In recent years, McCartney got to watch grandson Derek play defensive line at Colorado. Derek\u2019s father, Shannon Clavelle, was a defensive lineman for Colorado from 1992-94 before playing a few seasons in the NFL. Derek\u2019s brother, T.C. McCartney, was a quarterback at LSU and is the son of late Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, who played for Bill McCartney in 1987 and \u201988 before being diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1989 and dying six months later at 21.",
      "Growing up, Derek McCartney used to go next door to his grandfather\u2019s house to listen to his stories. He never tired of them.",
      "Derek soaked up the tales about Salaam winning the Heisman Trophy and how Colorado beat Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl to cement the national title. His grandfather had a picture of the play from Michigan and a button to push to hear the broadcast audio.",
      "When playing for Colorado, hardly a day would go by when someone wouldn\u2019t ask Derek if he was somehow related to the coach.",
      "\u201cI like when that happens,\u201d Derek said.",

      "This time UCLA coach Mick Cronin turned his disdain toward the officials",
      "COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Three days after ripping his team following a home loss to Michigan, UCLA coach Mick Cronin turned his disdain toward the officials.",
      "Cronin was ejected with 5:11 remaining in a 79-61 loss at Maryland on Friday night, and he did not hold back afterward, voicing his displeasure with the officiating and Big Ten scheduling. He was far gentler on his own players than he was earlier in the week, when he called them \u201csoft\u201d and \u201cdelusional\u201d after a 19-point loss to Michigan. This time he felt they were in an unfair situation.",
      "\u201cIn defense of my guys, I didn't think we were given any chance to win in the second half,\" Cronin said. \u201cI let (official) Jeff Anderson know, I hit the showers.\u201d",
      "Cronin's outburst came with UCLA down nine after Maryland came up with a rebound. He was given two quick technicals and sent on his way.",
      "\u201cI don't remember the last time I had a technical,\" he said. \"I had enough. I'm sending a message. I'm tired of it. I know we're the outsider and all that \u2014 us, SC and Oregon \u2014 but that was ridiculous.",
      "\"And take nothing away from Maryland, a really good team at home, but you got to defend my players. If you can just mug guys and chop their arms off, throw them out of the way, it's hard to run any offense.\u201d",
      "The technical fouls led to a six-point possession for Maryland, and the game became a rout.",
      "\u201cWe needed some stronger officials on the game in my opinion, but we needed to be stronger with the ball,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cIn defense of my players, we didn't have a lot of time, we had one day to prepare.\u201d",
      "This is UCLA's first season in the Pac-12, along with Southern California, Oregon and Washington. Difficult travel was a given when those teams joined, and the Bruins are dealing with it now.",
      "They played at Nebraska on Jan. 4, returned home for one game with Michigan, then headed out for a trip to Maryland and Rutgers.",
      "\u201cWe had to travel on a five-hour-and-50-minute flight. They got home Sunday. They had two extra days,\" Cronin said. \"Now Rutgers is sitting at home and they got an extra day. I haven't mapped all this out, but I sure hope it swings our way at some point.\"",
      "After returning from Rutgers, UCLA will play seven straight games out west from Jan. 17- Feb. 8 \u2014 five home games plus trips to Washington and USC.",
      "\u201cI get it. It's probably virtually impossible to make the schedule, but I just know it hasn't been good for us,\" Cronin said. \u201cMichigan was in LA three days before we were.\u201d",
      "This has been a particularly tough week to be away, given the wildfires that have caused so much chaos in the Los Angeles area. Cronin said after he was ejected, he quickly went to check an app that gives alerts.",
      "\u201cMy house is getting real close to being evacuated,\" he said. \"When I got thrown out, I just immediately went to my phone.\u201d",

      "He's also got his young rival, Jannik Sinner, in mind.",
      "\u201cThe good thing for me is, when I\u2019m seeing him winning titles, when I\u2019m seeing him in the top of the ranking, it forces me to practice even harder every day. In practice, I\u2019m just thinking (about) the things that I have to improve to play against him,\u201d Alcaraz said Saturday, a day before the start of the Australian Open. \u201cThat, I think, is great for me: Having him (and) such a great rivalry, so far, just to (force me to) give (my best), every day.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz, 21, and Sinner, 23, head into the 2025 tennis season at the top of the men's game, coming off a year that portended greatness for both. With Rafael Nadal now joining Roger Federer in retirement, leaving 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic as the lone remaining member of the Big Three on tour, it appears as though Alcaraz and Sinner have separated themselves from the rest of the next generation, each taking two of the four Slam singles trophies in 2024.",
      "Forever, it seemed, the sport's most important laurels were dominated by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, and anyone harboring hopes of claiming then needed to defeat at least one, and often two, of that trio.",
      "The names have changed, but the dynamic is similar.",
      "\u201cI feel like now, with Jannik and with Carlos, it kind of moved toward the same way, just with new guys. You have to go through them to win big tournaments. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Alexander Zverev, a two-time major finalist who is seeded No. 2 at Melbourne Park, between No. 1 Sinner and No. 3 Alcaraz. \u201cThey both won two Grand Slams (last) year. And they\u2019re the two best players in the world, for sure. And you have to beat them to win the tournament.\u201d",
      "Sinner is the defending champion in Australia, and went on to also win the U.S. Open in September, part of a season in which he went 73-6 with eight titles \u2014 but also dealt with a doping case in which he tested positive twice for trace amounts of an anabolic steroid, blamed it on accidentally being exposed to a banned substance via a massage from his trainer and was exonerated. (The World Anti-Doping Agency appealed that ruling; a closed-door hearing will be held at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland on April 16-17.)",
      "Alcaraz exited from the Australian Open in the quarterfinals against Zverev last January, but then triumphed at the French Open, getting past Zverev in the final, and Wimbledon, where he won against Djokovic in the final for the second year in a row.",
      "On Sunday, Zverev faces wild-card entry Lucas Pouille at night, after defending champion Aryna Sabalenka takes on 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens. Other top names scheduled for Day 1 action include 2024 Australian runner-up and Paris Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen and three-time major finalist Casper Ruud.",
      "Alcaraz, Sinner and Djokovic, along with five-time major champ Iga Swiatek, will get started Monday or Tuesday.",
      "If Alcaraz, whose first major title came at the 2022 U.S. Open at age 19 and propelled him to a debut at No. 1, wins this Australian Open, he would be the youngest man in tennis history to complete a career Grand Slam, with at least one championship from each of the sport's four most prestigious events.",
      "\u201cIt's truly remarkable,\u201d former player Feliciano Lopez said, \u201cwhat he has achieved in the last three years.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz and Sinner already are establishing quite a head-to-head rivalry, one that already has shown glimpses of the potential to become as memorable as Federer vs. Nadal, or Djokovic vs. Nadal.",
      "\u201cYou have more eyes on us,\u201d Sinner said, \"because this is a match most people want to see.\"",
      "Overall, Alcaraz leads 6-4.",
      "In 2024 alone, he went 3-0 against Sinner, who was 73-3 against everyone else, with setbacks only against Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m playing against him, I have a different mindset, a little bit. I mean, when you're facing the ... best player in the world, you have to do something different \u2014 different preparation or different mindset or whatever,\" said Alcaraz, who was 54-13 with four titles last season. \"When I\u2019m facing him, I just know that I have to play my best if I want to win. That\u2019s it. Probably if I have a bad day against Jannik, it\u2019s 99% that you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d",

      "Maryland had an 11-0 run in the first half that gave the Terps lead for good. Then they added a 10-0 spurt toward the end of the game. Maryland now has 22 runs of 10-0 or better this season after producing 16 all of last season.",

      "HONOLULU -- Kensai Hirata of Japan opened with four straight birdies, and he got up-and-down for one last birdie on the 18th at Waialae for a 7-under 63 and a one-shot lead among the early starters Friday in the Sony Open.",
      "Among those right behind were figures from the last Ryder Cup outside Rome \u2014 Sepp Straka of Austria, and U.S. captain Zach Johnson.",
      "Johnson, who turns 49 next month, holed out with a 9-iron from the third fairway for eagle and shot 31 on the front nine. He wound up with a 66 and was one shot behind in a group that included Straka (66) and Lee Hodges (64).",
      "Hirata, 24, won four times last year on the Japan Golf Tour and received an exemption to the Sony Open. He was at 9-under 131.",
      "\u201cMy first time making the cut (on the PGA Tour) so just looking forward to the weekend and having fun.\u201d Hirata said.",
      "Hideki Matsuyama, who finished at 35-under par to win at Kapalua last week, had a 69 and was at 4 under. He remains in the mix to try to become the third player to sweep the Hawaii tournaments in the same year. It was most recently done by Justin Thomas in 2017.",
      "Johnson first joined the PGA Tour in 2004 at the Sony Open. Now he no longer has any status, needing an exemption from the Sony Open to get into the tournament he once won. He is writing more letters, making phone calls, asking for a spot in the field.",
      "He also has tried to simplify his game and his approach to it, and that seemed to work fine on another pleasant day at Waialae Country Club.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to play like a massive schedule this year. I don\u2019t feel like I want to or need to, obviously for priority reasons,\u201d said Johnson, who played only twice in the Fall because his son is playing high school football and he didn't want to miss a game.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for what\u2019s ahead, the work I\u2019m doing, excited what\u2019s in my bag and how I\u2019m navigating things,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm excited mentally, too. Been a fresh start. Very, very simple in my approach.\u201d",
      "The group at 6-under 134 included Gary Woodland, who a year ago returned from brain surgery to remove a lesion that was leading to seizures and unfounded fears of dying. Woodland's swing has been coming together. He says he's now seeing the golf course more clearly and building some patience into his game.",
      "\u201cI feel well, but I\u2019m on the golf course and I\u2019m in my zone and not searching for it,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cI think for a long time \u2014 most of last year \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what to expect each shot, how I was going to feel. It\u2019s just like I haven\u2019t felt this way in a long time. I\u2019m trending in the right direction. There are still some things to get better at, but it\u2019s exciting and the signs are there.\u201d",

      "Without a healthy Joel Embiid, the 76ers were never expected to contend for an NBA title",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Without a healthy Joel Embiid, the 76ers were never expected to contend for an NBA title.",
      "But get taken to the final seconds before narrowly knocking off lowly Washington?",
      "Or worse, lose to the eight-win Pelicans only hours after star forward Zion Willamson was suspended one game for breaking team rules?",
      "Philadelphia's latest worst-loss of the season came on Friday night when CJ McCollum got loose for 38 points to lead New Orleans to a 123-115 victory.",
      "A two-time NBA scoring champion, Embiid was powerless to help the Sixers again after he missed his third straight game with a sprained left foot. He has sat out a whopping 23 times already this season. He's also missed games due to left knee soreness, a sinus fracture and a three-game suspension for an altercation with a reporter in the locker room.",
      "Embiid has played in just 13 games this season. The Sixers are 7-6 with Embiid and 8-15 without him \u2014 add that up, and it's a 15-21 record for team that boasts All-Stars Paul George and Tyrese Maxey and is out of the Eastern Conference playoff standings.",
      "\u201cWe're definitely better with Joel out there, that's a fact,\u201d George said. \u201cWe're better with the big guy back in the lineup with us.\u201d",
      "Coach Nick Nurse said the team doesn\u2019t believe Embiid's injury is a long-term concern. OK, maybe the foot feels better after a week off and Embiid plays Sunday in Orlando. Given his lengthy injury history that dates to when he missed the entirety of his first two full NBA seasons, there are no guarantees Embiid can survive the rest of the NBA season unscathed.",
      "The 2022-23 NBA MVP, Embiid is averaging 24.4 points and 7.9 rebounds this season \u2014 below his career averages.",
      "George has been spotty in the first season of his four-year, $212 million contract. He's struggled with injuries and his shot in his first season in Philly and hasn't quite found the consistent groove expected out of the nine-time All-Star. Case in point, against New Orleans, George had one bucket and three fouls at 8:13 of the second quarter. In the second half, George hit five 3s and scored 23 of his 25 points.",
      "Maxey scored 30 points in 40 minutes and continues to log heavy minutes trying to carry the scoring load in Embiid's absence.",
      "\u201cIt just seemed to me like we didn't have quite the pop energy-wise we needed the full game,\u201d Nurse said.",
      "After a 3-14 start, the 76ers seemed to get themselves right by winning 10 of 13 games that included a signature Christmas win in Boston. Once the calendar flipped, the 76ers have since lost four of six.",
      "Again, the 76ers have kept the MRI machine humming.",
      "The 76ers also played without Andre Drummond (left toe sprain), Kyle Lowry (right hip strain) and KJ Martin (left foot). They ruled out promising rookie Jared McCain for the rest of the season on Thursday following left knee surgery last month on a torn meniscus.",
      "\u201cIt's difficult with guys in and out of the lineup,\u201d Maxey said. \u201cAs soon as we get some continuity, as soon as we get flowing, guys miss (games). It's really difficult. Guys have to kind of change their roles every single night. That puts pressure on us, man. We miss Jo, we miss Paul, we miss K.J. It's hard to win in this league when you're not healthy.\u201d",
      "The 20-year-old McCain spent one season at Duke before the Sixers made him their 2024 first-round draft pick. McCain \u2014 the 16th overall selection \u2014 was off to a fantastic start and had averaged 15.3 points in 23 games. He started eight games and was an instant fan favorite in large part to amassing nearly 5 million followers as a TikTok sensation.",
      "\u201cHe was not only a great pick by our organization, he was really impacting the team in a positive manner,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think any rookie picked in that range that comes in and bolts to the top of all rookies is a credit to the player and organization, as well.\u201d",
      "Can the 76ers play encased in bubble wrap?",
      "They'll need Embiid and George and Maxey at as close to full strength as they can get with a schedule looming that includes games this week against the Magic, and home games against Oklahoma City and the New York Knicks. Then they hit the road to play at Indiana, Milwaukee and Denver. All those teams have winning records.",
      "\u201cThere's sort of a desperation that we need to start to play with,\u201d George said. \u201cLook at every game like it matters. At this point forward, every game matters. It's not going to get any easier. We lost tonight. Not going to discredit how they played tonight but it's a team we should have beat. We've got to put teams like this away. That's the kind of team we've got to be if we want to compete and be one of the teams standing at the end.\u201d",

      "An appeals court has upheld the law, which bans TikTok unless it's sold.",
      "The law is set to take effect Jan. 19, the day before a new term begins for President-elect Donald Trump, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. The Republican says he wants to \u201csave TikTok.\"",

      "He took the unusual step of filing court documents asking the Supreme Court to put the law on hold so that he could negotiate a deal for the sale of TikTok after he takes office. His position marked the latest example of him inserting himself into national issues before he takes office. It also was a change from his last presidential term, when he wanted to ban it.",

Mitch McConnell, the Republican former Senate leader, and a group of 22 states have filed briefs in support, arguing that the law protects free speech by safeguarding Americans' data and preventing the possible manipulation of information on the platform by Chinese authorities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",

Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",
      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:22:30 -0500",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately",
      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

    "story": [
      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",
      "Guo expressed confidence that the people in the earthquake zone would be able to rebuild under \u201cthe strong leadership\u201d of the Communist Party.",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

      "Chipmaker Nvidia has unveiled new technology for gamers and creators at CES 2025",
      "LAS VEGAS -- In a packed Las Vegas arena, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang stood on stage and marveled over the crisp real-time computer graphics displayed on the screen behind him. He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "The chipmaker and AI darling unveiled its GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs \u2014 its most advanced consumer graphics processor units for gamers, creators and developers. The tech is designed for use on both desktop and laptop computers.",
      "Ahead of Huang's speech, Nvidia stock climbed 3.4% to top its record set in November. Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing even as criticism rises that their stock prices have already shot too high, too fast. Despite worries about a potential bubble, the industry continues to talk up its potential.",
      "Huang said the GPUs, which use the company\u2019s next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell, can deliver breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering.",
      "\u201cBlackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,\u201d Huang said, adding that Blackwell \u201cis the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.\u201d Blackwell technology is now in full production, he said.",
      "Building on the tech Nvidia released 25 years ago, the company announced that it would also introduce \u201cRTX Neural Shaders,\u201d which use AI to help render game characters in deep detail \u2013 a task that's notoriously tricky because people can easily spot a small error on digital humans.",
      "Huang said Nvidia is also introducing a new suite of technologies that enable \u201cautonomous characters\u201d to perceive, plan and act like human players. Those characters can help players plan strategies or adapt tactics to challenge players and create more dynamic battles.",
      "In addition to Nvidia, tech giants such as AMD, Google and Samsung are at CES 2025 to unveil artificial intelligence tools aimed at helping both content creators and consumers alike in their quest for entertainment.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:56:34 -0500",
    "summary": "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition and other plaintiffs sued, winning a preliminary injunction that blocks the attorney general from enforcement while court proceedings continue. However, the coalition expressed concern that private lawsuits or actions by individual district attorneys could be possible.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Lipman wrote that parental controls on minors' devices are more effective and less restrictive.",
      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

      "The multi-day event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas \u2014 where swaths of the latest gadgets and advances across industries like personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more are set to be on display. And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 21:53:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump was sentenced in New York on Friday, capping a long and, at times, embarrassing ordeal that saw him become the first ex-president to be criminally convicted.",
    "story": [
      "Trump will be the first president to enter office with a criminal record.",
      "For the six weeks Donald Trump spent in a Manhattan courtroom for his criminal hush money trial last year, the former president never spoke a word on the record.",
      "That changed Friday at the president-elect's sentencing.",
      "Trump originally faced up to four years in prison after being convicted of falsifying business records as part of an alleged scheme to influence the 2016 election by paying off an adult film actress who said she had a long-denied affair with Trump in 2006, three months after his wife gave birth to his youngest son.",
      "Appearing virtually in the same courtroom where the trial took place, Trump -- now the president-elect -- used Friday's sentencing hearing to unleash a seven-minute recitation of his grievances with the criminal justice system.",
      "He proclaimed his innocence, bragged about his election victory, accused prosecutors of engaging in a political witch hunt, criticized his former lawyer and home state, and contrasted his experience with an ongoing natural disaster.",
      "\"With all that's happening in our country today, with a city that's burning to the ground -- one of our largest, most important cities burning to the ground -- with wars that are uncontrollably going on, with all of the problems of inflation and attacks on countries, and all of the horrible things that are going on, I got indicted over calling a legal expense a legal expense,\" said Trump.",
      "The unprecedented hearing -- which Trump attended virtually from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida -- capped off a yearslong tumultuous and, at times, embarrassing ordeal that resulted in him becoming the first former president to be criminally convicted. While the sentencing cemented his status as a convicted criminal, Trump suggested that his electoral victory in November amounted to a political acquittal, claiming voters' support for him was a wholesale rejection of what he called the \"weaponization of government.\"",
      "\"The people of our country got to see this firsthand because they watched the case in your courtroom,\" said Trump, who vowed to appeal the verdict. \"They got to see this firsthand and then they voted, and I won and got the largest number of votes by far, of any Republican candidate in history.\"",
      "Due to Trump's electoral victory and his forthcoming presidential immunity, Judge Juan Merchan imposed what he said was the \"only lawful sentence\" of an unconditional discharge. The unusual sentence -- which carried no punishment for Trump's actions -- finalized the judgment against Trump, allowing him to appeal.",
      "Merchan suggested that Trump would have received a stiffer sentence had he been a private citizen -- but that the \"extraordinary legal protections\" provided by the office of the presidency left him no other options.",
      "\"It is the office of the president that bestows those far-reaching protections to the office holder, and it was the citizenry of this nation that recently decided that you should once again receive the benefits of those protections, which include, among other things, the Supremacy Clause and presidential immunity,\" said Merchan.",
      "But Merchan was clear that while Trump's status as president-elect limited his sentencing options, it did not change the fact that a jury of twelve New Yorker's convicted the former president for what Merchan described in a filing last week as a \"premeditated and continuous deception.\"",
      "\"Despite the extraordinary breadth of those protections, one power they do not provide is a power to erase a jury verdict,\" Merchan told the courtroom Friday.",
      "Merchan had previously, in a court filing, criticized Trump for his \"disdain for the Third Branch of government\" and \"lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole.\" But the judge refrained from explicitly criticizing Trump during Friday's hearing.",
      "Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass felt otherwise. The assistant Manhattan DA said that Trump \"caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system and has placed officers of the court in harm's way.\"",
      "\"Instead of preserving, protecting, and defending our constitutionally-established system of criminal justice, the defendant -- the once and future president of the United States -- has engaged in a coordinated campaign to undermine its legitimacy,\" Steinglass said.",
      "According to Steinglass, the probation officer who interviewed Trump last year found that Trump \"sees himself as above the law and won't accept responsibility for his actions.\" Steinglass highlighted that Trump threatened to retaliate against prosecutors, criticized the trial as corrupt and a sham \"too many times to tabulate,\" and made \"unrelenting\" attacks on the justice system.",
      "\"Far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct, the defendant has purposefully bred disdain for our judicial institutions and the rule of law, and he's done this to serve his own ends and to encourage others to reject the jury verdict that he finds so distasteful,\" Steinglass said.",
      "Despite all that, Steinglass said that the Manhattan district attorney recommended against any punishment for the former president, adopting the same reasoning as Judge Merchan.",
      "\"The American public has the right to a presidency unencumbered by pending court proceedings or ongoing sentence-related obligations,\" Steinglass said.",
      "Nineteen months after Trump was indicted, Merchan ended the sentencing with a kind remark to the defendant who would in ten days become the president of the United States.",
      "\"Sir, I wish you Godspeed as you assume your second term in office. Thank you,\" Merchan said.",

      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d",
      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",

You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",

      "Children may be confused, scared, or overwhelmed by what they're hearing and seeing, and it's important for parents and caregivers to help them process these emotions.",
      "Natural disasters\u2014whether fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods\u2014can be deeply unsettling for children whether or not they are directly impacted. Their understanding of the world is still developing, and events like these can challenge their sense of safety and stability.",
      "Here are some practical, research-backed ways to talk to children about natural disasters while keeping their emotional well-being\u2014and your own\u2014in mind.",
      "Be honest, but keep it age-appropriate",
      "Children don't need all the details, but they do need honesty. Dr. Tamar Kahane, licensed clinical psychologist and founder of The Kahane Center, an integrated mental health center providing comprehensive psychological and neuro-psychological services, emphasizes the importance of honesty while also validating children's fears.",
      "\"Start by acknowledging and validating their feelings and the reality. It is scary. It's not your job to pretend that everything is okay when it's not,\" she told \"Good Morning America.\"",
      "For younger kids, keep explanations simple and reassuring: \"Fires are really scary and can be very dangerous, but thankfully, firefighters are working hard to put them out, and it's our job as your parent to keep you safe.\"",
      "Older children may have more questions\u2014answer them calmly and factually, but avoid overwhelming them with too much information. You can share and explain all the safety measures you have in place, Kahane said.",
      "Trauma therapist Diane Lang advises tailoring answers to each child's maturity level.",
      "\"You want your answers to be very age-appropriate, knowing your child's maturity level. Keep it as simple as possible, and encourage them to ask any questions,\" she told \"GMA.\"",
      "If a question doesn't have an answer, it's okay to say, \"I don't know, but we can learn about it together.\" This approach helps children feel supported while modeling problem-solving and curiosity in the face of uncertainty.",
      "Validate their emotions",
      "Natural disasters can bring up a range of emotions in children\u2014fear, sadness, anger or even confusion. Let them know it's okay to feel how they feel. Use phrases like, \"It's normal to feel scared right now,\" or \"It's understandable to feel upset about what's happening.\"",
      "Kahane advises, \"Parents often feel they need to protect their children from experiencing scary things, but it's more helpful to acknowledge their emotions. When children feel heard and understood, they are better able to cope.\"",
      "She adds that regression\u2014like tantrums, clinginess, or whining\u2014is common under stress: \"Keep in mind, 'under stress, regress.' Now is the time to hear them, hug them and understand where the acting out is coming from.\"",
      "Lang emphasizes the importance of truly listening to children's fears: \"You want to validate their feelings, listen to their fears and make sure they know you're listening,\" she said. \"Eye contact is important, and you want to remind them that their feelings and concerns are completely normal and natural.\"",
      "Validating emotions reassures children that their feelings are normal and that they're not alone.",
      "Stick to routines",
      "During times of uncertainty, routines provide children with a sense of stability.",
      "Keeping bedtimes, meals and other daily rituals as consistent as possible helps reinforce predictability and security, even when life feels uncertain.",
      "\"Try and stick to their routines as much as you can,\" Kahane said. \"This will help you and your child feel more safe and grounded. For older children try and make sure they maintain their academic and after school routines and social connections as best as possible.\"",
      "Empower kids with action",
      "When faced with events they can't control, children may feel helpless. Involve them in small, meaningful actions to give them a sense of control and contribution.",
      "Andy Bozzo, Battalion Chief of Contra Costa County Fire Protection District and co-founder of Tablet Command, a mobile incident command and response solution, recommends practicing emergency preparedness at home as a way to empower children.",
      "\"Practice makes perfect,\" he told \"GMA.\" \"One of the fundamental elements of an emergency plan is practicing multiple escape routes from a home and a meeting place, once out of the house. Helping children gain confidence in their ability to escape a burning home is critical.\"",
      "In addition to practicing escape plans, encourage children to take on small but meaningful roles in the process. For example, assign them a specific responsibility during a fire drill or evacuation, like grabbing the family's emergency kit or helping a younger sibling.",
      "\"Parents and children should practice together and become familiar with procedures, routes, and landmarks,\" Bozzo said. \"Everyone, even children, should be empowered with a job or a role in that escape plan. Finally, a meeting place outside the home is paramount for accountability.\"",
      "By practicing together, families can reduce the chaos and anxiety that often accompany real emergencies.",

      "Writing thank-you notes or draw pictures for first responders.",
      "Exploring ways to help affected communities, like donating to relief efforts.",
      "Limit media exposure",
      "While it's important to stay informed, constant exposure to news coverage\u2014especially images or videos of destruction\u2014can increase fear and anxiety in children. Monitor what they're watching, and if possible, limit their exposure altogether.",
      "\"Children do not have the capacity to process these images emotionally. Too much exposure can flood them and lead to separation anxiety and other struggles,\" Kahane said.",
      "Instead, focus on calming activities that help restore a sense of normalcy, such as family game nights, reading or creative projects.",
      "Lang advises limiting not only children's media exposure but also how much the disaster is discussed within the family. \"You want to limit their media exposure, as well as you and your spouse or other siblings talking about it too much around them,\" she said.",
      "Take care of yourself too",

    "story": [
      "\u201c20/20\u201d looks at the disappearance of Michael Shaver.",
      "Michael and Laurie Shaver were middle school sweethearts, both from upstate New York. After the couple married, they moved to Clermont, Florida, rearing their two children on their rural property. Michael Shaver worked as a monorail technician at Walt Disney World, while Laurie Shaver worked from home for an insurance company.",
      "In his spare time, Michael Shaver raced airplanes with a local flight team called Precious Metal across the country.",
      "\u201cHe was so happy,\u201d Michael Shaver\u2019s sister Stacie Turner recalled in a \u201c20/20\u201d interview. \u201cHe was in a whole different zone when he was working on his plane.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 7, 2015, Michael Shaver, 33, attended a local tractor show with his family and co-worker Frank Merritt. Merritt noted palpable tension between the husband and wife. Merritt told \u201c20/20\u201d he thought little of the couple\u2019s demeanor until the following week: Michael Shaver was a no-show at work three days in a row.",
      "Through a text message, Merritt said he learned his co-worker was quitting his job to \u201csave his marriage.\u201d",
      "Concerned, Merritt visited the family home to check on his co-worker, where he said Laurie Shaver revealed her husband left her \u2013 and she had no idea where he went.",
      "\u201cHe was here one moment, gone the next, type of thing,\u201d Merritt described. \u201cNo goodbye...He was just gone.\u201d",
      "That text message turned out to be the first in a series of disconcerting messages friends and family members would apparently receive from Michael Shaver over the course of the next two and a half years. The common theme of the messages was \u201cleave me alone\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t have family.\u201d",
      "A new \u201c20/20\u201d episode airing January 10 at 9 p.m. ET, and streaming the next day on Hulu, explores the mysterious disappearance and murder of Michael Shaver and the stunning revelations in Laurie Shaver\u2019s murder trial, including exclusive interviews with law enforcement, prosecutors, family members of the victim and those who witnessed the investigation unfold firsthand.",
      "Laurie Shaver said she began dating a married veteran, Jereme Townsend, when she and Michael were separated. The relationship ended abruptly when Vanessa Townsend, Townsend\u2019s wife, received a strange flower delivery accompanied by a note informing her of the affair.",
      "The message read, \u201cRoses are red. Violets are blue. My wife is a whore. Your husband is to [sic]. Sorry about this. Check your Facebook message. We need to talk. Mike.\u201d Investigators would later discover the flowers were paid for through Laurie Shaver\u2019s bank account.",
      "By February 2018, Michael\u2019s longtime friend, Scott Amatuccio, became concerned that no one had physically seen or spoken to Michael Shaver in more than two years. Amatuccio requested law enforcement perform a welfare check.",
      "When investigators arrived at Laurie Shaver\u2019s home and surveyed the backyard, they noticed a depression the size of a human body in a cement slab near the fire pit. They later returned with a search warrant, excavation equipment and cadaver dogs.",
      "Authorities discovered Michael Shaver\u2019s skeletal remains buried in the backyard, wrapped in a sheet. He had a single gunshot wound to the back of his head.",
      "The backyard was the same site where Laurie had married her current husband, Travis Filmer, a little over a year earlier. The couple had even etched their initials on the cement slab near the fire pit. In his first television interview, Filmer told \u201c20/20\u201d he could not come to terms with her arrest and that Laurie never told him there was a body on the property.",
      "\u201cYes, they're saying that they found a body on the property. Yes, they're saying that Laurie had some major involvement in this. There's always two sides to a story,\" Filmer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind...she didn\u2019t kill Michael.\"",
      "On Sept. 12, 2024, Michael and Laurie Shaver\u2019s 15-year-old daughter Isabelle took the witness stand in front of a quiet courtroom in Tavares, Florida. Her mother, who was on trial for murder, watched from the defense table.",
      "\u201cDo you know anything about the death of your father?\u201d Laurie Shaver\u2019s defense attorney, Jeffrey Wiggs, asked Isabelle.",
      "\u201cI do,\u201d she responded clearly.",
      "Isabelle Shaver described a violent confrontation she claimed she witnessed as a 7-year-old between her father and her mother on the back porch of the family\u2019s 5-acre property.",
      "\u201cI heard my mom screaming for help,\u201d Isabelle Shaver testified, \"and so I went to my mom\u2019s room and went to her end table...I grabbed her gun...and I shot him.\u201d",
      "During the trial, Wiggs told the jury that after Isabelle Shaver shot her father, Jereme Townsend happened upon the scene, took the gun from Isabelle\u2019s hands and fired a second shot at Michael Shaver. Wiggs went on to claim that Townsend disposed of Michael Shaver\u2019s body.",
      "\u201c[Jereme Townsend] tells me to take the kids, get them out of the house, and he would take care of it,\u201d Laurie Shaver testified in court. \u201cHe insinuated that if we said anything...he was not going to take the blame for this.\u201d",
      "During his testimony, Townsend denied shooting Michael Shaver or taking part in the disposal of his remains in any way. He said he was not at the Shaver home during the shooting or its aftermath. He testified that Laurie had told him that she was going through a divorce and that Michael had \u201cleft with a friend in a vehicle.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors Nick Camuccio and Rich Buxman argued that Townsend and Isabelle had no involvement in Michael\u2019s murder. Prosecutors alleged that Laurie Shaver acted alone, saying she impersonated Michael Shaver for over two years after she killed him, sending those messages to friends and family, posting on Michael Shaver\u2019s personal Facebook account and sending the flower delivery to Vanessa Townsend.",
      "\u201cWe have the defendant's husband buried in her own backyard,\u201d prosecutor Rich Buxman said to \u201c20/20.\u201d \u201cThat points directly to Laurie Shaver.\u201d",
      "On Sept. 13, 2024, a jury convicted Laurie Shaver of second-degree murder and she was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "After the trial, Michael Shaver\u2019s family expressed relief at the verdict.",
      "\u201cMichael was such a great, great person,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHe loved everybody with all that he had, and I think his spirit will finally be able to be at peace.\u201d"

    "title": "Struggling to keep your New Year's resolutions? Here's how to keep yourself on track",
    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 05:18:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Why do millions make New Year's resolutions knowing the odds of them ever following through with them are minimal? Fitness expert Jasper Rook Williams has some advice.",
    "story": [
      "\"Your goal might be set in stone, but how you achieve it shouldn't be.\"",
      "LONDON -- It is one thing to make a New Year's resolution. It is, however, a very different thing to be able to keep it.",
      "Every year they are made with the best of intentions -- with the hope and desire to become a better version of ourselves -- so why is it that millions of people make New Year's resolutions knowing the odds of them ever following through with them are minimal?",
      "Jasper Rook Williams -- fitness expert, online coach and owner of JRW Fitness -- has made a successful career so far working with hundreds of clients around the world on improving their nutrition, training and lifestyle calibration. He has a good idea why.",
      "\"The goals, if sometimes a little ambitious, are rarely the problem and they are all set with best intentions,\" Rook Williams tells ABC News. \"The issue is there's rarely enough thought put into the approach. People have high ambitions hinging on mostly unrealistic and unsustainable methods. Rather than just thinking 'I'll eat salads and join a gym', people need to prioritize achievable routines, sustainability and lifestyle changes from a broader and more holistic perspective.\"",
      "According to research, Rook Williams isn't wrong. The failure rate for New Year's resolutions is said to be an estimated 80% with most people losing their resolve and motivation just weeks later in mid-February, according to U.S News and World Report.",
      "\"Changing your habits is very difficult, including finding the right moment to make a change,\" Bas Verplanken, professor of social psychology at the University of Bath, said in a report released by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in 2017. \"Changing from December 31st to January 1st is not a dramatic discontinuity. Many resolutions are made on December 31st, and go down the drain on January 2nd.\"",
      "Psychologically speaking, the beginning of a new year is often viewed as a seminal moment -- a time to reflect on the previous year and look ahead to the new one. But this doesn't necessarily translate to immediate change and action just because of timing.",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the top three New Year's resolutions made each year are living healthier (23%), personal improvement or happiness (21%) and losing weight (20%), according to a report published by Statista in Nov. 2022.",
      "\"A great question to ask yourself when starting out is \"does this feel sustainable?\" Rook Williams explains to ABC News. \"If you can't keep up the routine then you definitely won't keep the results.\"",
      "One of the things that Rook Williams has found leads to people maintaining their success is when people have -- or are given -- a sense of accountability.",
      "\"You have to bear in mind that creating new habits is hard and progress for anything worthwhile is never linear,\" he said. \"There will be times when either you want to stop or results seem to have stopped and that can be hard to deal with. That's when having someone to guide you can keep you accountable can be invaluable in the process of change.\"",
      "Ultimately, to successfully make a change for the better, it comes down to striking the right balance, according to Rook Williams.",
      "\"In the case of fitness, it's not just the food or training or wider lifestyle that will create the change but all three of these things working together,\" he continued. \"They're not mutually exclusive. Lacking motivation is common and, in my experience, is something that comes when you don't have a plan. Whether you hire a professional or not, just removing the guesswork and gaining a sense of direction always helps the individual on their path to success.\"",
      "One of the biggest obstacles to maintaining resolutions, particularly when it comes to fitness objectives, is to choose goals that are both achievable and sustainable.",
      "An estimated 12% of all new gym memberships per year occur in January, according to a study done by IHRSA, the fitness industry's only global trade association that represents health clubs worldwide. Another study indicates that four out of every five people who join the gym in January will actually quit within five months.",
      "\"Motivation is temporary for everyone,\" says Rook Williams. \"So the best thing you can do is use that time to create the habits and routines needed to see you through once it wanes. And it will wane. It always does. The classic thing new gym starters do in the new year is go from zero to 100 mph \u2026 They want to go from not working out at all and eating what they want to training five, six, seven days a week and eating like a rabbit. This just sets them up for failure because it's just not realistic.\"",
      "One of the biggest reasons why Rook Williams' clients often succeed when it comes to setting goals is the focus on maintaining a healthy outlook every day and \"saying no to short-termism.\"",
      "\"Being new at something and hoping to be perfect straight away is a sure fire way to give up on anything very quickly,\" Rook Williams explains. \"Be sure to cut yourself some slack. If you planned to train three days one week but only managed two, that doesn't make you a failure. It's still two more than you were doing before, so just wipe the slate clean and try it again without holding on to guilt or punishing yourself.\"",
      "\"Everyone falls off the horse at some point, even the pros,\" Rook Williams continued. \"What's important is how quickly you dust yourself off and get back to work. Those who make it do this right away. But those who let one mistake spill over into more mistakes are the ones who are most likely to give up and start again next year.\"",
      "No matter what resolution you may make in the New Year, for Rook Williams, success is all about perspective and making changes in incremental ways that suit your lifestyle rather than completely disrupting it.",
      "\"There is never just one solution to a problem, whatever that problem might be,\" he continued. \"Your goal might be set in stone, but how you achieve it shouldn't be. Don't get married to just one method. Finding sustainable success is all about finding the method that is easiest and most maintainable for you.\"",
      "Unrealistic expectations and the dangers of expecting to get it right the first time are one of the main things that Rook Williams warns his clients about.",
      "\"With so much conflicting information out there and each of us having our own unique goals, schedules and responsibilities, the chance of getting your nutritional approach spot on when going alone immediately is incredibly slim,\" Rook Williams explains. \"Even if it is working, it might not be sustainable so be prepared for a period involving a lot of trial and error.\"",
      "For Rook Williams this was a huge reason why he became a coach in the first place. \"It took me ages to piece it all together and, once I had, I wanted to help others do the same and in far less time.\"",
      "Research actually backs this up. According to a 2012 study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Weight and Eating Disorders Program, 65% of dieters return to their pre-diet weight within three years and only 5% of people who lose weight on a restrictive diet, such as a liquid or no-carb, manage to keep the weight off -- just one out of every 20 dieters.",
      "\"Carbs are tasty, alcohol can be fun, food is for eating and going without all these things forever is, for most people, totally unrealistic. When you think about it logically like that, it's no surprise the majority of people fail to keep off the weight they lose.\"",
      "Ultimately, making any major change in your life requires more than just the desire to do so. It requires a goal, determination and a willingness to learn all mixed with a heavy dose of reality and a well-constructed approach to change.",
      "\"If you have a day where you feel like you can't be bothered with anything, remember you are running your own race,\" Rook Williams explains. \"Success isn't made by being perfect everyday but by doing your best everyday, whatever that looks like to you. What I have learned myself -- and what I have really seen leads people to success -- is if you have good habits and routines in place that you have created over time, that's what is going to get you to where you want to be.\"",
      "Said Rook Williams: \"It's not just the food or training or wider lifestyle that will create the change but all three of these things. They're all connected.\"",

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Calmer winds enabled firefighters to start gaining some control of the biggest blazes in metropolitan LA on Friday before gusty weather returns over the weekend to an area that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months. But by Friday evening, new evacuations were issued in an area that includes The Getty museum as the eastern side of the Palisades Fire flared up, nearing Interstate 405.",

      "Officials on Friday set up a center where people could report those missing. Tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders, and the fires have consumed about 56 square miles (145 square kilometers).",
      "The disaster took homes from everyone \u2014 from waiters to movie stars. The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the damage, but private firms have estimated it will climb into the tens of billions. The Walt Disney Co. announced Friday it will donate $15 million to respond to the fires and help rebuild.",
      "The flames hit schools, churches, a synagogue, libraries, boutiques, bars, restaurants, banks and local landmarks like the Will Rogers\u2019 Western Ranch House and a Queen Anne-style mansion in Altadena that dated back to 1887 and was commissioned for wealthy mapmaker Andrew McNally.",
      "Neighbors wandered around ruins Friday as they described now-vanished bedrooms, recently remodeled kitchens and outdoor living spaces. Some talked about the gorgeous views that drew them to their properties, their words contrasting sharply with the scene of soot and ash.",
      "In the coastal community of Pacific Palisades, Greg Benton surveyed where he lived for 31 years, hoping to find his great-grandmother\u2019s wedding ring in the wreckage.",
      "\u201cWe just had just had Christmas morning right over here, right in front of that chimney. And this is what\u2019s left,\u201d he said, pointing to the blackened rubble that was once his living room. \u201cIt\u2019s those small family heirlooms that are the ones that really hurt the most.\u201d",
      "Elsewhere in the city, people at collection sites picked through cardboard boxes of donated items to restart their lives.",
      "Firefighters on Friday afternoon had made progress for the first time on the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 7,000 structures. Officials said Friday most evacuation orders for the area were lifted.",
      "LA Mayor Karen Bass, who faces a critical test of her leadership as her city endures its greatest crisis in decades, said several smaller fires also were stopped.",
      "Crews earlier Friday had been gaining ground on the Palisades Fire, which burned 5,300 structures and is the most destructive in LA's history.",
      "California National Guard troops arrived on the streets of Altadena before dawn to help protect property in the fire evacuation zone, and evening curfews were in effect to prevent looting after several earlier arrests.",
      "The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that regularly confronts massive wildfires.",
      "Anna Yeager said she and her husband agonized over going back to their beloved Altadena neighborhood near Pasadena after fleeing with their 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son, their two dogs and some clothes. A neighbor told them their house was gone.",
      "Now she regrets not grabbing her children\u2019s artwork, her husband\u2019s treasured cookbooks, family photos, and jewelry from her mom, who died in 2012, and her husband\u2019s grandmother, who survived Auschwitz.",
      "When the couple returned, they saw blocks of only \u201cchimney after chimney.\"",
      "\"Power lines everywhere. Fires still going everywhere\u201d she said, adding that when they walked up to their home \u201cit was just dust.\u201d",
      "Charred grapefruits littered their yard around a blackened tree, a few still hanging from its branches.",
      "Yeager\u2019s neighborhood of Tudor homes was planning to celebrate its 100th anniversary in May.",
      "\u201cYou build a world for yourself and your family, and you feel safe in that world and things like this happen that you cannot control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\"",
      "There were remnants of the front porch where Yeager had photographed her children nearly daily since 2020 and had planned to keep doing that until they reached high school. That gave her hope.",
      "\u201cThe porch is still there and it\u2019s to me, it\u2019s a sign to rebuild and not leave,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m still here. You can still do this.\u2019\u201d",

      "Animal owners in Los Angeles have scrambled to get themselves and their beloved companions out of the way of fast-moving wildfires this week that have incinerated whole neighborhoods",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Arianna Buturovic kept a wary eye on distant smoke from the rescue shelter she runs outside Los Angeles for dogs at risk of being euthanized. Within hours, nearby mountains were ablaze and fire began encircling her.",
      "\u201cI stuffed 15 dogs in a black Prius and two cats,\u201d Buturovic said.",
      "But she still had nine more dogs and a pig to evacuate, so flagged down some 18-year-olds with a truck who agreed to take them to a shelter. She couldn\u2019t bring two ponies with her, but she left the corral open so they could escape if needed.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how we evacuated almost 30 animals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201d",
      "Buturovic is one of many animal owners in Los Angeles who scrambled to get themselves and their beloved companions out of the way of fast-moving wildfires that killed 11 people and burned more than 12,000 homes and other structures this week. It has overwhelmed shelters, whose leaders have implored people, if they're able, to find friends or family to foster their pets.",
      "Wendy Winter and her husband decided Tuesday evening that they should buy some cat carriers so they could evacuate their Altadena home with their felines Purry Mason and Jerry. Less than two hours later, it was clear they needed to leave. The next morning, they learned the house they lived in for more than seven years was gone along with the rest of their street.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s fear and loss and you just don\u2019t even know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re hoping to find friends to foster their cats for two months while they figure out what they\u2019re going to do next. Winter said she and her husband are disoriented, and they aren't sure they can provide their cats an environment where they will feel safe and comfortable right now.",
      "Some people took their pets to shelters because they couldn\u2019t evacuate with them.",
      "The Pasadena Humane Society took in 250 pets in the first day after the fires started. Los Angeles County Animal Care was looking after 97 pets \u2014 mostly cats and dogs but also pigs, a turtle, a bird, and a snake, said Christopher Valles, a department spokesperson.",
      "Veterinarian Dr. Annie Harvilicz had been moving out of an old Animal Wellness Centers office in Marina del Rey, but inspired by her brother's need to find a place for his pets, she turned the exam, X-ray and surgery rooms into an impromptu shelter. She quickly took in 41 dogs, cats and a bunny and soon found foster homes for all but two.",
      "She told people on Facebook to contact her if they needed a place for their animals. She expected an onslaught of pets needing refuge but instead has been inundated with people wanting to volunteer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the people of Los Angeles and how I really feel like they\u2019ve stepped up to the plate when it comes to helping out each other,\u201d she said.",
      "Some people wanted Harvilicz to take their donkeys but she wasn\u2019t able to get a trailer to them before they had to evacuate. Difficulties transporting larger animals puts them at greater risk from wildfires, she said.",
      "Julia Bagan, who is part of a Facebook group called Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation, found five horses locked in their stalls in Altadena one day after the fire. The horses huddled in a small exterior pen attached to the stalls but couldn\u2019t entirely escape the flames.",
      "By the time a neighbor called for help and firefighters used bolt cutters to free them, one of the horses was badly hurt, Bagan said.",
      "She drove through the remnants of the fire Wednesday night to rescue them as damaged power lines sparked overhead. She described it as \u201cthe most crazy, dangerous\u201d evacuation she\u2019s had yet. Almost all the houses in the area had burned when she pulled up.",
      "The injured horse, a 3-year-old black mare she decided to name after the movie Flicka, had leg burns. Her halter burned off, along with her tail and mane. The embers gave her eyes ulcers.",
      "A veterinarian at an emergency equine hospital gave the horse 50-50 odds of surviving.",
      "\u201cShe just had no chance, getting left locked in a stall and her owners evacuating and just leaving them all there,\u201d Bagan said.",
      "But some horse owners were ready.",
      "When Meredith McKenzie got a notice days before of the heightened fire risk, she asked people at her barn to help evacuate her horse so she could focus on caring for her sister who has Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "\u201cHorse people are not stupid about if there\u2019s fire coming. We\u2019re out before it starts because once that smoke happens, the horses go nuts and go crazy,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to corral them because they just want to run.\u201d",
      "The ranch where she kept her horses, the historic Bob Williams Ranch on Cheney Trail, burned, she said. McKenzie lost her equipment but another ranch has said they\u2019ll give her a saddle and bridle.",
      "Suzanne Cassel evacuated Tuesday from Topanga with her two horses, a donkey named Oscar Nelson, four dogs and two cats. They rushed to nab a spot at a large animal emergency shelter at Pierce College, a community college in Woodlands Hills.",
      "Her horses are together in the shelter, while the dogs and cats are staying in the horse trailer. Her donkey, though, was feeling down in a stall by himself.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lonely, so I just went inside and sat in the stall with him for half an hour, and he liked that because nobody likes to be alone when you\u2019re a herd animal,\u201d she said.",
      "Buturovic, who runs the dog rescue shelter, took some of her canines to Harvilicz\u2019s old hospital and others to a friend\u2019s home in Venice.",
      "By the time she returned to the Topanga ranch Wednesday morning, it had burned. The cement building that withstood two or three other fires since the 1950\u2019s was covered in soot, its roof gone and windows blown out. Her ponies disappeared, along with two semi-feral dogs she fed. She\u2019s hoping to raise money to support Philozoia, her non-profit organization that rescues animals from high-kill shelters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to go from here,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to introduce more Christianity to public school classrooms, testing the separation of church and state",
      "WASHINGTON -- Conservative lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to introduce more Christianity to public school classrooms, testing the separation of church and state by inserting Bible references into reading lessons and requiring teachers to post the Ten Commandments.",
      "The efforts come as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office pledging to champion the First Amendment right to pray and read the Bible in school, practices that are already allowed as long as they are not government-sponsored.",
      "While the federal government is explicitly barred from directing states on what to teach, Trump can indirectly influence what is taught in public schools and his election may embolden state-level activists.",
      "Trump and his fellow Republicans support school choice, hoping to expand the practice of using taxpayer-funded vouchers to help parents send their children to religious schools.",
      "But there is a parallel push to incorporate more Christianity into the mainstream public schools that serve the overwhelming majority of students, including those of other faiths. And with the help of judicial appointees from Trump's first presidential term, courts have begun to bless the notion of more religion in the public sphere, including in schools.",
      "\u201cThe effect of even Trump being the president-elect, let alone the president again, is Christian nationalists are emboldened like never before,\u201d said Rachel Laser, the president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.",
      "Large numbers of Americans believe the founders intended the U.S. to be a Christian nation. A smaller group, part of a movement widely called Christian nationalism, champions a fusion of American and Christian identity and believes the U.S. has a mandate to build an explicitly Christian society.",
      "Many historians argue the opposite, claiming the framers created the United States as an alternative to European monarchies with official state churches and oppression of religious minorities.",
      "Efforts to introduce more Christianity into classrooms have taken hold in several states.",
      "In Louisiana, Republicans passed a law requiring every public school classroom to post the Ten Commandments, which begin with \u201cI am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\u201d Families have sued.",
      "In Texas, officials in November approved a curriculum intertwining language arts with biblical lessons. And in Oklahoma, the state superintendent of education has called for lessons to incorporate the Bible from grades 5 through 12, a requirement schools have declined to follow.",
      "Utah state lawmakers designated the Ten Commandments as a historic document, in the same category as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, so teachers could post it in their classrooms. Many other states have seen legislation that would put them in more classrooms. And attorneys general from 17 GOP-led states recently filed a brief supporting Louisiana's Ten Commandments mandate.",
      "Schools are permitted \u2014 and even encouraged \u2014 to teach about religion and to expose students to religious texts. But some say the new measures are indoctrinating students, not educating them.",
      "Critics have raised concerns also about proliferating lesson plans. Some states have allowed teachers to use videos from Prager U, a nonprofit founded by a conservative talk show host, despite criticism that the videos positively highlight the spread of Christianity and include Christian nationalist talking points.",
      "During his first administration, Trump commissioned the 1776 Project, a report that attempted to promote a more patriotic version of American history. It was panned by historians and scholars who said it credited Christianity for many of the positive turns in U.S. history without mentioning the religion's role in perpetuating slavery, for example.",
      "The project was developed into a curriculum by the conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan and is now taught in a network pf publicly funded charter schools supported by the college. It also has influenced state standards in South Dakota.",
      "Challenges to some state measures are now working their way through the courts, which have grown friendlier to religious interests thanks to Trump's judicial appointments.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a football coach in Washington state who was fired for praying with players at midfield after a game, saying the school district infringed on his rights to religious expression. Dissenting justices noted some players felt pressure to join the coach. But the high court said a public school can't restrict an employee's religious activity just because it could be construed as an endorsement of religion, reversing a five-decade precedent.",
      "The ruling could pave the way for conservatives to introduce more Christianity in public schools, said Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s judicial appointees have emboldened states\u201d to test the separation of church and state, he said.",
      "In the wake of the football coach's case, courts now analyze church-state separation through the lens of history, said Joseph Davis of Becket, a public interest law firm focused on religious freedom that is defending Louisiana over its Ten Commandments mandate.",
      "The Supreme Court has endorsed the idea that \u201cit\u2019s OK to have religious expression in the public spaces,\" Davis said, \"and that we should sort of expect that ... if it\u2019s a big part of our history.\u201d",
      "Critics say some measures to introduce more historical references to Christianity in classrooms have taken things too far, inserting biblical references gratuitously, while erasing the role Christianity played in justifying atrocities perpetuated by Americans, like genocide of Native people.",
      "These are among the criticisms facing the new reading curriculum in Texas. Created by the state, districts aren't required to use it, but they receive financial incentives for adopting it.",
      "\u201cThe authors appear to go out of their way to work detailed Bible lessons into the curriculum even when they are both unnecessary and unwarranted,\u201d religious studies scholar David R. Brockman wrote in a report on the material. \u201cThough religious freedom is vital to American democracy, the curriculum distorts its role in the nation\u2019s founding while underplaying the importance of other fundamental liberties cherished by Americans.\u201d",
      "Texas Values, a conservative think tank that backed the new reading curriculum, said in a statement that the court's pivot toward permitting more Christianity in schools, and allowing more taxpayer money to flow to religious institutions, is corrective.",
      "The football coach case has rightfully returned protections for religion and free speech in public school, said Jonathan Saenz, the Texas Values president.",
      "\u201cVoters and lawmakers (are) getting tired of the attacks on God and our heritage of being \u2018One Nation Under God,'\u201d he said.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- With an outdoor public inauguration ceremony canceled due to winter weather, new North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein instead planned to kick off his term in office with a televised address indoors.",
      "Stein was to deliver a speech on Saturday in Raleigh, instead of the originally scheduled swearing-in ceremony outside the old Capitol building for the Democratic governor and other statewide executive branch officials within what is called the Council of State.",
      "Forecasts for snow, sleet and freezing rain Friday and parts of Saturday prompted the state inaugural committee to call off public festivities, including a block party that could be rescheduled. Official inauguration parties Friday and Saturday night also were postponed.",
      "Stein and several Council of State members \u2014 the lieutenant governor, attorney general and state treasurer among them \u2014 had already taken their official oaths in private or in small ceremonies early in the new year. Stein, who succeeded term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, gave a brief speech at his Jan. 1 swearing- in. Saturday's address, being streamed by North Carolina public television, was expected to go longer.",
      "Stein, the attorney general for the past eight years who defeated then-Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in November, already has signaled the Hurricane Helene recovery as a top early-term priority. He has visited western North Carolina twice since Jan. 1 and issued a half-dozen executive orders on the state government's response to the historic flooding.",
      "Republican state legislative leaders sounded hopeful on the General Assembly's opening day this week that they could work with Stein to approve more hurricane recovery money early in 2025.",
      "On more partisan issues, Stein is in a better position compared to Cooper since 2023 to permanently block legislation that he vetoes. Republicans are now one House seat short of holding a veto-proof majority in the legislature, meaning Stein's vetoes can hold if House Democrats remain united.",
      "When Cooper became governor in 2017, approaching snow and sleet forced cancellations of a public swearing-in ceremony and inaugural parade. Four years later, after Cooper\u2019s reelection, COVID-19 restrictions derailed gatherings. A made-for-television inauguration ceremony for Cooper and other Council members was held outside the Executive Mansion."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans officials projected confidence in their security plans as the city prepares to host the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras in the aftermath of a terror attack that killed 14 people on New Year's Day and questions linger over security lapses.",
      "\u201cWe know that we're ready but guess what? We're wanting to double down on those efforts just to make sure,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said a Friday press conference.",
      "City officials say they have been working for more than two years to prepare for the Super Bowl and will have around 400 city police officers present along with other local, state and federal authorities.",
      "The 11th Super Bowl hosted by New Orleans on Feb. 9 is expected to draw an estimated 100,000 visitors to the city, according to Collin Arnold, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Mardi Gras on March 4. also brings thousands onto the streets.",
      "At Cantrell's request, Mardi Gras was recently upgraded to Homeland Security's highest security event rating, allowing for more federal resources. The New Orleans Police Department hired former New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton as a consultant this week and are in the process of bolstering security protocol.",
      "Multiple investigations are now reviewing how an Islamic State-group inspired attacker was able to drive his F-150 truck onto one the city's famed Bourbon Street and plow into New Year's reveler's. A lawsuit alleges the city and multiple contractors failed to instigate security measures that could have prevented or mitigated the attack.",
      "Cantrell said the city is in the process of assessing its security barriers and engaging in mechanical upgrades, including bringing in more steel Archer barriers to block vehicles from traveling down sidewalks. Bollards \u2014 protective steel columns \u2014 being installed on Bourbon Street for the Super Bowl are reportedly not strong enough to prevent a similar vehicle attack from occurring.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure the best is what we give towards the city of New Orleans, looking at all equipment,\" Cantrell said.",
      "NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick declined to provide specifics on the city's Super Bowl safety plan which she said the NFL's security team was \u201cconfident in.\"",
      "Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Monta\u00f1o indicated the city is pulling out all the stops: \u201cLet\u2019s prepare and use whatever means financially and we\u2019ll worry about that after the fact.\"",
      "Council President J.P. Morrell sought to reassure anxious visitors ahead of the Super Bowl and Mardis Gras that New Orleans will continue to offer \u201cthe greatest hospitality in America.\u201d",
      "\"We are still that place, you will still be welcomed, you will still enjoy everything New Orleans has to offer.\u201d",

      "President Joe Biden says he is still considering whether to give pardons to people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Friday said he was still considering whether to give pardons to people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said he and his aides were playing close attention to rhetoric from Trump and his allies about his political opponents and those involved in his various criminal and civil woes.",
      "\u201cIt depends on some of the language and expectations that Trump broadcast in the last couple days here as to what he\u2019s going to do,\" Biden said. \u201cThe idea that he would punish people for not adhering to what he thinks should be policy related to his well-being is just outrageous.\"",
      "Biden has just 10 days left in office, and the institutionalist has been using his waning days in office to restore some of the transition norms broken by his predecessor-turned-successor. But issuing preemptive pardons \u2014 for actual or imagined offenses by Trump\u2019s critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming administration \u2014 would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested ways.",
      "Trump's frequent targets include Republican Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman, and Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat. They helped lead the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. He has aimed particular criticism at special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "Biden, who Trump has said should be jailed, scoffed at the notion that he would pardon himself. \u201cWhat would I pardon myself for?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cNo, I have no contemplation of pardoning myself for anything. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d",
      "Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the Republican members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, rejected the prospect of a pardon from Biden earlier this week in an appearance on CNN.",
      "\u201cI understand the theory behind it because Donald Trump has clearly said he\u2019s going to go after everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the second you take a pardon and it looks like you\u2019re guilty of something \u2014 I\u2019m guilty of nothing besides bringing the truth to the American people and, in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "In his remarks to reporters, Biden said a decision by the social media giant Meta to end fact-checking on Facebook was \u201creally shameful,\u201d calling it \u201ccontrary to American justice.\u201d",
      "The move to replace third-party fact-checking with user-written \u201ccommunity notes,\u201d similar to those on Trump backer Elon Musk\u2019s social platform X, was the latest example of a media company moving to accommodate the incoming administration. It comes on the fourth anniversary of Zuckerberg's banning Trump from his platforms after the insurrection.",
      "Biden added: \u201cYou think it doesn\u2019t matter that they let it be printed? Where millions of people read it, things that are simply not true. I mean, I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s all about. It\u2019s just completely contrary to everything America\u2019s about. We want to tell the truth.\u201d"

      "A federal judge is set to hear arguments on whether to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for continuing to spread lies about two Georgia election workers after they secured a $148 million defamation judgment against him",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge is set to hear arguments Friday on whether to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for continuing to spread lies about two Georgia election workers after they secured a $148 million defamation judgment against him.",
      "Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have asked U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., to impose civil contempt sanctions against Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who served as Donald Trump's attorney. They say Giuliani has continued to falsely accuse Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, of committing election fraud in connection with the 2020 election.",
      "Moss and Freeman sued Giuliani, saying he upended their lives with racist threats and harassment. A jury sided with the mother and daughter, who are Black, in December 2023 and awarded them $75 million in punitive damages plus roughly $73 million in other damages.",
      "\"Mr. Giuliani started lying about Plaintiffs in December of 2020, and refused to stop after repeatedly being told that his election-rigging conspiracy theory about Plaintiffs was baseless, malicious, and dangerous,\" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote.",
      "Giuliani's attorneys argued that the plaintiffs haven't presented \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that he violated a court order in the defamation case in comments that he made on November podcasts about alleged ballot counting irregularities in Georgia.",
      "\u201cGiuliani acted with the good faith belief that his comments did not violate the (judgment) and he should not be subject to contempt sanctions,\u201d his lawyers wrote.",
      "If Howell holds Giuliani, a Republican, in contempt of court, she would be the second federal judge to do so this week. On Monday in New York, Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt of court for related claims that he failed to turn over evidence to help the judge decide whether he can keep a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium.",
      "Giuliani, who testified in Liman\u2019s Manhattan courtroom Jan. 3, said he didn't turn over everything because he believed the requests were overly broad, inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by plaintiffs' lawyers.",
      "Giuliani, 80, said in a court filing that he will attend Friday's hearing before Howell despite having travel-related concerns about his health and safety. He said he gets death threats and has been told to be careful about traveling.",
      "\"I had hoped the Court would understand and accommodate my needs. However, it appears I was mistaken,\" he said in the filing.",
      "On the witness stand, Moss and Freeman described fearing for their lives after becoming the target of a false conspiracy theory that Giuliani and other Republicans spread as they tried to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Moss told jurors she tried to change her appearance, seldom leaves her home and suffers from panic attacks.",
      "\u201cMoney will never solve all my problems,\u201d Freeman told reporters after the jury's verdict. \u201cI can never move back into the house that I call home. I will always have to be careful about where I go and who I choose to share my name with. I miss my home. I miss my neighbors, and I miss my name.\u201d",

      "Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area.",
      "In hilly, upscale Pacific Palisades, home to Hollywood stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Billy Crystal who lost houses in the fire, officials have placed the origin of the wind-whipped blaze behind a home on Piedra Morada Drive, which sits above a densely wooded arroyo.",
      "While lightning is the most common source of fires in the U.S., according to the National Fire Protection Association, investigators were able to rule that out quickly. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton fire, which started in east Los Angeles County and has also destroyed hundreds of homes.",
      "The next two most common causes: fires intentionally set, and those sparked by utility lines.",
      "John Lentini, owner of Scientific Fire Analysis in Florida, who has investigated large fires in California including the Oakland Hills fire in 1991, said the size and scope of the blaze doesn\u2019t change the approach to finding out what caused it.",
      "\u201cThis was once a small fire,\u201d Lentini said. \u201cPeople will focus on where the fire started, determine the origin and look around the origin and determine the cause.\u201d",
      "So far there has been no official indication of arson in either blaze, and utility lines have not yet been identified as a cause either.",
      "Utilities are required to report to the California Public Utilities Commission when they know of \u201celectric incidents potentially associated with a wildfire,\u201d Terrie Prosper, the commission's communications director, said via email. CPUC staff then investigate to see if there were violations of state law.",
      "The 2017 Thomas Fire, one of the largest fires in state history, was sparked by Southern California Edison power lines that came into contact during high wind, investigators determined. The blaze killed two people and charred more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers), according to the investigation headed by the Ventura County Fire Department.",
      "So far no such reports for the current fires have been posted to the CPUC website that tracks such filings.",
      "While lightning, arson and utility lines are the most common causes, debris burning and fireworks are also common causes.",
      "But fires are incited by myriad sources, including accidents.",
      "In 2021, a couple's gender reveal stunt started a large fire that torched close to 36 square miles (about 90 square kilometers) of terrain, destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings and claimed the life of a firefighter, Charlie Morton.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires were still burning with little to no containment on Thursday. Winds softened, but there was no rain in the forecast as the flames moved through miles of dry landscape.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to go out when it runs out of fuel, or when the weather stops,\u201d Lentini said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to put that thing out until it\u2019s ready to go out.\u201d"

      "He discussed everything from his desire to have the U.S. take control of Greenland to the parade of technology company leaders who have come to Florida to visit him since Election Day, to his threats to impose steep tariffs on Canada.",
      "The president-elect also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cwants to meet, and we're setting it up.\u201d",
      "The dinner came after Trump held a lengthy, closed-door meeting Wednesday with Republican Senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Trump described his discussions with his senators, as \u201ca love fest\u201d but added, \u201cThis is a love fest, too.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe governors aren\u2019t exactly chopped liver,\u201d he said to laughter.",
      "Trump also renewed previous vows to cooperate with leaders in blue states, too, saying, \"We want to get along with the Democrats. I\u2019m trying to be nice.\u201d",
      "Gianforte said that many of the governors present were concerned about \u201coverreach\u201d by the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal entities under President Joe Biden, adding, \u201cI know each governor that's standing up here has expressed frustration.\u201d",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 Trump\u2019s GOP presidential primary rival in last year\u2019s primary \u2014 was asked about the president-elect sharply criticizing Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom as cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles.",
      "DeSantis blamed the media for what he said was unnecessarily promoting controversy and political division, adding that Trump will collaborate effectively with states regardless of whether they are red or blue.",
      "\u201cI worked well with Biden, during his time, with natural disasters, and I worked well with Donald Trump,\u201d DeSantis said, referring to hurricanes that have hit Florida as well as the deadly collapse of a beachfront condo in Surfside in 2021. \u201cSo, I\u2019m very confident, as a state that knows \u2014 we face these \u2014 that a Trump administration is going to be very strong and going to be there for the people regardless of party.\u201d",
      "One of the questions Trump answered Thursday was about the frequent drone sightings that made headlines in recent weeks, but have seen attention wane more recently. That prompted several of the governors around the table to express concern that such aircraft could make incursions into military or other secure areas.",
      "\u201cThey don't want to talk about it,\u201d Trump said, repeating an assertion he's made in the past that the government may be covering something up on the issue. He promised to shed more light on it after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cWe're gonna find out on the 21st,\u201d he said. \"You have to give me a little time after the Inauguration. But, shortly thereafter, I will give you a report on it. We'll tell you exactly what it is.\u201d",

      "New Mexico's top prosecutor is suing Western New Mexico University's regents and outgoing president",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico\u2019s top prosecutor is suing Western New Mexico University's regents and outgoing president to try to undo a lucrative severance package that included a nearly $2 million payout approved in the wake of a scathing report that detailed wasteful spending and lax financial oversight at the school.",
      "State Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez outlined a number of allegations that included breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the state's open meetings law and state constitution. He also raised questions about who at the university rushed to issue a check to Shepard, noting that some regents already had resigned amid pressure from the governor.",
      "The attorney general's office initially filed an emergency motion in state district court seeking to delay any payouts to Shepard, not knowing that a check already had been issued on Jan. 2.",
      "The state is now seeking to prohibit Shepherd from spending the money and asking the court to establish a trust where it could be deposited until the legal dispute is resolved.",
      "Despite requests for documentation from the university, Torrez said his office has not received any records that would show who initiated the negotiations around Shepard's departure. He suggested the process has been tainted by greed and arrogance and that students will pay the price.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely disgraceful that the people who have been entrusted with making sure that they get the education they need to build a better future have instead used that opportunity to enrich themselves, to go on lavish taxpayer funded trips, and then when they are held to account, to hand out a golden parachute to one of their pals,\" Torrez said. That will not stand.\u201d",
      "Shepard's legal team disputed the attorney general's claims, saying regents are responsible for negotiating and approving executive compensation and severance agreements and that notices appeared in the local newspaper that the board would be discussing the president's contract during a Dec. 20 meeting.",
      "John Anderson, an attorney for Shepard, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the board had appointed a subcommittee to negotiate the separation agreement before unanimously approving it.",
      "\u201cThis entire process was handled appropriately, legally and transparently,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cDr. Shepard did not expedite his payment. Any allegations to the contrary have no legal or factual basis.\u201d",
      "According to court documents, the university agreed to pay Shepard more than three times the amount required if it had terminated his employment without cause. The agreement also guarantees Shepard a spot as a tenured faculty member, earning at least $200,000 annually for five years. He can serve remotely and was given an eight-month sabbatical with full pay.",
      "The leadership shakeup follows an investigation by the state auditor's office that found more than $363,000 in wasteful spending and improper use of public funds.",
      "State lawmakers started raising questions in 2023 about Shepard's spending on international trips and on high-end furniture and about his wife, Valerie Plame\u2019s, use of a university purchasing card. At the time, Shepard said regents vetted his spending requests and that he was familiar with policies governing the use of public money.",
      "The events could prompt lawmakers to consider new legislation during the session that begins this month.",
      "House Speaker Javier Martinez on Thursday said he would support changes to ensure public institutions are managed in the best interests of students and taxpayers, rather than for personal enrichment of university officials.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this is about safeguarding the money of the people of the state of New Mexico, and this is about ensuring that no one is above the law,\u201d he said."

      "In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, Georgia. We wanted to see them.",
      "Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. Together, we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage, an unassuming red brick ranch home. They flexed their modesty more than any trappings of power.",
      "We walked into the living room where Jimmy greeted us like family. That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost six decades, a deep friendship that started in 1974.",
      "I was a 31-year-old senator. And I was the first senator outside of Georgia, maybe the first senator, to endorse his candidacy for president.",
      "It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter\u2019s enduring attribute: Character. Character. Character.",
      "Because of that, character, I believe, is destiny. Destiny in our lives and quite frankly, destiny in the life of the nation.",
      "It is an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life in a decent country. A life of purpose, a life of meaning. Now, how do we find that good life? What does it look like? What does it take to build character? Do the ends justify the means?",
      "Jimmy Carter\u2019s friendship taught me, and through his life taught me, that strength of character is more than title or the power we hold. It\u2019s the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect. That everyone, and I mean everyone, deserves an even shot. Not a guarantee, but just a shot.",
      "You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor. And to stand up to what my dad used to say is the greatest sin of all: the abuse of power.",
      "Now, it\u2019s not about being perfect, because none of us are perfect. We\u2019re all fallible. But it\u2019s about asking ourselves: Are we striving to do things, the right things? What values? What are the values that animate our spirit? To operate from fear or hope, ego or generosity? Do we show grace? Do we keep the faith when it\u2019s most tested?",
      "For keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is the story, in my view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter\u2019s life.",

      "The story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his savior and the ideals of this nation. The story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to serve and shape the world.",
      "The man had character.",
      "Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God. And that his candidacy spoke and wrote about faith as a substance of things hoped for, and evidence of the things not seen. Faith founded on commandments of scripture. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul. And love thy neighbor as thyself.",
      "Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do. In his life, in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. It can be lonely. But it requires action to be the doers of the world.",
      "But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the gospel, found in many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. Because the very journey of our nation is a walk of sheer faith. To do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. A nation where all are created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.",
      "We\u2019ve never fully lived up to that idea of America. We\u2019ve never walked away from it either, because of patriots like Jimmy Carter. Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and a good and faithful servant of God and of the people.",
      "And today, many think he was from a bygone era. But in reality, he saw well into the future.",
      "A white Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. A hard-working farmer who championed conservation and clean energy.",
      "And a president who redefined the relationship with a vice president.",
      "Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. Together they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust, because both were men of character.",
      "And as we all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post-presidency by making a powerful difference as a private citizen in America. And I might add, as you all know around the world, through it all he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flow to others.",
      "At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves: joy, solidarity, love, commitment. Not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we\u2019ve all been granted. To make every minute of our time here on Earth count.",
      "That\u2019s the definition of a good life, a life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years.",
      "To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter\u2019s example.",
      "I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again. To the entire Carter family, thank you, and I mean this sincerely, for sharing them both with America and the world. We love you all.",
      "Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. We saw Jimmy as he always was, at peace with a life fully lived. A good life of purpose and meaning, of character driven by destiny and filled with the power of faith, hope and love.",
      "Say it again: Faith, hope and love.",
      "As he returns to Plains, Georgia, for his final resting place, we can say goodbye. In the words of the prophet Micah, who Jimmy so admired until his final breath, Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly.",
      "May God bless a great American, a dear friend and a good man. May he rise up, be raised up on eagle\u2019s wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.",
      "God bless you, Jimmy Carter."

      "WASHINGTON -- As cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles, President-elect Donald Trump hasn't been offering much sympathy. Instead, he's claiming he could do a better job managing the crisis, spewing falsehoods and casting blame on the state's Democratic governor.",
      "Trump has lashed out at his longtime political foe Gov. Gavin Newsom's forest management policies and falsely claimed the state's fish conservation efforts are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. Referring to the governor by a derisive nickname, Trump said he should resign.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 180,000 people have been under evacuation orders and the fires have consumed more than 45 square miles (116 square kilometers). One that destroyed the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades became the most destructive blaze in Los Angeles history.",
      "Trump v. Newsom: Round 2 was to be expected \u2014 the liberal Democrat has long been one of Trump\u2019s biggest foils. But the Western fires are also a sign of something far more grave than a political spat or a fight over fish. Wildfire season is growing ever longer thanks to increasing drought and heat brought on by climate change.",
      "Trump refuses to recognize the environmental dangers, instead blaming increasing natural disasters on his political opponents or on acts of God. He has promised to drill for more oil and cut back on renewable energy.",
      "On Thursday, Trump said on social media that Newsom should \u201copen up the water main\u201d \u2014 an overly simplistic solution to a complex problem. \u201cNO MORE EXCUSES FROM THIS INCOMPETENT GOVERNOR,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cIT\u2019S ALREADY FAR TOO LATE!\u201d",
      "Standing on the street in a scorched subdivision as a home behind him was engulfed in flames, Newsom responded to the criticism when asked about it by CNN.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally fleeing. People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools. Families completely torn asunder. Churches burned down, and this guy wants to politicize it,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI have a lot of thoughts and I know what I want to say, but I won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In a post on his Truth Social media network, Trump tried to connect dry hydrants to criticism of the state\u2019s approach to balancing the distribution of water to farms and cities with the need to protect endangered species including the Delta smelt. Trump has sided with farmers over environmentalists in a long-running dispute over California\u2019s scarce water resources. But that debate has nothing to do with the hydrant issue in Los Angeles, driven by an intense demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes.",
      "About 40% of Los Angeles city water comes from state-controlled projects connected to northern California and the state has limited the water it delivers this year. But the southern California reservoirs these canals help feed are at above-average levels for this time of year.",
      "Roughly 20% of hydrants across the city went dry as crews battled blazes, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. Firefighters in Southern California are accustomed to dealing with the strong Santa Ana winds that blow in the fall and winter, but the hurricane-force gusts earlier in the week took them by surprise. The winds grounded firefighting aircraft that should have been making critical water drops, straining the hydrant system.",
      "\u201cThis is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my 25 years on the fire department,\u201d Los Angeles Fire Capt. Adam VanGerpen told CBS This Morning.",
      "Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said the ferocity of the fire made the demand for water four times greater than \u201cwe\u2019ve ever seen in the system.\u201d",
      "Hydrants are designed for fighting fires at one or two houses at a time, not hundreds, Qui\u00f1ones said, and refilling the tanks also requires asking fire departments to pause firefighting efforts.",
      "President Joe Biden, who was in California for an environmental event that ended up being canceled as the fires raged, appeared with Newsom at a Santa Monica firehouse on Wednesday and quickly issued a major disaster declaration for California, releasing some immediate federal funds.",
      "But any additional federal response will be overseen by Trump, who has a history of withholding or delaying federal aid to punish his political enemies.",
      "In September, during a press conference at his Los Angeles golf course, Trump threatened: \"We won\u2019t give him money to put out all his fires. And if we don\u2019t give him the money to put out his fires, he\u2019s got problems.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s support in California has increased in recent years, which could further embolden him in his tussles with Democratic leaders there. In 2024, he improved on his vote share in Los Angeles and surrounding areas hit by the fires by 4.68 percentage points. And while he still lost the state overall, he grew his overall margin by 4 points compared to the 2020 election.",
      "As for the impact of the fires on Californians, Trump said areas in Beverly Hills and around it were \u201cbeing decimated\u201d and that he had \"many friends living in those houses.\u201d He framed the losses as a potential hit to the state's finances.",
      "\u201cThe biggest homes, some of the most valuable homes in the world are just destroyed. I don\u2019t even know. You talk about a tax base, if those people leave you\u2019re going to lose half your tax base of California,\u201d Trump said.",

      "A Florida man has pleaded guilty in connection with the carjacking and kidnapping of a Connecticut couple, in what authorities call a failed ransom plot that may have been linked to a $240 million cryptocurrency heist",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A Florida man pleaded guilty Thursday in connection with the carjacking and kidnapping of a Connecticut couple, in what authorities called a failed ransom plot that may have been linked to a $240 million cryptocurrency heist.",
      "Michael Rivas, 19, of Miami, was one of six men arrested after a series of events in Danbury on Aug. 25. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping and conspiracy charges in federal court in Hartford. Two others are expected to enter similar pleas in the same court on Friday.",
      "The couple were driving in a new Lamborghini SUV when the suspects forced them out of the SUV, assaulted them, put them in a van and bound them, police said. Witnesses immediately alerted police. Four of the men were arrested after abandoning their vehicles including the van and fleeing on foot, while the other two were later taken into custody at a nearby home the group had rented through Airbnb, authorities said. The couple were injured but survived the ordeal.",
      "Rivas, dressed in a tan prison uniform with his legs shackled during the hearing, apologized for his actions. He said it was a \u201cdumb\u201d decision to help one of his co-defendants carry out what he called a \u201cvendetta.\u201d He did not elaborate.",
      "His lawyer, Brian Woolf, said Rivas accepted a co-defendant\u2019s invitation to take part in the plot with the hope of getting a share of the ransom money, and he regrets that decision.",
      "The plot was hatched because the suspects \u201cbelieved the victims\u2019 son had access to significant amounts of digital currency,\u201d and they planned to demand a ransom from the son to be paid in digital currency,\u201d according to a federal indictment.",
      "Just a week earlier, at least two thieves had stolen $240 million worth of Bitcoin in an elaborate scam over the internet and by phone, and then went on an indulgent spending spree on cars, mansions, travel, jewelry and nights out at clubs, authorities said.",
      "Publicly, federal prosecutors and agents have not definitively linked the kidnapping to the Bitcoin theft. Officials have declined to comment on possible connections between the two cases including how the six suspects knew the couple's son had a large amount of digital currency.",
      "But federal agents told Danbury police that the FBI was looking into whether the couple's son was involved in the Bitcoin theft, Danbury Detective Sgt. Steven Castrovinci told The Associated Press. Neither Danbury police nor federal authorities have named the couple or their son.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Ross Weingarten declined to comment after Thursday's court hearing.",
      "In mid-September, federal prosecutors announced that the two men, Malone Lam, 20, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, had been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in connection with the cryptocurrency theft.",
      "Court documents say unnamed coconspirators were in on the scam with the two men. Their lawyers have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said in court documents that Lam, Serrano and the unnamed coconspirators posed as technical support staff for Google and a cryptocurrency exchange while contacting the victim of the theft with an offer to help him with a supposed security breach.",
      "The victim, from Washington, D.C., believed them and gave them remote access to his computer on Aug. 18. That resulted in the alleged thieves making off with more than 4,100 Bitcoin, then valued at more than $240 million, prosecutors said. That amount of Bitcoin is now worth nearly $380 million.",
      "According to prosecutors, Serrano, of Los Angeles, admitted during an interview with federal investigators that he used the stolen currency to buy three automobiles, worth more than $1 million in total, as well as a $500,000 watch. He also said he had about $20 million of the victim\u2019s currency and agreed to transfer the funds to the FBI, authorities said.",
      "Meanwhile Lam, a citizen of Singapore who had addresses in Los Angeles and Miami, Florida, was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a night at Los Angeles night clubs and acquiring custom Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches, prosecutors said. He also was renting two Miami mansions, bought a $2 million watch and had a Lamborghini Revuelto worth more than $1 million.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in court documents that at least $100 million of the stolen funds remained missing.",
      "Exactly a week after the crypto theft, the couple from Danbury, a city of more than 80,000 people along the New York border, were forced out of their SUV in their hometown after one of the carjackers\u2019 vehicles rear-ended them and two other vehicles surrounded them. The group assaulted the man with a baseball bat and dragged the woman by her hair as they put them in the van, where the couple were bound with duct tape, police said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply remorseful for my irresponsible behavior,\u201d Rivas told U.S. District Judge Sarala Nagala on Thursday. \u201cI should have known better.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not what my parents taught me growing up,\u201d he added.",
      "Rivas and the other five men also are facing kidnapping and assault charges in Connecticut state court. The other men are also from Florida.",
      "Sentencing was set for May 13. The prosecution and defense agreed on sentencing guidelines that call for about 11 to 14 years in prison."

      "Six people who were injured and the father of a man who was killed in the New Year's truck attack filed a lawsuit Thursday against the City of New Orleans and two contractors, claiming they failed to protect revelers from an Army veteran who sped around a police blockade and raced down Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring at least 30.",
      "The attack by Shamsud-Din Jabbar was tragic but preventable, leaving the six victims with broken bones, physical suffering and mental anguish and killing Brandon Taylor, according to the lawsuit filed in Orleans Parish Civil District Court by Matthew Hemmer with the Morris Bart Law Firm. Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police.",
      "The plaintiffs, who are seeking unspecified damages, include Alexis Windham, who suffered impact and gunshot injuries to her foot, and Corian Evans, Jalen Lilly, Justin Brown, Shara Frison and Gregory Townsend, who suffered broken bones and other injuries. They were joined by Brandon Taylor's father, Joseph. Windham, Evans, Lilly and Brown are from Alabama while Frison and Townsend are from Missouri.",
      "Taylor, 43, worked as a restaurant cook in the New Orleans area and loved music, especially rap. He leaves behind his fiancee, who was with him when he was killed, and his father.",
      "Email and phone messages left with the City of New Orleans, Mayor LaToya Cantrell, and contractors Mott MacDonald and Hard Rock Construction seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately returned.",
      "Incidents of vehicles driving into crowds started increasing after 2016, when 86 people were killed on Bastille Day in Nice, France, the lawsuit said. New Orleans sought advice on the risk of this type of attack in the French Quarter and invested $40 million in public safety improvement projects, including acquiring portable bollards \u2014 protective columns designed to block vehicle traffic \u2014to keep cars off Bourbon Street.",
      "However, the bollards were often disabled when the tracks they move on got clogged with beads, drink containers, rainwater and other fluids, the lawsuit said. A 2019 report by New York firm Interfor International said the French Quarter was at risk for a vehicular attack, adding \u201cthe current bollard system on Bourbon Street does not appear to work\" and should be fixed immediately.",
      "An April 2024 report by Mott MacDonald, a design firm hired for roadway projects, included the possibility of a Ford F-150 truck turning on to Bourbon Street, which is what happened on New Year's Day, but the company's bollard replacement project did not include fixed bollards in the French Quarter, the lawsuit said.",
      "Construction on the safety updates began in November, but work on Canal Street didn't begin until Dec. 19 and construction was ongoing on Jan. 1, when the attack occurred, the suit said. Authorities have said Jabbar drove an F-150 pickup truck onto a sidewalk around a police car blockading the Canal Street entrance to Bourbon Street.",
      "\u201cAppropriate barriers, temporary or otherwise, were not erected in the construction site,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cAs a result, the intersection had the appearance of a soft target. Upon initial penetration, Mr. Jabbar was able to travel approximately three blocks down Bourbon Street.\u201d",
      "The contractors and the city failed to implement an effective system for deterring such a threat, the suit said.",

    "story": [
      "Tennessee's Department of Correction has released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual after initially refusing to do so",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee on Thursday released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual, blacking out sporadic titles and team names throughout the notably trimmed-down document that now provides vague guidelines and omits previously detailed steps on carrying out the death penalty.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction initially refused to hand over the manual when pressed by The Associated Press, arguing that the state had to keep the entire manual secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved.",
      "However, on Thursday, the agency abruptly reversed course and provided the AP with a copy of the lethal injection protocol. Their only explanation for the change was that the state was revising its decision.",
      "The 44-page manual is noticeably shorter than the 2018 version the state had been operating under, which contained nearly 100 pages, including 11 pages detailing how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. The state's failure to follow those procedures forced Republican Gov. Bill Lee in 2022 to call a last-minute halt to the execution of inmate Oscar Smith and then place a moratorium on new executions while the process was under review.",
      "An independent report later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested as required by the manual. Later, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection drugs \u201cincorrectly testified\u201d under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required.",
      "The new manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes a requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Yet the new protocol does include several new additions, including now authorizing the state to deviate from the protocol whenever the Correction Department commissioner deems it necessary.",
      "In Tennessee, the 2018 lethal injection protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence. The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. One other change \u2014 the people most responsible for carrying out the execution will now be outside contractors. The manual requires an IV team of at least two people and a physician who are not Tennessee Department of Correction personnel.",
      "When ordering the pause in 2022, Lee stressed that it was his administration's duty to \u201censure continued transparency\u201d for Tennesseans surrounding the death penalty and that he expected \"the Tennessee Department of Correction to leave no question that procedures are correctly followed.\u201d",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender\u2019s habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee\u2019s death row inmates, told the AP in an email that the new manual \u201cfails to address the many concerns raised by the independent investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs of today, we still do not know the source of drugs, whether they are compounded, or whether they have been diverted from the market into a gray market, how they will be procured, stored, tested, and administered,\" she said. \"This level of secrecy is inconsistent with the promises of transparency made by the Governor two years ago.\u201d",
      "Across the U.S., executions have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections.",
      "Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams. Meanwhile, some courts have dismissed states' claim that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials over a lack of evidence."

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday said she will push for new laws to make it harder for hedge funds to purchase large numbers of single-family homes in the state.",
      "In a statement, Hochul said she would propose legislation this year that would require a 75 day waiting period before large investment firms could place bids on new homes hitting the market and limit certain tax benefits when the firms purchase homes.",
      "The plan comes as lawmakers elsewhere have also sought to address public concerns that hedge funds or other big investors are buying up single-family homes and shrinking the housing supply for individual buyers and families. Experts have blamed housing scarcity on several factors, including high mortgage rates and years of underbuilding of new homes.",
      "Hochul, in her statement, said \u201cshadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options.\u201d",
      "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "A report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies found that non-individual investors \u2014 which includes landlords who form limited liability corporations \u2014 owned a quarter of single-family rentals in 2021. Larger investors tended to buy newer and bigger homes in places with population growth and rapid rent increases, according to the report.",
      "A different report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the country's five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of all single-family rental homes nationally in 2022, which amounted to about 300,000 homes.",
      "Hochul, a Democrat, has rolled out a series of economic proposals for the state's legislative session that are geared toward addressing the state's high cost of living. On Thursday, she also announced proposals to incentivize the construction of starter homes and help first-time homeowners with down payments.",

      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",

      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",

      "For years, there have been rumblings of concern about a potential downturn in the world's largest economy.",
      "It has consistently proved the doubters wrong and last month was no exception.",
      "The job gains in December were much higher than the roughly 160,000 analysts had expected: Employers added 256,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% in November to 4.1%, the Labor Department said.",
      "Overall, 2.2 million jobs were added last year - an average of 186,000 a month.",
      "That marked a slowdown from a year earlier, but is still a pretty healthy figure.",
      "Average hourly pay was up 3.9% last month compared with December 2023. It's a solid gain but not one so strong as to worry analysts that fast wage growth will prompt price increases to suddenly accelerate.",
      "Nathaniel Casey, investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, called it \"the goldilocks of labour market releases\".",
      "2. There could be fewer interest rate cuts",
      "The US central bank, which is charged with keeping both prices and employment stable, cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years in September, saying it wanted to head off signs of weakness in the jobs market.",
      "It boosted hopes of many would-be borrowers in the US, who have been facing the highest borrowing costs in roughly two decades and were eager to see them come down.",
      "But the strength of this month's data suggests fears about the jobs market may have been premature, removing pressure on the bank to act.",
      "Interest rates on 10 and 30-year government debt in the US jumped after the report, with the latter topping 5%.",
      "Investors had already been paring back bets on cuts this year, worried by signs that the bank's progress on stabilising prices was stalling.",
      "There are also risks policies called for by President-elect Donald Trump, such as sweeping border taxes and migrant deportations, could raise prices or wages, putting pressure on inflation.",
      "Even if inflation data due next week shows inflation - the rate of price increases -cooling, Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said this jobs data means she doesn't expect the Fed \"to cut rates any time soon.\"",
      "3. Higher US borrowing costs mean higher global rates too",
      "The interest rates set by the US central bank have a powerful influence over borrowing costs for many loans - and not only in America.",
      "Borrowing costs globally have increased in recent months, responding to expectations that US interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer.",
      "In the UK, for example, the interest rate, or yield, on 30-year government debt hit the highest level in more than 25 years earlier this week, putting pressure on the government as it tries to work out its spending and borrowing plans.",
      "While the latest US jobs figures might be good news for the US economy and its dollar, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, warned they would be \"punishing news for global bond markets, particularly UK gilts\", referring to the name of government bonds, or debt.",
      "\"The peak for yields has not yet been reached, suggesting additional stresses that several markets, especially the UK, can ill afford,\" she said."

      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",

      "The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a law that bans TikTok in the US over national security concerns unless its China-based parent company sells the platform ahead of a 19 January deadline.",
      "The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a  violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US.",
      "The US government argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "A decision by the top court has to be made within days. President-elect Donald Trump - who returns to the White House in just over a week - now argues against the ban.",
      "The law requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell it in the US or cease operations on 19 January. The company has said it will not sell the short-form video platform.",
      "Congress passed the law with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties - a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people.",
      "The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.",
      "TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
      "Noel Francisco, a former US solicitor general appearing for the platform, stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship.",
      "He argued that  \"the government cannot restrict speech in order to protect us from speech\".",
      "\"That's precisely what this law does from beginning to end.\"",
      "A representative for platform creators argued they should be free to use the publisher of their choice.",

      "But he said that under the First Amendment, mere ideas do not represent a national security threat.",
      "Justice department lawyer Elizabeth B Prelogar told  the court that ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government made it a national security risk.",
      "She told the court that Beijing \"could weaponise TikTok at any time to harm the United States\".",

      "Ms Prelogar, arguing for the US justice department, said \"nothing permanent\" had to happen on that day and there was still time for a sale.",
      "Forcing the app to go dark could be just the \"jolt\" ByteDance needs to seriously consider a sale, she said.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,\" she said, comparing the situation to \"game of chicken\" and one in which the US should not \"blink first\".",
      "After the hearing, legal observers predicted that the Supreme Court's justices appeared to be swayed by the government's concerns.",
      "\"Traditionally the Supreme Court has been willing to defer somewhat when national security is at stake,\" said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
      "\"I expect that the justices by a majority will side with the government,\" he added.",
      "Jacob Hubert, a lawyer and the president of the Liberty Justice Center - which represents BASED Politics, an internet content creator - said it was still difficult to predict how the court would rule.",
      "But he says  the ban would violate the freedom of speech of millions of Americans - a point he believes was effectively made by TikTok's lawyers.",
      "\"It's not about China's rights, or the Communist Party's rights,\" he said. \"It is about the rights of Americans who use TikTok to, largely, speak with other Americans.\"",
      "More than a hundred people braved freezing conditions in Washington DC to attend the hearing in person.",

      "Rolls-Royce sold 5,712 cars in 2024, down from its record of 6,032 in 2023, but the total value of its sales was higher due to it selling more bespoke builds.",

      "The brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.",
      "As a luxury carmaker focused on export markets, Rolls-Royce is insulated from many of the challenges currently facing the wider European motor industry. However, it has been affected by a fall in demand in China, one of its most important markets.",

      "Rolls-Royce said the extension of its factory would \"create additional space\" for building bespoke cars.",

    "summary": "The body's co-chair says moving to community notes could have a big impact on gender rights and minority groups.",
    "story": [
      "The co-chair of the independent body that reviews Facebook and Instagram has said she is \"very concerned\" about sweeping changes to what content is allowed on the platforms and how its moderated.",
      "Helle Thorning-Schmidt, from Meta's oversight board, told the BBC she welcomed aspects of the shake-up, which will see users decide about the accuracy of posts via X-style \"community notes\".",
      "However, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said there were \"huge problems\" with what had been announced, including the potential impact on the LGBTQ+ community, as well as gender and trans rights.",
      "\"We are seeing many instances where hate speech can lead to real-life harm, so we will be watching that space very carefully,\" she added.",
      "In a video posted alongside a blog post by the company on Tuesday, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the decision was motivated by \"getting back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "He said third-party fact-checkers currently used by the firm were \"too politically biased\", meaning too many users were being \"censored\".",
      "However, the journalist Maria Ressa - who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 - said the suggestion the change would promote free speech was \"completely wrong\", telling the AFP news agency the decision meant there were \"extremely dangerous times ahead\" for social media users and democracy.",
      "\"Only if you're profit driven can you claim that; only if you want power and money can you claim that\", said Ms Ressa, who co-founded the Rappler news site in the Philippines.",

      "It is funded by Meta and was created by then president of global affairs, Sir Nick Clegg, who announced he was leaving the company less than a week ago.",
      "Ms Thorning-Schmidt - a former prime minister of Denmark - insisted it was needed more than ever.",
      "\"That's why it is good we have an oversight board that can discuss this in a transparent way with Meta\", she said.",
      "Some have suggested Sir Nick's departure - and the fact checking changes - are an attempt to get closer to the incoming Trump administration, and catch up with the access and influence enjoyed by another tech titan, Elon Musk.",
      "The tech journalist and author Kara Swisher told the BBC it was \"the most cynical move\" she had seen Mr Zuckerberg make in the \"many years\" she had been reporting on him.",
      "\"Facebook does whatever is in its self-interest\", she said.",
      "\"He wants to kiss up to Donald Trump, and catch up with Elon Musk in that act.\"",
      "While campaigners against hate speech online reacted with dismay to the change, some advocates of free speech have welcomed the news.",
      "The US free speech group Fire said: \"Meta's announcement shows the marketplace of ideas in action. Its users want a social media platform that doesn't suppress political content or use top-down fact-checkers.",
      "\"These changes will hopefully result in less arbitrary moderation decisions and freer speech on Meta's platforms.\"",
      "Speaking after the changes were announced, Trump told a news conference he was impressed by Mr Zuckerberg's decision and that Meta had \"come a long way\".",
      "Asked whether Mr Zuckerberg was \"directly responding\" to threats Trump had made to him in the past, the incoming US president responded: \"Probably.\"",
      "Advertiser exodus",

      "\"It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down,\" he said in his video message.",

      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, said that was a risk for Meta too.",
      "\"Meta's massive size and powerhouse ad platform insulate it somewhat from an X-like user and advertiser exodus,\" she told the BBC.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chancellor may face the prospect of breaking her own Budget rules",
    "story": [
      "Economists have warned that the government is \"on course\" to miss its own Budget borrowing targets after interest rates for UK long-term borrowing rose to their highest levels this century.",
      "The official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will start the process of updating its forecast next month to be presented to parliament in late March.",
      "The rising cost of borrowing means \"there is a significant chance that the OBR will judge that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on course to miss her main fiscal rule\", according to Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics.",
      "The yield on the 30-year gilt reached 5.35% on Wednesday, surpassing a previous high in August 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on a 10 year bond surged on Wednesday to its highest since October 2008, to reach 4.784%.",
      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",
      "The clear indication from the government is that although they will not hold another Budget in March, any necessary adjustment would have to come in terms of some new spending cuts.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a \u00a32bn auction of 30 year UK government debt sold at an effective interest rate of 5.18%.",
      "The Debt Management Office, a part of Treasury, effectively paid the highest interest rates for these very long term loans that have been since 1998.",
      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",
      "The rise in rates has affected the US and the UK more, and less so continental Europe. The tick-up in UK market rates after the Budget, initially faded by early December. But now British borrowing rates are moving up alongside US ones.",
      "Stagnant growth and sticky inflation have raised concerns about so-called \"stagflation\". Markets are starting to question the inflationary impacts of incoming President Donald Trump's trade and tax policies.",
      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation. And those questions are now occurring against the backdrop of the Trump trade tumult affecting global markets for borrowing. It's a bumpy start to 2025."

      "Three of the posters showed Mr Menk holding an open briefcase filled with US dollar and euro banknotes on fire, with two of them stating \"Withdraw from Exploitation\" and \"Withdraw from Riba\".",
      "Wahed said the burning of banknotes within the adverts was designed to show money \"going up in flames\" when inflation grew faster than the rate of savings.",

      "The ASA said the adverts would have been seen by many people, including people from the United States and eurozone countries, who \"would have viewed their nation's currency as being culturally significant\".",

      "\"While our intention was to spark thought and awareness, we recognise the importance of ensuring that messaging resonates positively with the diverse audiences that may consume them.",
      "\"We acknowledge and appreciate the ASA's feedback on the use of international currency.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",

      "Not even AI can predict the future (yet), nevertheless two of our tech editors have taken a look ahead to what they think will be big in 2025.",
      "Crypto's friend in the White House?",
      "As 2022 drew to a close the outlook was bleak for the cryptocurrency business.",

      "In March of 2024, the company's co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried received a 25-year jail sentence for defrauding customers and investors.",
      "The scandal rattled confidence in the whole sector.",
      "It seemed that cryptocurrencies would remain a niche product, with an enthusiastic but relatively limited following.",
      "What is cryptocurrency?",
      "What is cryptocurrency?",
      "But just a few months later and the industry was fizzing with optimism again. Behind the enthusiasm -  the success of Donald Trump in the 5 November presidential election.",
      "The feeling was that he would be more favourable to the cryptocurrency sector and, so far, that seems to be the case.",
      "In early December, Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to take up the top chairman role at the Wall Street regulator.",
      "Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than outgoing head, Gary Gensler.",
      "That announcement helped the value of one bitcoin, the biggest of the numerous cryptocurrencies, surge through $100,000.",
      "\"With Trump winning you can imagine in 2025 you'll get proactive regulation. You'll get removal of some negative regulation, which will then allow banks and other institutions into the space,\" says Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.",
      "In particular, Mr Kendrick points to a piece of guidance issued by the SEC called SAB 121. Since taking effect in 2022 it has made it difficult for banks and other financial firms to provide cryptocurrency services.",
      "Such a move might help Trump to fulfil his promise made in July to make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world.",
      "If he makes good on that pledge it would be a remarkable turnaround from 2021 when Trump described Bitcoin as a \"scam\".",
      "AI gets personal",
      "As AI tools move into our phones \u2013 Apple, Google and Samsung have all launched services that can edit photos, translate languages and carry out web searches \u2013 we are at the start of an era in which AI becomes an intrinsic part of our digital lives and increasingly helpful on a personal level.",
      "That\u2019s if we allow it, because it does require a bit of a leap of faith.",
      "Let\u2019s take diary management as an example. An AI tool efficiently can manage your diary for you, if you allow it to access it. But how far should this go?",
      "In order to be truly useful, does that mean it also needs to know who you would rather avoid meeting, or relationships  you want to keep secret, and from whom?",
      "Do you want it to provide you with summaries of counselling sessions, or medical  appointments?",
      "It\u2019s deeply personal information, and potentially both hugely embarrassing and extremely valuable if some glitch meant it was shared. Do you trust the big tech firms with that kind of data?",
      "Microsoft is pushing hard at this particular door. It got into trouble in 2024 for demoing a tool called Recall, which took snapshots of laptop desktops every few seconds, in order to help users locate content they\u2019d seen but couldn\u2019t remember where.",

      "Despite the challenges, Ben Wood, chief analyst at technology research company CCS Insight, expects that more personalised AI services will emerge in 2025.",
      "\"The output will be continuously updated by drawing on evolving data sources, such as emails, messages, documents and social media interactions.",
      "\u201cThis will allow the AI service to be tuned specifically to a person's communication style, needs and preferences,\" he says.",
      "But Mr Wood accepts that letting AI loose on your personal information will be a big step.",
      "\"Trust will be essential,\" says Mr Wood.",
      "Data on the move",
      "The more money pours into AI, then the more datacentres will need building.",
      "Training and running AI requires a lot of computing power, and works best with the latest computer chips and servers.",
      "Over the next five years as much as $1tn could be invested in datacentres by the biggest data users, including Google, Microsoft and Meta, according to CCS Insight.",
      "In Europe alone, between 2024 and 2028, data centre capacity is expected to grow by an average of 9% annually, according to property services company Savills.",
      "But those new facilities are unlikely to be built in the current datacentre hubs like London, Frankfurt, and Amsterdam.",
      "High property prices in those cities - Savills says that in London land prices can be as much as \u00a317m per acre - plus tight electricity supply means developers will be looking elsewhere.",
      "In the UK cities like Cambridge, Manchester and Birmingham could well be home to the next wave of datacentre construction.",
      "Elsewhere, Prague, Genoa, Munich, Dusseldorf and Milan are likely to be considered in Europe.",
      "At the heart of some of those new datacentres will be the latest computer chip from Nvidia, the company that dominates the market for chips used for AI.",
      "Unveiled in March 2024, the Blackwell chip is expected to start shipping in significant number in 2025.",
      "The new chip should allow tech firms to train AI four times faster and see AI operate 30 times faster than current computer chips, according to Vivek Arya, senior semiconductors analyst, at Bank of America Securities.",
      "Nvidia's biggest customers, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Coreweave are likely to get the tech first, according to reports.",
      "But other customers might struggle to get their hands on the super chip, with \"supply constrained in 2025\", according to Mr Arya.",

      "The government, which described the calculations as \"extremely complex\" and requiring a specialised role to complete, said it aims to clear most of the current backlog by the end of February.",
      "A Freedom of Information request - submitted by a member of a teachers' pensions Cash Equivalent Transfer Valuation (CETV) support group and seen by the BBC - suggests just under 2,000 teachers were waiting for CETV valuations at the start of December 2024.",
      "The Department for Education said that number had dropped to 1,344 as of 6 January 2025, but new cases were always coming in.",
      "Amy, from Bristol, teaches history, geography and psychology at a secondary school in Wiltshire.",
      "She has been waiting since July 2024 for a CETV and cannot get divorced without it.",
      "'Hugely stressful'",
      "Both parties in a divorce need to provide accurate information about their finances - including any property, savings, and pensions - even if the split in assets is otherwise straightforward.",
      "\"I was initially told [the Teachers' Pension Scheme] would be in touch within 10 working days,\" she said.",
      "\"But then the person I spoke to said they had no timescale for the calculations to be completed. So holding my breath was not recommended.\"",

      "He said: \"This is the first time I've ever been divorced, so I hadn't heard of [a CETV] before.",
      "\"It's exhausting. It's taken a toll on me mentally because I want to move on with my life and I'm sure my ex-wife wants to do the same. It's financially taking a toll as well. I'm still paying a mortgage on a house.\"",
      "David has also racked up hundreds of pounds in solicitors' fees because of the protracted divorce process.",

      "He said: \"When a pension scheme works out what your pension is worth, it has to do some complicated calculations.",
      "\"But a court judgement means all these public sector schemes have to do some extra complicated calculations. They all need to agree so the teachers and the nurses and the civil service schemes all do it the same way.",
      "\"So that's taken time to agree and then they need expert staff to actually do all of these calculations. All of that is just taking time.\"",
      "The judgement, also known as the McCloud pension remedy, found in 2018 that the government discriminated against younger members of public service pension schemes.",
      "It resulted in the government making changes to public service pension schemes, and calculating valuations in a new way.",
      "Backlog to be cleared",
      "In an update issued on the Teachers' Pensions website in December, the service apologised for the inconvenience caused by the delays.",
      "It said they were due firstly to an embargo on new CETVs between March and July 2023 in order to take account of a change in the way valuations are made.",
      "And once the backlog had built up, new rules came into force after the McCloud judgment meaning that in many cases two calculations were necessary rather than one.",
      "The Department for Education said the delays were not a result of having too few staff and that it was working through cases in date order wherever possible.",
      "It said it aimed to clear the majority of the current backlog by the end of February 2025, apart from some \"small groups\".",
      "'No support'",
      "Music teacher Steph Collishaw, 53, from Frome, in Somerset, has been waiting for her CETV since May 2024.",
      "\"It's made me feel really angry because I've worked for 29 years and have paid into the pension scheme all that time,\" she said.",
      "\"But when I need to depend on information that is rightfully mine, it's simply not there.\"",
      "She said her divorce proceedings had become drawn out and she was currently unable to remortgage as her husband's name was still on the title deeds of her house.",
      "And like many caught up in this delay, she has become sceptical of promises that things will improve quickly.",

      "Her win caps a wild 12 months in which she rocketed from relative obscurity to the top of the charts, thanks to her colourful, 80s-influenced brand of synth-pop.",
      "She was named winner by a panel of more than 180 musicians and experts, including Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa and Sound of 2014 winner Sam Smith.",
      "Jack Saunders, who hosts Radio 1's New Music show, said: \"No one deserves this accolade more than Chappell Roan. She was the most exciting artist of the last 12 months and is now set to be the artist of the next 12 months.\"",
      "An exclusive interview with the singer will be published by Radio 1 and BBC News in the coming weeks.",
      "The 26-year-old has had a long path to success.",
      "Born Kayleigh Amstutz, she was brought up in the conservative city of Willard, Missouri, where she attended church three times a week and was taught that being gay was a sin.",
      "She signed her first record deal in 2017, based on the strength of a song she had uploaded to YouTube called Die Young.",
      "Cast as a singer-songwriter in mould of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, she failed to make much of an impact, and was dropped by her label during the pandemic.",
      "But by that stage, she had already recorded a song that would become her calling card.",
      "Titled Pink Pony Club, it was inspired by a visit to an LA gay club, and helped her define a new sound - camp, liberated and packed with singalong choruses.",
      "The experience also spawned her campy stage persona, which she has described as a \"larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself\".",
      "After finding a new record label, she released her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, in September 2023.",
      "A slow-burning success, it only sold a few thousand copies in its first week of release. But word began to spread - and when she played California's Coachella Festival last April, the crowd that turned up for her mid-afternoon set was huge.",
      "More importantly, the show was broadcast on YouTube - going viral after Roan  leaned into the TV cameras and declared: \"I'm your favourite artist's favourite artist.\" The performance has subsequently been watched more than a million times.",
      "Around the same time, she released a stand-alone single called Good Luck, Babe, that talked about her experience of falling in love with her best friend.",
      "\"It's a pop song with a sad element to it,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"It's very common in queer relationships, when someone is still coming to terms with their queerness, [that] they'll kiss 100 boys to 'stop the feeling', as the song says.",
      "\"And it's like, 'Sure, OK. Your time will come.'\"",
      "The single eventually reached number two in the UK charts, and The Rise And Fall Of The Midwest Princess became a number one album after it was re-released on vinyl last summer.",
      "Since then, Roan has been nominated for six Grammy awards, including album of the year, and won best new artist at the Billboard Music Awards in December.",
      "She has also experienced the downside of her sudden fame, and spoke out about the \"creepy behaviour\" of certain fans who \"yelled\" and \"harassed\" her at private moments; and who had approached her family and friends.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 12:11:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The government is suggesting a cap on the cost of resold tickets, potentially up to 30% on top of the original price.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced plans to cap the price of resale tickets in a clamp-down on ticket touts who bulk buy tickets and then resell them for huge profits.",
      "The cap would apply to tickets in the live events industry including sport, music, comedy and theatre.",
      "It was one of the government's election promises, after complaints from fans and concert-goers about the massively inflated cost of some resale tickets.",
      "A public consultation will now be launched to consider the cap and how much it will be - anywhere from the ticket's face value or up to 30% on top of the original price.",
      "Separately, the government is also putting out a call for evidence on dynamic pricing, which is where the price of tickets rise at times of high demand.",
      "Hundreds of people complained after experiencing dynamic pricing when Oasis tickets went on sale last August, with some fans charged more than \u00a3350 for tickets with an initial face value of \u00a3150.",
      "Oasis ditch dynamic ticket pricing for US gigs",
      "Oasis hit out at Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing after backlash",
      "According to analysis by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), tickets sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.",
      "Investigations by Trading Standards have uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.",
      "Fans for music artists including Coldplay and Taylor Swift have complained that minutes after tickets to their concerts sold out, resale tickets were listed online for thousands of pounds.",
      "The government says its consultation will seek views on capping resale prices on a range, from the original price to up to a 30% uplift.",
      "Ministers are also proposing limiting the number of tickets that resellers can sell, to the maximum they are allowed to purchase in the original ticket sale.",
      "They also want to create new legal obligations for ticket resale websites and apps to oversee the accuracy of information they provide to fans - with Trading Standards and the Competition and Marketing Authority responsible for enforcement.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We are taking action to strengthen consumer protections, stop fans getting ripped off and ensure money spent on tickets goes back into our incredible live events sector, instead of into the pockets of greedy touts.\"",
      "She told BBC Breakfast on Friday: \"This has been going on for years, it's been fleecing fans, and we say time is up for ticket touts, enough is enough.",
      "\"I believe that music belongs to fans, and that fans make the music industry what it is... Fans want to buy tickets but they can't, because I don't know anyone in this country that can afford \u00a31,000... for a ticket.\"",
      "She added: \"Touts are distorting the market because what they're doing is taking those tickets away from fans, inflating the prices and selling them on, so they are denying the fans the price that the ticket company has set and the band want to sell the tickets for, and instead all of that money is pouring into [the touts'] pockets.\"",
      "Alongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.",
      "\"The call for evidence will seek views on how the ticketing system in the live events sector is working for fans and whether the current system provides sufficient protection from unfair practices,\" the governments aid.",
      "Last year, Oasis fans were asked to pay as much as \u00a3350 per ticket, around \u00a3200 more than had been advertised, due to demand.",
      "Previously, Noel and Liam Gallagher said they had not been aware that dynamic pricing would be used for their UK stadium shows next summer - but acknowledged that the roll out of the tickets had not gone as planned.",
      "Ticketmaster has said it does not set prices and that it is down to the \"event organiser\" who \"has priced these tickets according to their market value\".",
      "'Potentially game-changing'",
      "Ticket resale sites have previously defended their services, with Viagogo saying its site ensures resales are \"a secure, safe transaction\".",
      "Viagogo's boss previously told the BBC lots of fans actually prefer buying on Viagogo instead of buying tickets direct.",
      "\"They don't want to be forced to get up on Friday morning and wait in a queue that may or may not happen,\" he says.",
      "In a statement, Viagogo said it would \"continue to constructively engage with the government\".",
      "It added that it will \"look forward to responding in full to the consultation and call for evidence on improving consumer protections in the ticketing market\".",
      "Viagogo boss defends resold Taylor Swift tickets",
      "Meanwhile, Ticketmaster said it would support a cap on the reselling of tickets.",
      "\"Since 2018, our resale has been capped at face value, providing fans a safe place to sell tickets they can't use at the original price set by artists and event organisers,\" it said.",
      "\"We support proposals to introduce an industry-wide resale price cap. We also urge the government to crack down on bots and ban speculative ticket sales.\"",
      "Sarah Cardell, CEO of CMA, added: \"We know from our own work on ticket reselling that fans often have to jump through hoops and can be left out of pocket or turned away at the door.",
      "\"That is why we made recommendations to the previous government to tackle illegal bulk-buying, stop speculative selling and hold platforms accountable for inaccurate ticket information.\"",
      "She said they \"welcome this fresh opportunity to bring in the stronger protections consumers need in this area\".",
      "Fan-to-fan resale site Twickets' founder Richard Davies gave his support to a cap on ticket resale prices, and called on the government to \"investigate a potential cap on booking fees to ensure they remain proportionate and reasonable\".",
      "'Inflated prices'",
      "Campaigners and music artists have welcomed the consultation. UK Music, which represents the UK's music industry, said it wanted a \"clear price cap\".",
      "Musician and DJ Fatboy Slim gave his backing to the government's proposals, saying it was \"great to see money being put back into fans' pockets instead of resellers\".",
      "Labour's Sharon Hodgson, the MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse and has been campaigning for 15 years on the issue, also welcomed the government's proposal.",
      "\"I hope all those who have been affected by the inflated prices, speculative ticket selling or fallen victim to scams that are prolific within the secondary market will get involved in this consultation,\" she said.",
      "FanFair Alliance, a campaign group that was set up against ticket touts, called the measures \"potentially game-changing\".",
      "It pointed to other countries - such as Ireland which banned ticket touting in 2021 - saying it shows \"how legislation to prevent the resale of tickets for profit can massively curb the illegal and anti-consumer practices of online ticket touts and offshore resale platforms. The UK simply needs to follow their example\"."

    "summary": "The Luton-born singer-songwriter has taken fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Rising pop star Myles Smith can still remember the first time he felt famous.",
      "\"This might sound trivial,\" says the singer, \"but I was playing a concert where I asked the audience, 'Does anyone have cookies?'",
      "\"And within about 10 minutes, the whole dressing room was full of cookies.",
      "\"It was the best thing ever.\"",
      "Since that gig, the 26-year-old's career has only grown bigger.",
      "Last year, he scored his first major hit with Stargazing, a feel-good foot-stomper that became the biggest-selling British single of 2024, and even featured on Barack Obama's end of year playlist.",
      "Now, he's been voted into fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025, marking him out as one of the year's most promising new talents.",
      "And in March, he'll receive the Brit Awards' Rising Star prize \u2013 following in the footsteps of Sam Fender, Adele and Rag 'N' Bone Man.",
      "Smith confesses he learned about the accolade while in the grip of a ferocious hangover.",
      "\"The night before, I'd tried to go drink-for-drink with some people who were a lot more experienced than me, and we actually had to call a doctor to my Airbnb,\" he cringes.",
      "\"Finding out I'd got a Brit Award brought me back to life more than any vitamin C ever could.\"",
      "It was, he says \"the most LA I've ever felt\".",
      "It's certainly a long way from his upbringing in Luton.",
      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",
      "Before long, he was writing his own songs \u2013 initially by dreaming up melodies and lyrics to instrumentals he'd found on YouTube, then creating originals on a guitar he'd been given for his ninth birthday.",
      "\"I remember writing this song called Dream Girl, when I was 11,\" he says.",
      "\"It was about a girl at school, and it was bloody awful - but I sang it at school assembly anyway.",
      "\"Terrible decision. She realised it was about her and avoided me every day after that.\"",
      "Undeterred, he started playing at open mic nights around the town \u2013 covering artists like Ed Sheeran and Marcus Mumford while fine-tuning his distinctive folk-pop style.",
      "For a long time, however, music was a side hustle. After completing a sociology degree in 2019, Smith set up his own business, specialising in management and strategic development, and was turning a healthy profit by the time he was 23.",
      "\"I was quite comfortable,\" he says. \"But I understood quite early on that just because I'm good at something, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm passionate about it.\"",
      "He ploughed his earnings into studio sessions, recording an eight-track album called Scars in 2020. But it wasn't until his haunting cover of The Neighbourhood's Sweater Weather went viral in 2022 that he felt confident enough to pack in his day job.",
      "\"Money has never been the way I measure my success, but it was definitely scary,\" he says.",
      "\"It started off very much like plunging into an ice bath and feeling the shock. Like, 'OK, this is real. I don't have a consistent salary coming in, and I don't have the security of knowing how long this is going to take.'",
      "\"But it was a matter of switching mentality - so I wasn't looking at what securities I had lost, but what opportunities I'd gained.\"",

      "1) Chappell Roan",
      "With a growing online fanbase, Smith started interspersing TikTok cover versions with snippets of originals.",
      "The one that made everyone pay attention was Solo \u2013 whose devious wordplay was so obviously memorable (\"Why'd you get me so high/ To leave me solo\") you couldn't quite believe no-one had thought of it before.",
      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",
      "He's got an interesting take on social media. While artists like Halsey and Florence Welch have expressed frustration at record label pressure to create viral videos,  Smith calls TikTok a \"meritocratic system\" that rewards the effort you put in.",
      "\"There's a difference between the chase for virality and building an audience,\" he reasons.",
      "\"If your objective is to go viral, then you're always going to be fighting a losing battle. But if your objective is to establish a community and a place where your music belongs, it becomes a lot more rewarding.\"",
      "When he's not sharing music, there's a thoughtful tone to his social posts. In one recent note, he addressed people who said his music had \"saved their lives\".",
      "\"I need you to know, it wasn't my music, it was you,\" he wrote. \"I know this because I've been where you are. I've clung to songs in the dark searching for something \u2013 anything \u2013 that made me feel like I could keep going.",
      "\"But music didn't save me. What saved me was the smallest part of me that chose to stay, even when it hurt.",
      "\"My songs might walk beside you, but it's your strength that carries you forward.\"",
      "That empathy is baked into Smith's lyrics. His most affecting songs, such as River and Wait For You, are covenants of support for a friend who's drowning in their troubles.",
      "His breakout hit, Stargazing, is also about a moment of human connection \u2013 looking into the cosmos and realising \"the person we fall in love with has been there our whole life\".",
      "He's previously claimed the track was inspired by a sunset in Malibu, but it turns out that that's a little white lie.",
      "Smith actually came up with the folky, clap-along chorus and its central lyric (\"You and I stargazing/ Intertwining souls\") while eating tacos and salsa with his co-writers, Peter Fenn and Jesse Fink, early last year.",
      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",
      "He started posting snippets of the song online almost immediately, and \"from the very first post, the reaction was explosive\".",
      "There was only one problem: they hadn't finished the verses.",
      "For a month, they frantically traded voice notes and Zoom calls, pulling the song into focus in time for a May release. Since then, it's been streamed more than 600 million times.",
      "\"It's quite wild,\" says the singer. \"It's still getting played, seven or eight months down the line, which is awesome.\"",
      "Smith ended 2024 with a clutch of honours \u2013 from his first Brit Award, to being named BBC Introducing's Artist Of The Year \u2013 and the release of his new EP, \u2026A Minute.",
      "At the start of 2025, he's juggling writing sessions for his debut album with a hectic touring schedule that sees him playing 36 shows in 60 days in 16 countries. But if that sounds daunting, he's prepared.",
      "\"It's a lot, for sure, but I used to stand on the edge of my sofa and pretend I was at Glastonbury. So being able to tour, at whatever scale, is just such a privilege that it doesn't feel like hard work.\"",
      "What's more, he's guaranteed to get free cookies.",

      "Like many of the drag queens on the show, The Vivienne was unapologetically unique and hilariously straight-talking, but she also had something more: pizzazz.",
      "Described by judge Michelle Visage as \"the best Snatch Game character in the history of the show\", it was The Vivienne's President Trump impression - complete with pouted lips, orange makeup and a floppy blonde wig - in the Snatch Game that won her the show.",

      "Having adopted the drag name The Vivienne because of a love for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, her weekly outfits on the catwalk were second to none.",
      "On the show, she described her drag style as being \"like a Scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she's had to move back to Liverpool\".",
      "Without a contour line out of place and a perfected walk in stilettos, she wooed the judges with her bold, glitzy and saucy looks.",
      "Her 'Queen Elizabeth walking around Balmoral' outfit, which saw her wear a gold poncho and grey knitted skirt with fluffy ducks attached to it, was one of her most memorable.",
      "Combine that with her doing the floss dance in the outfit and she had viewers, fellow contestants and even RuPaul crying with laughter.",

    "story": [
      "\"Can that chap sit, do we think?\" asks Dr Raj Paw, a senior consultant in the emergency department at Warwick Hospital.",
      "He is speaking about a patient in his 90s  who was brought in after collapsing at home, where he was found cold and confused.",
      "Now he is stable. Could that open up a bed?",
      "\"If we can get him to sit then he could go into one of the chairs, and that would free up his bed,\" Dr Paw says.",
      "This is the sort of conversation doctors and nurses are having in hospitals up and down the country as a severe flu season puts the NHS under pressure.",
      "More than a dozen hospitals have declared critical incidents - including some of those considered among the best in the country.",
      "Earlier this week, the BBC visited Warwick Hospital. It is run by the South Warwickshire trust, which is one of the top rated in the country and has prided itself on the smooth running of its four hospitals.",
      "But the caseload has been overwhelming this week.",
      "Warwick Hospital has 375 beds and at one point the predicted demand was almost 100 more than that. For the first time ever, it's had to declare a critical incident - the highest alert level in the NHS.",
      "The BBC was there when hospital administrators made the call. Declaring a critical incident is a warning to the local health system that things are getting bad. Often, it frees up hospitals to redeploy doctors and create new temporary ward space.",
      "Over a two-day period, the BBC saw doctors and nurses doing just that: finding stop-gap solutions to treat patients in whatever safe settings could be established.",
      "With emergency departments overflowing, sick people need to be treated in the chairs they're sitting in.",
      "Others have had to wait in ambulances parked outside emergency units for hours before they could even be taken inside.",
      "One such patient is Percy, who is in his 80s and experiencing liver failure. He came to hospital because he had been feeling sick and had lost weight over recent weeks.",
      "Dr Arun Jeyakumar, a senior registrar on the ward, is one of the doctors sent out to check on patients like Percy.",
      "Hopping into the ambulance, he has a brief consultation with him. He tells Percy that everything is being done to get him into the hospital.",
      "Percy smiles back weakly, resigned to the wait.",
      "The paramedic who brought him to the hospital is also resigned: he's seen plenty of cases like Percy's this season.",
      "He turns up the heating in the back of the ambulance and sits down again as Dr Jeyakumar hops out and closes the doors.",
      "Back in the emergency department, doctors, nurses and consultants discuss how to make space for new arrivals.",
      "Beds are at an absolute premium in the hospital. So many patients have arrived that a room near the ambulance entrance has been set up for people considered \"fit to sit\".",
      "Every chair is occupied.",
      "\"It isn't ideal,\" one doctor says. \"But it is safe.\"",
      "Porters have to wheel beds through this open space, between patients being treated in chairs and nurses kneeling on the floor to remove cannulas. Drip stands are shuffled back and forth to make room.",
      "We see a nurse taking a patient, who is still attached to a drip, to the loo in a wheelchair.",
      "She leaves the chair in the corridor and helps the patient in. A porter comes and goes to move the vacant wheelchair.",
      "The nurse dashes back out. \"That's my wheelchair,\" she cries.",
      "We roll it back to her and she starts to laugh. \"You can't take your eye off them for a second or another patient will be in it,\" she says - only half joking.",
      "Elsewhere, Percy makes it from the ambulance to the emergency department, after a three hour wait.",
      "\"It's getting worse,\" he says, wincing as he closes his eyes - but it will be another 12 hours before Percy is admitted to a ward.",
      "When we see him finally being moved, he is contorted in his bed from the pain, clutching onto a sick bowl.",
      "Dr Paw's first job during his rounds is to check the cubicles to see who he can move off beds.",
      "He has a full waiting room just beyond the doors and four ambulances banked up outside.",
      "A woman in the last cubicle he visits is crying. Dr Paw receives an update from a nurse on her condition and orders some morphine.",
      "\"You're in the right place,\" he tells the patient. \"We'll sort out your pain.\"",
      "Dr Paw tells us: \"The people that come in now are sicker than they used to be. And here we are, trying to get them out quicker.\"",
      "He then moves on to a man who was admitted for a heart attack two days ago but is no longer receiving active treatment. Can he safely be moved, Dr Paw wonders.",
      "\"These are the decisions we're being forced to make,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I'm considering moving a heart attack patient to the waiting room so I can have his cubicle.\"",
      "Another patient Dr Paw saw the previous day is still waiting for a bed in the ward more than 24 hours later.",
      "\"It's rubbish. It's not what should happen,\" Dr Paw says. \"People shouldn't be spending 27, 28 hours in an emergency department.\"",
      "At one point during our time at the hospital we were taken to a bank of screens displaying statistics.",
      "It showed that patients in the emergency department were waiting nearly 30 hours for a bed and there were six ambulances queued up outside. One had been there for four hours.",
      "\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" one doctor says.",
      "South Warwickshire Trust stood down the critical incident on Thursday \u2013 it had been in place for 48 hours. Staff told the BBC though that the pressures on the hospital were still intense."

      "A large UK study has found further evidence that people with more calcium in their diet - equivalent to a glass of milk a day - can help reduce their risk of bowel cancer.",

      "Quantifying exactly what those percentages mean is tricky, because everyone's risk of bowel cancer is different depending on their lifestyle, diet, habits and genetics.",
      "What does calcium do? What foods contain it?",
      "Calcium is an important mineral for strengthening bones and keeping your teeth healthy, but there is growing evidence it also protects against some cancers.",
      "There is lots of calcium in milk, yoghurt and cheese. Dairy products are one of the main sources of it in the UK diet (we love our cereals in the morning).",
      "It is also present in other foods like soya and rice drinks, white bread, nuts, seeds and fruits like dried figs, curly kale and canned sardines, and it is also in lactose-free milk.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

      "Listen to this article",
      "Listen to this article",
      "Jane Graham has been a school nurse for nearly 20 years \u2013 and during this time the nature of her work has completely changed. \"When I started, the majority of the support we provided was for physical health, like asthma, allergic reactions and injuries,\" she says. \"Now it's mental health.\"",
      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "But it is not just a crisis that is placing demands on the health service. It's also depriving the economy of workers with rising numbers of young people being left unable to work.",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",

      "UK borrowing costs have been rising in recent months. The cost of borrowing over 10 years hit its highest level since 2008, while the pound has fallen and on Friday dropped below $1.22 against the dollar after stronger-than-expected job figures in the US.",
      "When borrowing costs go up, usually the pound does too, but analysts suggest  wider concerns about the strength of the UK economy have driven sterling lower.",
      "On Thursday, the Treasury ruled out any emergency intervention in the markets, saying they continued to \"function in an orderly way\".",
      "Globally, there has been a rise in the cost of government borrowing in recent months sparked by investor concerns that US President-elect Donald Trump's plans to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China would push up inflation.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" and which the government uses to raise money -  are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",

      "Sir John said what was happening to long-term yields in the UK reflected what was happening to yields in the US.",
      "\"[In] the US, markets are taking a different view of how their economy is going to go once President Trump is in office and their rates have gone up to 4.75% on 10-year Treasuries and ours have gone up in parallel to that. So I don't think this is a response to something we've done,\" he said.",
      "On Friday, US hiring figures surged for December, with 256,000 jobs added. Economists had expected 160,000 new roles.",
      "The stronger data, along with a small dip in the unemployment rate, reinforces the view that there is no pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates quickly in order to boost the economy.",
      "This could impact the path taken by the Bank of England as policymakers closely watch moves made by their counterparts in the world's largest economy.",
      "In response to the figures, the yield on 10-year US bonds rose to almost 4.79%, the highest in 14 months.",
      "The yield on UK 10-year gilts, meanwhile, remained above 4.8%, the highest since August 2008.",
      "Sir John said what was different about the UK was the Treasury had tried to reassure markets by saying it would stick to its fiscal rules.",
      "\"But it's becoming clearer and clearer that that's going to be very difficult,\" he said.",
      "Reeves has previously committed to only one fiscal event a year - where she can raise taxes - which would likely be in a Budget in the autumn.",
      "If she needs more money before that, a squeeze on spending is more likely.",
      "On 26 March the government's independent forecaster will put out its latest projections for the economy and will say whether the chancellor is likely to meet her fiscal rules.",
      "A spending review, which sets government department spending, will follow in June.",
      "Sir John said it would require difficult decisions from the chancellor in the spending review and then the Budget.",
      "\"The choice she's going to face... is can I raise borrowing - and the increase in interest rates that's happened now, if it continues, will decrease her scope for doing that within her rules - or do I increase taxes again, or do I actually institute some very severe reductions and squeezes on public services.\"",

    "summary": "No 10 insists millions of people share Sir Keir's view of the Truss government's economic record.",
    "story": [
      "Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has sent a legal \"cease and desist\" letter to Sir Keir Starmer demanding he stop saying she \"crashed the economy\".",
      "Her lawyers argue the claim made repeatedly by Sir Keir is \"false and defamatory\", and harmed her politically in the run-up to losing her South West Norfolk seat in the general election.",
      "Truss was the UK's shortest-serving PM, forced to resign after just 49 days in office when borrowing costs soared in the aftermath of her government's mini-budget.",
      "The prime minister's spokesman suggested Truss should also write to \"millions of people up and down the country\" who, he said, had seen their mortgage bills pushed up by her economic policies.",
      "Pound falls to lowest in over a year as borrowing costs soar",
      "The inside story of the mini-budget disaster",
      "How much market chaos did the mini-budget cause?",
      "Sir Keir \"absolutely stands by\" his language about the previous government's record, the spokesman told reporters.",
      "Responding on X, Truss said: \"I know Keir Starmer won't repeat his allegations that I crashed the economy because he knows it's a lie.\"",
      "Earlier, Commons leader Lucy Powell told MPs \"we won't cease and desist from telling the truth that they [the Conservatives] crashed the economy\".",
      "Also speaking in the Commons, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the previous Conservative government had \"ruined the lives of people across this country\" through their \"hubris\" and \"recklessness\".",
      "It comes as the pound fell to its lowest level in over a year and government borrowing costs have surged to their highest level in 16 years.",
      "Economists have warned these rising costs could force further tax rises or cuts in spending as the government tries to meet its self-imposed rule not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Jones insisted there was \"no need for an emergency intervention\" in financial markets.",
      "Movements in borrowing costs were being driven by \"a wide range of international and domestic factors,\" he said.",
      "Tory shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour's tax rises would be \"swallowed up by the higher borrowing costs at no benefit to the British people\".",
      "A \"cease and desist\" letter usually represents a warning that the recipient will face legal action if they continue the allegedly unlawful activity.",
      "In the letter sent to Sir Keir on Thursday, Truss's lawyers say his statements about their client are \"false and misleading\".",
      "\"Their publication is not only extremely damaging but also grossly defamatory and indefensible... It would be hard to avoid a conclusion that they were made maliciously,\" the letter adds.",
      "Truss's lawyers say they are seeking \"an amicable basis on which you will agree to cease repetition of what is clearly a factually incorrect and defamatory statement about our client.",

      "The letter argues that the movements in financial markets during Truss's tenure in No 10 should not be classified as an economic crash.",
      "The weeks following the mini-budget delivered by Truss's chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng in September 2022, which included wide-ranging tax cuts, saw sharply adverse market reaction, and mortgage costs soared.",
      "But in a video posted on X after Downing Street's comments, Truss said Labour, the Bank of England and \"the media establishment smeared my budget and forced a reversal\".",
      "\"Now, they've plunged the country into economic crisis,\" she added.",
      "During the Conservative Party conference last October, the former prime minister said it would be \"economic illiteracy\" to suggest that tax rises from Labour - at that point anticipated in Rachel Reeves' upcoming first Budget - were a result of her economic inheritance.",
      "Last July, shortly after Labour took office, civil servants changed documents describing the mini-budget as \"disastrous\" after she complained they showed \"flagrant\" political bias.",

    "story": [
      "When David Lammy is asked about the new government's relations with the incoming US administration, he likes to talk about the dinner he and the prime minister had with Donald Trump in New York last September.",
      "\"We had a very good meal,\" the foreign secretary said on Thursday. \"We had a long time to discuss the issues. He was an extremely gracious host, very affable, very warm indeed about our great country.\"",
      "And throughout a series of media interviews, briefings and a speech at the Foreign Office, Lammy talked up UK-US relations, even daring to speak of a \"special relationship\", a phrase largely avoided by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.",
      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",
      "But what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.",
      "The president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric.",
      "His language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".",
      "He said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"",
      "Musk looms large over UK politics as MPs return for 2025",
      "How Elon Musk seized on baseless memo claim to fuel wave of misinformation",
      "Lammy played down the influence of Elon Musk, the wealthy ally of Trump who in recent days has personally attacked British ministers on X. He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.",
      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",
      "He and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister.",
      "In the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected."

      "Alongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.",

      "About 40 tractors rolled into the streets of Oxford city centre blaring their horns, as Environment Secretary Steve Reed addressed a national farming conference.",
      "In his speech, Reed he was \"sorry\" decisions had upset farmers but argued \"stable finances are the foundation of the economic growth needed\".",
      "The comments came as he set out the government's 25-year plan to make farming more profitable.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw said farmers \"are worried about making it to the end of 2025, never mind what happens 25 years down the line\".",
      "Outside the conference, protest organiser Caroline Graham told the BBC that the government's current policies were \"crucifying\" farmers.",

      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich - for example, in terms of their land and livestock - they are cash poor and the changes would mean they would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "Mrs Graham, a widowed farmer, from Berkshire, said: \"If those taxes had existed when my husband died I would have had to sell the farm.",

      "\"He should be on farms listening to genuine farming people.\"",
      "Inside the conference, as tractors blared their horns outside, Reed repeated Labour's claim of a \u00a322bn deficit left by the last government. He told delegates: \"We were shocked by the size of the financial black hole we were left to fill.",

      "Pressed by reporters, Reed said he was apologising for having \"to take decisions that are very difficult for the sector because of what we inherited\".",
      "In his speech, Reed said the government would offer a \"new deal for farmers\" that would help them become more profitable.",
      "Measures under the deal include delivering Labour's manifesto pledge to ensure that 50% of food in schools, hospitals, army bases and prisons paid for with public sector money would come from local farms or would be produced to high environmental standards.",
      "Reed told the BBC that could be worth \u00a32.5bn to domestic food producers, adding: \"What I am announcing today are hard measures that will put money directly into farmers' pockets for the hard work they put in to put food on all of our tables.\"",

      "Mr Hunt said: \"I think the medical examiner system, when it works well, is incredibly important to a healthcare system because I think it's not just important for learning from mistakes, it's also very important for families who have been bereaved to have someone independent that they can talk to and raise concerns.",
      "\"Feedback from relatives was a very important clue for them as to where things might be going wrong.\"",

    "story": [
      "An attempt by the Conservatives to have the government set up a national inquiry into grooming gangs has been voted down by 364 votes to 111 votes, a margin of 253.",
      "The amendment was attached to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which would have been killed had the vote passed.",
      "Earlier in the day, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch argued the government risks fuelling accusations of \"a cover up\" by refusing an inquiry.",
      "But Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer argued that several inquiries had already been held into abuse carried out by gangs of men and a new probe would only delay the action the victims wanted.",
      "The amendment was largely symbolic, as the size Labour's majority meant it was never likely to pass.",
      "It would also have killed a major piece of government legislation, the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill includes measures aimed at protecting children and tougher rules around home-schooling, as well as changes to academies.",

      "Sir Keir said it was \"shocking\" Conservative MPs would try to block a bill aimed at helping vulnerable children by voting for the Tory amendment and accused Badenoch of \"weak leadership\".",
      "He said \"reasonable people could agree or disagree\" on whether there should be a fresh probe and acknowledged that there were mixed views among victims and survivors.",
      "Chris Philp, the Conservative shadow home secretary, condemned Labour's vote against the amendment as \"morally wrong\".",
      "Asked why the Conservatives had brought the amendment, given its limited chances of success, Philp said: \"When you're in opposition you need to use every parliamentary device available to try and bring issues to the fore.\"",

      "However, he accused Badenoch of only recently taking an interest in the subject and said she had failed to take action when she was in government.",
      "\"I can't recall her once raising this issue in the House, once calling for a national inquiry,\" he said.",
      "Making her argument for a fresh inquiry during her debate with Sir Keir, Badenoch said \"no one has joined the dots, no one has the total picture\".",
      "She noted that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which lasted for seven years and concluded in 2022, had not had a specific focus on grooming gangs.",
      "She said a new inquiry could explore \"if there was a racial and cultural motivation to some of these crimes\".",
      "A local Rotherham inquiry uncovered the sexual abuse of 1,400 children over 16 years, mainly by British Pakistani men.",
      "In Telford, up to 1,000 girls faced abuse over 40 years, with some cases overlooked due to \"nervousness about race\" as most suspects were men of south Asian heritage.",
      "Badenoch accused the PM of not wanting questions asked \"of Labour politicians who may be complicit\" in previous cases.",
      "The current row over the subject was triggered after GB News reported that the government had refused Oldham Council's request for a government-led inquiry into historical child sexual exploitation.",
      "Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, has made numerous incendiary interventions on the subject including accusing Sir Keir of being \"complicit in the rape of Britain\".",
      "Following Prime Minister's Questions, Musk posted a message on social media urging MPs to back an inquiry adding \"hundreds of thousands of little girls in Britain who were, and still are, being systematically, horrifically gang-raped deserve some justice in this world\".",
      "Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, who turned down the request, has argued that in her experience locally-led inquiries, such as the one held in Telford, were more effective at implementing change.",
      "However, speaking to Sky News she said \"nothing is off the table\" adding: \"If the victims come forward to me in this victims panel and they say, 'actually, we think there needs to be a national inquiry into this', I'll listen to them.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said that \"significant\" engagement with victims' groups had shown \"they do not want to see a national inquiry, they want action taken to deliver justice\", but that the prime minister \"always remains open-minded\".",

      "All five Reform UK MPs backed the amendment, after spending the week demanding a national inquiry.",
      "Despite the support Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, labelled Conservatives' interest in the grooming gangs \"insincere\".",
      "He added that if the government would not call an inquiry, Reform would raise money to appoint \"independent arbiters\" to examine the subject."

    "summary": "The planned measures will target the finances of illegal smuggling networks, the Home Office says.",
    "story": [
      "New sanctions targeting the finances of people smuggling networks will make it harder for gangs to profit from the deadly trade, the Home Office has said.",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that would involve freezing the bank accounts and assets of \"those that help to get people into this country\" illegally, as well as travel bans.",

      "\"We have to accept that there is no going back, we must stop the 1990s clouding our vision,\" Lammy said.",

      "Officials admit they do not know how many people smugglers may be targeted or how many assets, if any, they have in UK banks.",
      "The announcement on people smuggling is the start of the process and much remains unclear. Sanctions are highly technical and legal and the new regime will take many months to be drawn up.",
      "In his speech, Lammy said the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCDO) was \"critical\" to tackling irregular migration.",
      "\"A realistic strategy involves transactional, hardheaded diplomacy, and to agree with partners, smart interventions at every stage along the international people smuggling pathway,\" he added.",
      "Lammy said the sanctions aimed to \"prevent, combat, deter and disrupt\" people smuggling into the UK.",
      "Under the proposed measures, which are yet to be finalised, UK-based individuals and financial institutions would be banned by law from dealing with sanctioned groups.",
      "The government will bring forward new legislation for the scheme, drawn up by government sanction experts alongside law enforcement and Home Office staff.",
      "Many smugglers operate in an informal cash-based network, making it hard for the authorities to target their assets.",
      "It could be easier to sanction the supply chains helping the people smugglers, and the middle men joining up the networks and helping to move asylum seekers across Europe to northern France.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of his speech, Lammy said: \"When we look at the manufacture, the storage, the transportation of many of those boats... there are companies that sit behind that, often in other nations\".",
      "\"We know who those companies are, we can go after those value chains and supply chains,\" he added.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the move would deprive the gangs of the \"illicit finance fuelling their operations\".",
      "In an article for the Daily Mail, the prime minister said the gangs \"only care about one thing: money\" and he promised to \"hit them where it hurts\".",

      "She noted Ms Bird was not prevented from returning to work, and so the sum made allowances for the unfair process involved in her removal but not for her lack of progress in her political career.",

      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the last few days. On Tuesday it was worth $1.25 but is currently trading at $1.23.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",

      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",

      "\"The government can take a local plan off a local authority that is resisting putting one in place, and we are absolutely willing to do it, if we have evidence that [they] are refusing to comply,\" he told the BBC.",

      "The government said it had \"inherited the worst housing crisis in living memory\" and \"all areas must play their part\".",
      "It has set out \"a major planning overhaul\u2026 unblocking barriers to building, and setting out targets for councils to ramp up housebuilding, so new homes are built where they are most needed.\"",
      "Most housing experts agree planning reform is necessary.",
      "Yet analysts say it is not the only obstacle.",
      "The construction industry has warned it is dealing with a chronic shortage of skilled workers.",

      "There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials including bricks and timber.",
      "The Construction Leadership Council has warned a shortage of these could hinder the government's ability to get near its target.",
      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",
      "This is because private housebuilders have a commercial interest in not building so many new homes that their average price declines.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",

      "About the data",

      "The targets are the government's new \"local housing need\" calculations, released following a public consultation.",
      "Planning statistics are taken from quarterly data and combine applications decided for \"minor\" housing developments (fewer than 10 homes) and \"major\" schemes (10 homes or more).",
      "The planning data for England is at local authority level. Applications decided by special authorities, such as those in charge of national parks, are not included.",

      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

      "The world's richest man has been sounding off in the strongest possible terms about the prime minister for almost as long as Sir Keir Starmer has been in Downing Street.",
      "In recent days, the focus has been on child sexual exploitation and Musk's allegation that the prime minister was \"complicit in the rape of Britain\" when he was Director of Public Prosecutions by failing to deal with the scandal.",
      "I'm told Sir Keir \"will not want to get into a food fight with Musk\" but will make a robust defence of his time as chief prosecutor.",
      "He is also keen to emphasise the importance of political debate being grounded in verifiable facts and that Musk is making claims that are \"blatantly untrue\" as one source put it.",
      "Sources point, for instance, to those defending the Prime Minister's record as DPP, including another former senior prosecutor who took to X - the social media platform Musk owns - to say Sir Keir oversaw a record number of child abuse convictions.",
      "Those in government also point to the local inquiries there have been into the abuse and rape of vulnerable young girls by groups of men mainly of Pakistani descent \u2013 and the national inquiry conducted by Professor Alexis Jay.",
      "The Conservatives, Reform and Elon Musk have each expressed varying degrees of outrage in recent days that the government has said no to a public inquiry into the scandal.",
      "But few expected this weekend's twist: that within hours of the Reform leader Nigel Farage describing Musk as a \"hero\" who \"makes us look cool,\" the X owner said Reform needed a new leader as Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\".",
      "\"It's not been the perfect day,\" said one Reform figure with a splash of understatement and a smile. \"We probably do look a bit silly.\"",
      "Farage's repeated statements distancing himself from the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley Lennon, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, appear to be at the heart of the spat.",

      "\"Nigel is not for sale,\" is how one senior party figure put it to me, saying this showed that the Reform leader was willing to stand up to anybody, including the richest man in the world.",
      "Another said that if Reform were to be treated as a serious political outfit - and remember, Nigel Farage has said he wants to win the next general election - that means robustly and consistently rejecting any association with Robinson, whatever the consequences.",
      "The one politician to attract some praise from Elon Musk, for now at least, is the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, for her calls for a public inquiry into child sexual abuse.",
      "Badenoch sees the scandal as a case study in what she sees as our broken politics.",

      "Reform invited journalists to verify that this was not the case and the Financial Times among others concluded there was \"strong evidence\" the party's tally was accurate.",
      "In the coming weeks, we can expect to hear from Badenoch about the so-called Policy Commissions she is setting up, and who will lead them.",

      "He is her shadow justice secretary but his willingness to carry on campaigning almost as if the leadership race was still on is irking some senior Tories, who want him to stay in his lane on policy and not stray all over the place talking about whatever he likes.",

    "summary": "Last year was the world's warmest on record, bringing temperatures above a politically symbolic milestone.",
    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",

    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "UK to finish with coal power after 142 years",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "As a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.",
      "Back in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.",
      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",
      "Britain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.",
      "On around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.",
      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",
      "Last month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.",

    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

    "story": [
      "The fate of two killer whales is uncertain following the closure of a marine zoo in France on Sunday.",
      "Campaigners and the zoo's managers have been locked in disagreement about what should happen to the orca whales with the French government already blocking one proposal to rehome them.",
      "Last month Marineland Antibes, located near Cannes in the French Riviera, said it would permanently shut on 5 January following new animal welfare laws.",
      "The legislation, which bans the use of dolphins and whales in marine zoo shows, was passed in 2021 but comes into effect next year.",
      "Marineland, which describes itself as the largest of its kind in Europe, currently keeps two killer whales - Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo.",
      "The killer whale that can 'speak'",
      "France bans captive breeding of dolphins",
      "Managers say shows featuring killer whales and dolphins attract 90% of Marineland's visitors \u2013 and that without it the business isn't viable.",
      "Several destinations for the whales have been proposed but there is disagreement on where they should go and what should happen to them.",
      "Most experts agree that releasing the two whales, which are Icelandic orcas specifically, into the wild would not be suitable as both were born in captivity and would not have the skills to survive.",
      "\"It's a bit like taking your dog out of the house and sending him into the woods to live freely as a wolf,\" says Hanne Strager.",
      "In 2023 the marine biologist published The Killer Whale Journals, which details her decades long interest in the ocean predator and how they behave.",
      "\"Those whales, that have spent their entire lives in captivity, their closest relationship is with humans. They are the ones who have provided them with food, care, activities and social relations.",
      "\"Killer whales are highly social animals, as social as we [humans] are, and they depend on social bonds. They have established those bonds with their trainers \u2026 They depend on humans and that is the only thing they know.\"",
      "A deal to send Wikie and Keijo to a marine zoo in Japan, backed by managers at Marineland, caused outcry among campaigners who said they would receive worse treatment.",
      "Last November the French government blocked the deal, saying the animal welfare laws in Japan were relaxed compared to those in Europe and that the 13,000km (8,000 mile) journey would cause stress to the orcas.",
      "Another option is to send them to a Spanish marine zoo in the Canary Islands.",
      "Loro Parque, in Tenerife, complies with European animal welfare standards but campaigners fear Wikie and Keijo will still be made to perform there.",
      "There have also been several orca deaths there in the last few years.",
      "A 29-year-old male called Keto passed away in November and three other orcas died there between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Loro Parque say scientific examinations of those three orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria show the deaths were unavoidable.",
      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection (Wap), tells the BBC: \"It would be devastating for Wikie and Keijo to end up in another entertainment venue like Loro Parque \u2013 from one whale jail to another.\"",
      "Wap want the orcas to be rehomed in an adapted ocean bay.",
      "\"[We and] many others have urged the government of France to do everything it can to facilitate the movement of the orcas to a sanctuary off the coast of Nova Scotia.\"",
      "'We'll close off a bay for them'",
      "The organisation hoping to build the facility in eastern Canada say it would be able to attract funding if it received a commitment from the French government to send the two whales there.",
      "The Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP) proposes to close off an area of seawater measuring 40 hectares (98 acres) with nets.",
      "Wikie and Keijo could then use the large expanse of water, with human support from vets and welfare workers, until the end of their lives.",
      "The average lifespan of a male killer whale is about 30 years, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency. Females usually live about 50 years.",
      "\"Life at the sanctuary will be as close as is possible to what they would have experienced growing up in the ocean,\" say the WSP. \"It will be a new life that will make up for so much of what went before.\"",
      "This kind of project has been done before.",
      "Keiko, the orca that starred in the 1993 move Free Willy, was rescued from captivity in 1996 before being taken to a bay in Iceland in 1998.",
      "Unlike Wikie and Keijo, he was born in the wild and was able to relearn some of the necessary survival skills while living in the bay for four years.",
      "He eventually left with a pod of orcas he had joined and swam to Norway where he died in 2003 following an infection.",
      "Strager warns that the proposed sanctuary might feel as alien to Wikie and Keijo as open ocean would.",
      "\"We have this conception that animals enjoy freedom in the same sense we do, 'now they are free and they will love it.'",
      "\"We don't know if they see freedom the same way ... Are they going to be scared because it is so different to what they're used to? I don't know.\"",
      "She tells the BBC: \"I don't think there are any good solutions for animals that have been kept in captivity their whole lives.\"",
      "More than 4,000 animals will be moved out of Marineland, which was founded in 1970 by Count Roland de la Poype.",
      "He was a decorated fighter pilot who fought during World War Two before establishing himself in the plastics industry and opening Marineland due to his interest in sea life.",
      "The closure of his passion project is the latest step in a campaign targeting marine zoos that has gained momentum over the last 15 years.",
      "The actress Pamela Anderson called for the closure of Marineland in 2017 and held a protest outside its entrance saying \"captivity kills\".",
      "In 2013, the documentary Blackfish detailed how an orca called Tilikum killed trainer Dawn Brancheau after a show at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010.",
      "He grabbed her and dragged her into the water where he tore off her arm and drowned her.",
      "The film also outlines how Tilikum was also involved in the deaths of two other people.",
      "Researchers interviewed in the film argued that orcas captured from the wild and trained to perform become violent in captivity.",
      "Visitor numbers and financial revenues at SeaWorld suffered in the aftermath of the documentary and in 2016 they suspended their captive breeding programme.",
      "They rejected calls to release their remaining orcas into the wild, saying they would likely die if left to fend for themselves.",
      "Eighteen months ago they opened a new marine zoo in the United Arab Emirates, SeaWorld's first outside the US.",
      "The new facility in Abu Dhabi is a $1.2bn (\u00a3966m) venture with state-owned leisure developer Miral and boasts the largest aquarium in the world.",

      "Wap have helped convince Expedia not to sell any more holidays involving performances by dolphins in captivity and want other travel companies to do the same.",
      "\"Blackfish was more than a hit \u2013 it was a phenomenon,\" writes the scientist Naomi Rose in a report by Wap. \"I am convinced it pushed western society past the tipping point on the subject of captive cetaceans.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a law that bans TikTok in the US over national security concerns unless its China-based parent company sells the platform ahead of a 19 January deadline.",
      "The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a  violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US.",
      "The US government argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "A decision by the top court has to be made within days. President-elect Donald Trump - who returns to the White House in just over a week - now argues against the ban.",
      "The law requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell it in the US or cease operations on 19 January. The company has said it will not sell the short-form video platform.",
      "Congress passed the law with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties - a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people.",
      "The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.",
      "TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
      "Noel Francisco, a former US solicitor general appearing for the platform, stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship.",
      "He argued that  \"the government cannot restrict speech in order to protect us from speech\".",
      "\"That's precisely what this law does from beginning to end.\"",

      "But he said that under the First Amendment, mere ideas do not represent a national security threat.",
      "Justice department lawyer Elizabeth B Prelogar told  the court that ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government made it a national security risk.",
      "She told the court that Beijing \"could weaponise TikTok at any time to harm the United States\".",

      "TikTok's lawyer told the court on Friday that, as he saw it, the platform would \"go dark\" on 19 January without intervention.",
      "Ms Prelogar, arguing for the US justice department, said \"nothing permanent\" had to happen on that day and there was still time for a sale.",
      "Forcing the app to go dark could be just the \"jolt\" ByteDance needs to seriously consider a sale, she said.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,\" she said, comparing the situation to \"game of chicken\" and one in which the US should not \"blink first\".",
      "After the hearing, legal observers predicted that the Supreme Court's justices appeared to be swayed by the government's concerns.",
      "\"Traditionally the Supreme Court has been willing to defer somewhat when national security is at stake,\" said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",

    "title": "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:17:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "\"I remember I shouted, I cried, I even insulted him,\" she says. \"It was like an earthquake. A tsunami.\"",
      "Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail at the end of a historic three-and-a-half month trial in December.",
      "More than four years later, Darian says that her father \"should die in prison\".",
      "Fifty men who Dominique Pelicot recruited online to come rape and sexually assault his unconscious wife Gis\u00e8le were also sent to jail.",
      "He was caught by police after upskirting in a supermarket, leading investigators to look closer at him. On this seemingly innocuous retired grandfather's laptop and phones, they found thousands of videos and photos of his wife Gis\u00e8le, clearly unconscious, being raped by strangers.",
      "On top of pushing issues of rape and gender violence into the spotlight, the trial also highlighted the little-known issue of chemical submission - drug-facilitated assault.",
      "Caroline Darian has made it her life's struggle to fight chemical submission, which is thought to be under-reported as the majority of victims don't have any recollection of the assaults and may not even realise they were drugged.",
      "Darian wants abused women's voices to be heard",
      "In the days that followed Gis\u00e8le's fateful phone call, Darian and her brothers, Florian and David, travelled to the south of France where their parents had been living to support their mother as she absorbed the news that - as Darian now puts it - her husband was \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 or 30 years\".",
      "Soon afterwards, Darian herself was called in by police - and her world shattered again.",
      "She was shown two photos they found on her father's laptop. They showed an unconscious woman lying on a bed, wearing only a T-shirt and underwear.",
      "At first, she couldn't tell the woman was her. \"I lived a dissociation effect. I had difficulties recognising myself from the start,\" she says.",

      "Unlike her mother's case, there is no proof of what Pelicot may have done to Darian.",
      "\"And that's the case for how many victims? They are not believed because there's no evidence. They're not listened to, not supported,\" she says.",

      "She says that in the midst of the trauma of finding out she had been raped more than 200 times by different people, her mother Gis\u00e8le found it difficult to accept that her husband may have also assaulted their daughter.",

      "Yet when Gis\u00e8le decided to open up the trial to the public and the media so as to expose what had been done to her by her husband and dozens of men, mother and daughter were in agreement: \"I knew we went through something... horrible, but that we had to go through it with dignity and strength.\"",
      "Now, Darian needs to understand how to live knowing she is the daughter of both the torturer and the victim - something she calls \"a terrible burden\".",
      "She is now unable to think back to her childhood with the man she calls Dominique, only occasionally slipping back into the habit of referring to him as her father.",
      "\"When I look back I don't really remember the father that I thought he was. I look straight to the criminal, the sexual criminal he is,\" she says.",
      "\"But I have his DNA and the main reason why I am so engaged for invisible victims is also for me a way to put a real distance with this guy,\" she tells Emma Barnett. \"I am totally different from Dominique.\"",

      "\"He is a dangerous man. There is no way he can get out. No way.\"",
      "It will be years before Dominique Pelicot, 72, is eligible for parole, so it is possible he will never see his family again.",
      "Meanwhile, the Pelicots are rebuilding themselves. Gis\u00e8le, Darian says, is exhausted from the trial, but also \"recovering... She is doing well\".",
      "As for Darian, the only question she is interested in now is to raise awareness of chemical submission - and to better educate children on sexual abuse.",
      "She derives strength from her husband, her brothers and her 10-year-old - her \"lovely son\", she says with a smile, her voice full of affection.",

      "\"Can you confirm that Mr Mohammed is pleading guilty to all charges and specifications without exceptions or substitutions?\" the judge asked his lawyer as Mohammed watched on.",
      "\"Yes, we can, Your Honour,\" the lawyer responded.",
      "Sitting in court, 59-year-old Mohammed, his beard dyed bright orange and wearing a headdress, tunic and trousers, bore little resemblance to a photo circulated shortly after his capture in 2003.",
      "Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks on the US, had been due to plead guilty this week - more than 23 years after almost 3,000 people were killed in what the US government has described as \"the most egregious criminal act on American soil in modern history\".",
      "But two days later, just as Mohammed had been set to formally enter his decision - the product of a controversial deal he struck with US government prosecutors - he instead watched silently as the judge said the proceedings had been paused under the orders of a federal appeals court.",
      "It was expected to be a landmark week for a case that has faced a decade of delays. Now, with a new complication, it continues into an uncertain future.",
      "\"It's going to be the forever trial,\" the relative of one of the 9/11 victims said.",
      "A plea on hold",
      "Mohammed has previously said that he planned the \"9/11 operation from A-to-Z\" - conceiving the idea of training pilots to fly commercial planes into buildings and taking those plans to Osama bin Laden, leader of the militant Islamist group al-Qaeda.",
      "But he has not yet been able to formally admit guilt to the court. This week's pause comes amid a dispute over a deal reached last year between US prosecutors and his legal team, under which Mohammed would not face a death penalty trial in exchange for his guilty plea.",
      "The US government has for months tried to rescind the agreement, saying that allowing the deal to go ahead would cause \"irreparable\" harm to both it and the American public. Those in support of the deal see it as the only way forward in a case that has been complicated by the torture that Mohammed and others faced in US custody and questions over whether this taints the evidence.",

    "summary": "The former US president halted a US-North Korea showdown, but was also accused of going rogue.",
    "story": [
      "Three decades ago, the world was on the brink of a nuclear showdown - until Jimmy Carter showed up in North Korea.",
      "In June 1994, the former US president arrived for talks in Pyongyang with then leader Kim Il-sung. It was unprecedented, marking the first time a former or sitting US president had visited.",
      "But it was also an extraordinary act of personal intervention, one which many believe narrowly averted a war between the US and North Korea that could have cost millions of lives. And it led to a period of greater engagement between Pyongyang and the West.",
      "All this may not have happened if not for a set of diplomatic chess moves by Carter, who died aged 100 on 29 December.",
      "\"Kim Il-sung and Bill Clinton were stumbling into a conflict, and Carter leapt into the breach, successfully finding a path for negotiated resolution of the standoff,\" North Korean expert John Delury, of Yonsei University, told the BBC.",
      "In early 1994, tensions were running high between Washington and Pyongyang, as officials tried to negotiate an end to North Korea's nuclear programme.",
      "US intelligence agencies suspected that despite ongoing talks, North Korea may have secretly developed nuclear weapons.",
      "Then, in a startling announcement, North Korea said it had begun withdrawing thousands of fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear reactor for reprocessing. This violated an earlier agreement with the US under which such a move required the presence of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog.",
      "North Korea also announced it would withdraw from the IAEA.",
      "American suspicion spiked as Washington believed Pyongyang was preparing a weapon, and US officials broke off negotiations. Washington began preparing several retaliatory measures, including initiating UN sanctions and reinforcing troops in South Korea.",
      "In subsequent interviews, US officials revealed they also contemplated dropping a bomb or shooting a missile at Yongbyon - a move which they knew would have likely resulted in war on the Korean peninsula and the destruction of the South's capital, Seoul.",
      "It was in this febrile atmosphere that Carter made his move.",
      "For years, he had been quietly wooed by Kim Il-sung, who had sent him personal entreaties to visit Pyongyang. In June 1994, upon hearing Washington's military plans, and following discussions with his contacts in the US government and China - North Korea's main ally - Carter decided to finally accept Kim's invitation.",

      "'It was destiny': How Jimmy Carter embraced China and changed history",
      "'How Jimmy Carter kept me alive in Iran'",
      "\"I think we were on the verge of war,\" he told the US public broadcaster PBS years later. \"It might very well have been a second Korean War, within which a million people or so could have been killed, and a continuation of the production of nuclear fissile material\u2026 if we hadn't had a war.\"",
      "Carter's visit was marked by skillful diplomatic footwork - and brinkmanship.",
      "First, Carter had to test Kim's sincerity. He made a series of requests, all of which were agreed to, except the last: Carter wanted to travel to Pyongyang from Seoul across the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a strip of land that acts as a buffer between the two Koreas.",
      "\"Their immediate response was that no-one had ever done this for the last 43 years, that even the United Nations secretary-general had to go to Pyongyang through Beijing. And I said, 'Well, I'm not going, then',\" he said.",
      "A week later, Kim caved.",
      "The next step for Carter was harder - convincing his own government to let him go. Robert Gallucci, the chief US negotiator with North Korea at the time, later said there was \"discomfort in almost all quarters\" about the US essentially \"subcontracting its foreign policy\" to a former president.",
      "Carter first sought permission from the State Department, who blanked him. Unfazed, he decided to simply inform then-US president Bill Clinton that he was going, no matter what.",
      "He had an ally in vice-president Al Gore, who intercepted Carter's communication to Clinton. \"[Al Gore] called me on the phone and told me if I would change the wording from \"I've decided to go\" to \"I'm strongly inclined to go\" that he would try to get permission directly from Clinton\u2026 he called me back the next morning and said that I had permission to go.\"",
      "The trip was on.",
      "'Very serious doubts'",
      "On 15 June 1994, Carter crossed over to North Korea, accompanied by his wife Rosalyn, a small group of aides and a TV crew.",
      "Meeting Kim was a moral dilemma for Carter.",
      "\"I had despised Kim Il-sung for 50 years. I was in a submarine in the Pacific during the Korean War, and many of my fellow servicemen were killed in that war, which I thought was precipitated unnecessarily by him,\" he told PBS.",
      "\"And so I had very serious doubts about him. When I arrived, though, he treated me with great deference. He was obviously very grateful that I had come.\"",
      "Over several days, the Carters had meetings with Kim, were taken on a sightseeing tour of Pyongyang and went on a cruise on a luxury yacht owned by Kim's son, Kim Jong-il.",
      "Carter discovered his hunch was right: North Korea not only feared a US military strike on Yongbyon, but was also ready to mobilise.",
      "\"I asked [Kim's advisers] specifically if they had been making plans to go to war. And they responded very specifically, 'Yes, we were',\" he said.",
      "\"North Korea couldn't accept the condemnation of their country and the embarrassment of their leader and that they would respond.",
      "\"And I think this small and self-sacrificial country and the deep religious commitments that you had, in effect, to their revered leader, their Great Leader as they called him, meant that they were willing to make any sacrifice of massive deaths in North Korea in order to preserve their integrity and their honour, which would have been a horrible debacle in my opinion.\"",
      "Carter presented a list of demands from Washington as well as his own suggestions. They included resuming negotiations with the US, starting direct peace talks with South Korea, a mutual withdrawal of military forces, and helping the US find remains of US soldiers buried in North Korean territory.",
      "\"He agreed to all of them. And so, I found him to be very accommodating,\" Carter said. \"So far as I know then and now, he was completely truthful with me.\"",
      "Crucially, Carter came up with a deal where North Korea would stop its nuclear activity, allow IAEA inspectors back into its reactors, and eventually dismantle Yongbyon's facilities. In return, the US and its allies would build light-water reactors in North Korea, which could generate nuclear energy but not produce material for weapons.",
      "While enthusiastically embraced by Pyongyang, the deal was met with reluctance from US officials when Carter suggested it in a phone call. He then told them he was going on CNN to announce details of the deal - leaving the Clinton administration little choice but to agree.",
      "Carter would later justify forcing his own government's hand by saying he had to \"consummate a resolution of what I considered to be a very serious crisis\". But it did not go down well back home - officials were unhappy at Carter's \"freelancing\" and attempt to \"box in\" Clinton, according to Mr Gallucci.",
      "Near the end of the trip, they told him to convey a statement to the North Koreans, reiterating Clinton's public position that the US was continuing to press for UN sanctions. Carter disagreed, according to reports at that time.",
      "Hours later, he got on the boat with Kim, and promptly went off-script. As TV cameras rolled, he told Kim the US had stopped work on drafting UN sanctions - directly contradicting Clinton.",
      "An annoyed White House swiftly disowned Carter. Some openly expressed frustration, painting a picture of a former president going rogue. \"Carter is hearing what he wants to hear\u2026 he is creating his own reality,\" a senior official complained at the time to The Washington Post.",
      "Many in Washington also criticised him for the deal itself, saying the North Koreans had used him.",
      "But Carter's savvy use of the news media to pressure the Clinton administration worked. By broadcasting his negotiations almost instantaneously, he gave the US government little time to react, and immediately after his trip \"it was possible to see an almost hour-by-hour evolution in US policy towards North Korea\" where they ratcheted down their tone, wrote CNN reporter Mike Chinoy who covered Carter's trip.",
      "Though Carter later claimed he had misspoken on the sanctions issue, he also responded with typical stubbornness to the blowback.",
      "\"When I got back to Seoul, I was amazed and distressed at the negative reaction that I had from the White House. They urged me not to come to Washington to give a briefing, urged me to go directly to\u2026 my home,\" he said.",
      "But he went against their wishes.",
      "\"I decided that what I had to offer was too important to ignore.\"",
      "A final dramatic coda to the episode happened a month later.",
      "On 9 July 1994, on the same day as US and North Korean officials sat down in Geneva to talk, state media flashed a stunning announcement: Kim Il-sung had died of a heart attack.",
      "Carter's deal was immediately plunged into uncertainty. But negotiators ploughed through, and weeks later hammered out a formal plan known as the Agreed Framework.",
      "Though the agreement broke down in 2003, it was notable for freezing Pyongyang's nuclear programme for nearly a decade.",
      "'Carter had guts'",
      "Robert Carlin, a former CIA and US state department official who led delegations in negotiations with North Korea, noted that Carter's real achievement was in getting the US government to co-operate.",
      "\"Carter was, more or less, pushing on an open door in North Korea. It was Washington that was the bigger challenge\u2026 if anything, Carter's intervention helped stop the freight train of US decision-making that was hurtling toward a cliff,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Carter's visit was also significant for opening a path for rapprochement, which led to several trips later, including one in 2009 when he travelled with Clinton to bring home captured US journalists.",
      "He is also credited with paving the way for Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un \u2013 Kim Il-sung's grandson - in 2018, as \"Carter made it imaginable\" that a sitting US president could meet with a North Korean leader, Dr Delury said.",
      "That summit failed, and of course, in the long run Carter's trip did not succeed in removing the spectre of nuclear war, which has only grown - these days North Korea has missiles regarded as capable of hitting the US mainland.",
      "But Carter was lauded for his political gamble. It was in sharp contrast to his time in office, when he was criticised for being too passive on foreign policy, particularly with his handling of the Iran hostage crisis.",
      "His North Korea trip \"was a remarkable example of constructive diplomatic intervention by a former leader,\" Dr Delury said.",
      "His legacy is not without controversy, given the criticism that he took matters in his own hands. His detractors believe he played a risky and complicated game by, as CNN's Mike Chinoy put it, \"seeking to circumvent what he viewed as a mistaken and dangerous US policy by pulling the elements of a nuclear deal together himself\".",
      "But others believe Carter was the right man for the job at the time.",
      "He had \"a very strong will power\", but was also \"a man of peace inside and out,\" said Han S Park, one of several people who helped Carter broker the 1994 trip.",
      "Though his stubbornness also meant that he \"did not get along with a lot of people\", ultimately this combination of attributes meant he was the best person \"to prevent another occurrence of a Korean War\", Prof Park said.",
      "More than anything, Carter was convinced he was doing the right thing.",
      "\"He didn't let US government clucking and handwringing stop him,\" says Robert Carlin. \"Carter had guts.\""

      "Granted the chance to speak ahead of his sentencing, Trump railed against the case for several minutes.",
      "\"This has been a very terrible experience,\" he said.",
      "He claimed there had been a \"weaponisation\" of the judicial system and claimed the case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for political reasons.",
      "\"I would like to explain that I was treated very, very unfairly, and I thank you very much,\" he said, before falling silent.",
      "As Bragg watched Trump address him directly for the first time, he maintained a mostly stoic expression. He did, however, chuckle when Trump claimed Bragg had never wanted to bring the case.",
      "After Trump had his say, Justice Merchan then took several moments to reflect on the \"paradox\" of the trial.",
      "Justice Merchan noted that despite the media and political circus outside, \"once the courtroom doors were closed, it was no more unique than all the other cases taking place at the same time\".",
      "But he added that after Trump was convicted, the case took another turn when the American people elected him in November to a second presidential term.",
      "After careful consideration, he had determined that \"the only lawful sentence, without encroaching upon the highest office of the land\", was unconditional discharge - a sentence that would allow the American people a president unencumbered by pending court proceedings.",
      "The end of a historic trial",
      "Trump was found guilty by a New York jury of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May 2024. His sentencing was delayed multiple times due to Supreme Court rulings and the November presidential election.",
      "The charges stemmed from a plot to cover up a hush-money payment to an adult film star in the waning days of the 2016 election. Prosecutors argued the payment was a form of election interference aimed at keeping vital information from voters, and therefore broke the law.",
      "In October 2016, Trump's then-attorney, Michael Cohen, paid a woman named Stormy Daniels $130,000 (\u00a3106,000) to remain silent about a years-old alleged sexual encounter with the soon-to-be president.",
      "After he was elected, Trump reimbursed Cohen in installments \u2013 and then falsely recorded them as legal expenses. Each of Trump's guilty verdicts correlates to a false document related to the cover-up.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and denied the sexual encounter with Ms Daniels. He repeatedly claimed the case was politically motivated persecution.",
      "The six-week trial became a legal, political and media firestorm. Larger-than-life characters like Cohen and Daniels took the stand to face questioning from Trump's attorneys.",
      "Trump brought a string of family members and Republican allies to court with him each day to fill the benches behind his defence table. Each day, he turned a small media pen in the hallway outside the courtroom into his personal pulpit, using the opportunities to rail against the justice system, the press, and other adversaries.",
      "Trump also used the furore of the trial to raise millions from supporters for his legal battles, and his campaign to retake the White House.",
      "In the four years between his terms in office, Trump was indicted in four separate criminal cases, including his New York case. In the end, this was the only one to go to trial.",
      "On the campaign trail and social media, Trump used his legal quagmires to portray himself \u2013 and his supporters \u2013 as victims of a rigged justice system.",
      "Despite the multiple indictments, including two that centred on his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Trump decisively defeated Vice-President Kamala Harris in November.",
      "His victory quashed the two federal prosecutions against him, including his federal election interference case and one involving alleged mishandling of classified documents. The third, an election interference case in Fulton County, Georgia, has been stuck in a series of delays and side dramas for months.",

      "But, he added, the government had \"no ambition whatsoever to escalate some war of words.\"",
      "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed Trump's own suggestion that the US might use military force to seize Greenland. \"I don't have the fantasy to imagine that it'll ever get to that,\" she told Danish TV.",
      "And Lars Sandahl Sorensen, CEO of Danish Industry, also said there was \"every reason to stay calm... no-one has any interest in a trade war.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hastily organised high-level meetings have been taking place in Copenhagen all week, a reflection of the shock caused by Trump's remarks.",
      "Greenland PM Mute Egede flew in to meet both the prime minister and King Frederik X on Wednesday.",
      "And on Thursday night, party leaders from across the political spectrum gathered for an extraordinary meeting on the crisis with Mette Frederiksen in Denmark's parliament.",
      "Faced with what many in Denmark are calling Trump's \"provocation,\" Frederiksen has broadly attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, repeatedly referring to the US as \"Denmark's closest partner\".",
      "It was \"only natural\" that the US was preoccupied by the Arctic and Greenland, she added.",
      "Yet she also said that any decision on Greenland's future should be up to its people alone: \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders... and it's the Greenlanders themselves who have to define their future.\"",
      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Russia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland",
      "Ros Atkins: Why is Trump threatening to annex Greenland?",
      "Her cautious approach is twofold.",
      "On the one hand, Frederiksen is keen to avoid escalating the situation. She's been burned before, in 2019, when Trump cancelled a trip to Denmark after she said his proposal to buy Greenland was \"absurd\".",
      "\"Back then he only had one more year in office, then things went back to normal,\"  veteran political journalist Erik Holstein told the BBC . \"But maybe this is the new normal.\"",
      "But Frederiksen's comments also speak to the Danish resolve not to meddle in the internal affairs of Greenland \u2013 an autonomous territory with its own parliament and whose population is increasingly leaning towards independence.",
      "\"She should've been much clearer in rejecting the idea,\" said opposition MP Rasmus Jarlov.",
      "\"This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting,\" he told the BBC, although he admitted Trump's forcefulness had \"surprised everybody.\"",
      "The conservative MP believed Frederiksen's insistence that \"only Greenland... can decide and define Greenland's future\" placed too much pressure on the island's inhabitants. \"It would've been prudent and clever to stand behind Greenland and just clearly state that Denmark doesn't want [a US takeover].\"",
      "The Greenland question is a delicate one for Denmark, whose prime minister officially apologised only recently for spearheading a 1950s social experiment which saw Inuit children removed from their families to be re-educated as \"model Danes\".",
      "Last week, Greenland's leader said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism.\"",
      "By doing so he tapped into growing nationalist sentiment, fuelled by interest among Greenland's younger generations in the indigenous culture and history of the Inuit.",
      "Most commentators now expect a successful independence referendum in the near future. While for many it would be seen as a victory, it could also usher in a new set of problems, as 60% of Greenland's economy is dependent on Denmark.",
      "An independent Greenland \"would need to make choices,\" said Karsten Honge. The Green Left MP now fears his preferred option of a new Commonwealth-style pact \"based on equality and democracy\" is unlikely to come about.",
      "Sitting in his parliamentary office decorated with poems and drawings depicting scenes of Inuit life, Honge said Greenland would need to decide \"how much it values independence\". It could sever ties with Denmark and turn to the US, Honge said, \"but if you treasure independence then that doesn't make sense.\"",
      "Opposition MP Jarlov argues that while there is no point in forcing Greenland to be part of Denmark, \"it is very close to being an independent country already\".",
      "Its capital Nuuk is self-governed, but relies on Copenhagen for management of currency, foreign relations and defence - as well as substantial subsidies.",
      "\"Greenland today has more independence than Denmark has from the EU,\" Jarlov added. \"So I hope they think things through.\"",
      "As Mette Frederiksen has the awkward task of responding firmly while not offending Greenland or the US, the staunchest rebuttal to Trump's comments so far has come from outside Denmark.",
      "The principle of the inviolability of borders \"applies to every country... no matter whether it's a very small one or a very powerful one,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned, while French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the EU would not let other nations \"attack its sovereign borders\".",
      "Their comments gave away the deep concern within the EU about how to handle the upcoming Trump presidency. \"This is not just very serious for Greenland and Denmark \u2013 it is serious to the whole world and to Europe as a whole,\" MP Karsten Honge said.",
      "\"Imagine a world \u2013 which we may be facing in just a few weeks \u2013 where international agreements don't exist. That would shake everything up, and Denmark would just be a small part of it.\"",
      "The Danish trade sector has similarly been engulfed by deep nervousness after Trump said he would \"tariff Denmark at a very high level\" if it refused to give up Greenland to the US.",
      "A 2024 Danish Industry study showed that Denmark's GDP would fall by three points if the US imposed 10% tariffs on imports from the EU to the US as part of a global trade war.",
      "Singling out Danish products from the influx of EU goods would be near-impossible for the US, and would almost certainly result in retaliatory measures from the EU. But trade industry professionals are taking few chances, and in Denmark as elsewhere on the continent huge amounts of resources are being spent internally to plan for potential outcomes of Donald Trump's second term in the White House.",
      "As his inauguration approaches, Danes are preparing as they can to weather the storm. There is guarded hope that the president-elect could soon shift his focus to grievances towards other EU partners, and that the Greenland question could be temporarily shelved.",
      "But the disquiet brought on by Trump's refusal to rule out military intervention to seize Greenland remains.",
      "Karsten Honge said Denmark would have to suffer whatever decision the US takes.",
      "\"They just need to send a small battleship to travel down the Greenland coast and send a polite letter to Denmark,\" he said, only partly in jest.",
      "\"The last sentence would be: well, Denmark, what you gonna do about it?",
      "\"That's the new reality with regards to Trump.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza could be substantially higher than official figures reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests.",
      "The UK-led study covered the first nine months of the war, which began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.",
      "It used data from the ministry, an online survey of relatives reporting fatalities, and obituaries. It estimated that up until 30 June 2024, 64,260 Palestinians died from traumatic injury, meaning an under-reporting of deaths by 41%.",
      "The Israeli embassy in the UK said \"any information that derives from Gaza cannot be trusted\" and served Hamas.",
      "The UN treats the health ministry's figures as reliable.",
      "The ministry's figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but a recent report by the UN said the majority of verified victims over a six month period were women and children.",
      "Israel says Hamas's figures cannot be trusted. In August, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had \"eliminated over 17,000 terrorists\", though it is unclear how it arrived at this figure. The IDF insists it only targets combatants and tries to avoid or minimise civilian casualties.",
      "Israel is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it difficult to verify the facts on the ground.",
      "The team behind the latest study used a statistical method called \"capture-recapture\", a technique which has been used to evaluate deaths in other conflicts.",
      "Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine looked at how many people turned up repeatedly in different attempts to count deaths. The level of overlap between those lists suggested that the number of deaths directly caused by traumatic injury in the conflict could be significantly higher than hospital figures published by the Ministry of Health.",
      "Gaza's health ministry issues updated death tolls from the war daily. It compiles the figures from deaths recorded in hospitals, deaths reported by family members, and deaths from \"reliable media reports\".",
      "The report in The Lancet estimated a death toll between 55,298\u201378,525 people, compared to 37,877 reported by the health ministry.",
      "The report's figures could be meaningfully higher or lower depending on the technical details of the analysis.",
      "For example, identifying deaths by \"traumatic injury\" in each set of data could be tricky. Getting it wrong could push the study's estimates higher or lower.",
      "The research also said 59% of those killed for whom data on sex and age was available were women, children and the elderly.",
      "The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's attack in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military offensive on Gaza in response.",

      "The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a law that bans TikTok in the US over national security concerns unless its China-based parent company sells the platform ahead of a 19 January deadline.",
      "The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a  violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US.",

      "Congress passed the law with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties - a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people.",
      "The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.",
      "TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
      "Noel Francisco, a former US solicitor general appearing for the platform, stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship.",

      "\"It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,\" she said, comparing the situation to \"game of chicken\" and one in which the US should not \"blink first\".",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 01:12:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Meet the woman who has found an innovative way to simply accessing much-needed aid in war-torn Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Last autumn Hania Zataari, a mechanical engineer who works for Lebanon's Ministry of Industry put her skills to use as war in the country raged on. Hailing from Sidon, South Lebanon, she created a chatbot on WhatsApp that simplified access to much-needed aid.",
      "\"They lost their houses, their savings, their work, everything they had built,\" Hania says, referring to those forced from their homes by war.",
      "On 23 September, Israel dramatically escalated its offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it had been fighting a spiralling conflict since Hezbollah attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "According to the Lebanese government, at least 492 people were killed in one of Lebanon's deadliest days of conflict in almost 20 years.",
      "Thousands of families fled to Sidon after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) hit what it said was 1,600 Hezbollah strongholds inside Lebanon.",
      "Hania says many displaced people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings, but many others who fled their homes were forced to rent elsewhere or stay with members of their family.",
      "It is these people who weren't directly receiving support from the government that she wanted to help. Drawing on her programming skills, Hania created the \"aidbot\" to narrow the gap between the demand and supply of aid.",
      "The aidbot is a chatbot - a type of AI system designed to communicate with its users online - that links to WhatsApp. It is programmed to ask simple questions about the types of aid people require along with their names and locations.",
      "This information is then recorded onto a Google spreadsheet which Hania and her team of unpaid volunteers, made up of friends and family, access to distribute aid such as food, blankets, mattresses, medicine and clothes.",
      "Hania used her spare time to build the bot using the website Callbell.eu, which is commonly used by businesses to engage with customers on Meta's platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook messenger.",
      "She explains that the bot, which is still being used today, makes distributing aid more efficient as it cuts down the amount of time she spends responding to requests for aid over WhatsApp.",
      "\"I'm not really interested in knowing their names. I just need to know where they are so I can manage the delivery,\" she says.",
      "Take, for example, a request for baby formula. Hania says the bot will ask for the age of the baby and the quantity needed so that she and her team can provide it.",
      "The project, she says, is funded by donations coming from Lebanese people living abroad. She's created a publicly available dashboard to record what the project has spent money on and how much aid she and her team have distributed.",
      "At the time of writing they have delivered 78 food parcels to families of 5 or 10 people, 900 mattresses, and 323 blankets across Sidon and other parts of Lebanon.",
      "Last October, 47 year-old Khaldoun Abbas and his family fled their homes in Najjarieh after they received calls from the IDF urging them to leave for their own safety.",
      "Seventeen people, ranging in age from nine to 78, slept under one roof in a rented three bed apartment in Sidon.",
      "Khaldoun says he, his wife and their children, as well as his brother's family slept on mattresses they requested using the aidbot in the hallway of the flat. They also requested blankets, food and cleaning detergents.",
      "Unlike his neighbours, he's not been able to return to his home. It was destroyed in a confirmed Israeli strike 11 days later. The IDF told the BBC it \"struck a terror infrastructure\".",
      "When we put this allegation to Khaldoun, he denied having any connection to Hezbollah or any other party.",
      "What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?",
      "Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon",
      "Lebanon's financial crisis explained",
      "\"This isn't the first time Sidon has opened its doors to displaced people,\" Hania explains, referring to the wave of people who have arrived in the city.",
      "Sidon has a long-standing reputation for taking in internally displaced people driven from their homes along the Lebanon-Israel border.",
      "The most recent conflict began in October 2023 after the war between Israel and Hamas spilled over into Lebanon when Hezbollah, Hamas' ally, fired rockets into Israel in support of Gaza.",
      "The Lebanese healthy ministry says nearly 4,000 people have been killed and over a million have been displaced. The ministry does not say how many of these are civilians or combatants.",
      "In Israel around 60,000 people have been evacuated from Northern Israel and authorities say more than 80 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed.",
      "Last November a ceasefire was agreed between Israel and Lebanon. Despite some skirmishes it has largely been upheld. But people on the ground say the provision of aid has not improved.",
      "International NGO Islamic Relief told the BBC that the \"conflict, destruction, and evacuation orders have fuelled ongoing displacement in Lebanon which has made it difficult to assess and address the needs of the population amid the changing situation.\"",
      "But it is not just the war that is hindering aid distribution.",
      "Bilal Merie, a volunteer working with Hania says many of the problems they face are due to the \"high demand but short supply\" of aid.",
      "He puts it down to the deep economic turmoil that has gripped the country since 2019, meaning the Lebanese government has had to rely heavily on funding from creditors and aid organisations for goods.",
      "But even NGOs are feeling the crunch. Unicef Lebanon says that with only 20% of the funding they need, it \"continues to face an enormous funding gap,\" meaning the charity is unable to support families when they need it most.",
      "In a country overrun with financial woes and by war, could this aidbot make a tangible difference?",
      "It is the first time researcher John Bryant from the think tank Overseas Development Institute has heard of a chatbot being used in such a way in the humanitarian sector.",
      "He says the cultural context in which it is being used is commendable. That is, with knowledge of \"the channels people are using to talk to each other and meeting them in their own language\".",
      "However he is unsure of its scalability, as what works in Lebanon cannot easily be replicated in other parts of the world.",
      "\"What tech offers a lot of the time is a standard cookie cutter approach.",
      "\"It's the local designers, the local translators, the trusted human interlocutors and elements within that system that elevate digital tools into something useful,\" he says.",
      "The aidbot might not be able to offer the solution to all Lebanon's problems, but to the families using it, it has made life a little easier.",

    "summary": "Dr Angela Tabiri wants more African girls and women from less privileged backgrounds to study maths.",
    "story": [
      "Known in Ghana as the Maths Queen, Dr Angela Tabiri is the first African to win The Big Internet Math Off competition - quite an achievement for someone who had not initially planned to study mathematics.",
      "The 35-year-old Ghanaian \"finds joy in solving puzzles and mathematical questions\" and hopes her 2024 win will open up the world of mathematics to other African women - who have traditionally been discouraged from taking the subject.",
      "Sixteen mathematicians were invited to compete for the tongue-in-cheek title of \"the world's most interesting mathematician\" - a public vote event started in 2018 by The Aperiodical blog.",
      "The first winner was Dr Nira Chamberlain, the first black mathematician to be included in the British reference book Who's Who and a vice-president of the professional body, the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.",
      "During the event they all compete against each other - so two in each match - and then it goes to quarter-finals and semi-finals until the big match to decide who has explained their chosen mathematical concept in the most illuminating way.",
      "Dr Tabiri's passion is quantum, or non-commutative, algebra, which she researches at the Ghana branch of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Aims).",
      "Aims started in South Africa and then expanded to Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon and Rwanda - to provide post-graduate training and research in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
      "Dr Tabiri is also the academic manager for the Girls in Mathematical Sciences Programme, a mentoring and support scheme for high or secondary school girls in Ghana.",
      "It was set up by Aims-Ghana in 2020 to \"ensure that we have a pipeline of young girls who will be leading in research and innovation in the mathematical sciences - in academia and also industry\".",
      "Dr Tabiri says the numbers of girls and boys studying maths at high school is roughly equal but then drops off at university level.",
      "This is partly because, she says, female students assume is that if they do maths, the only job they can do is teach, because maths is still seen as a \"boy's subject\" - and there are very few female role models.",
      "This is something Dr Tabiri is trying to change.",
      "But her journey into maths was not straightforward.",
      "She grew up in Ashaiman, one of the poorer, densely populated neighbourhoods of Tema, an industrial hub and port an hour's drive east of the capital, Accra.",
      "Her family home was happy but noisy - she has four sisters - and Dr Tabiri would often seek out the peace and quiet of the local youth community centre so that she could study.",
      "She wanted to follow in the footsteps of two sisters and study business administration at university.",
      "But her grades, although high, were not high enough - and so she was accepted instead for mathematics and economics.",
      "\"It was a blessing in disguise,\" Dr Tabiri says. \"Numbers and puzzles fascinated me - but I never thought a career in maths was for me.\"",
      "In 2015, Dr Tabiri got a scholarship to do her PhD at Glasgow University in Scotland. It was hard work, she says - and it was there that she experienced a seminal moment.",
      "She went to see Hidden Figures, the film about black American women mathematicians who worked at the US space agency, Nasa, in the 1950s, during the era of segregation in the US.",
      "\"It was amazing seeing the story of these black women told on that global stage,\" she remembers. \"I had a lot of goose bumps watching it.\"",
      "She was particularly inspired by Katherine Johnson, whose extraordinary mathematical skills and calculations were so crucial to the success of US space flights.",
      "\"Katherine Johnson worked so hard - and for a long time her work was hidden. She made me realise that I just have to keep going.",
      "\"If your work is not even recognised now, it will be recognised sometime in future. It was a real turning-point for me.\"",
      "Ghana reached an historic milestone in 2024 when Dr Gloria Botchway became the first woman to graduate from the University of Ghana with a PhD in maths.",
      "It was a journey full of hardships - including selling water and yams at the roadside as a six-year-old.",
      "Dr Tabiri is trying to support other African girls and women from less privileged backgrounds to follow their maths dreams through her FemAfricMaths non-profit organisation.",
      "Along with other volunteers, she gives lessons to the youngest high-school students in person and online.",
      "She also posts on social media interviews she does with leading female mathematicians from all over the world.",
      "Dr Tabiri is also hugely passionate about the potential of quantum science and technology - for which mathematics is essential.",
      "She is proud that Ghana, backed by Mexico, spearheaded proposals that 2025 be declared the UN International Year of Quantum Science and Technology - on the 100th anniversary of the discovery of modern quantum mechanics.",
      "Quantum mechanics emerged from studies to uncover how ultra-tiny particles - the most fundamental bits of matter, energy and light - interact with each other to make up the world.",
      "It led to the development of the internet, solar cells, and global navigation satellite systems.",
      "Researchers and big tech companies from across the world - including China, the US, the UK, Australia and South Africa - are now racing to develop quantum technologies, including quantum computers and ultra-precising measuring and sensor devices.",
      "The hope is that complex problems will be solved at lightning speeds - and there will be huge innovations in areas like medicine, environmental sciences, food production and cyber-security.",
      "\"There are lots of conversations now - the advantages and disadvantages - the jobs that will be created,\" says Dr Tabiri.",
      "Africa's fast-growing population, already the youngest in the world, will be the world's largest workforce by 2040, according to the UN.",
      "\"But that doesn't mean that we will get the jobs,\" says Dr Tabiri.",
      "She hopes to organise a \"quantum road show\" as a first step in introducing schoolchildren to quantum science at a much earlier age that she was.",
      "\"We want young people to start developing an interest in and building all the relevant skills during their basic schooling,\" she says.",
      "The road show will be based on a recent quantum computing course she held for secondary-school girls who attend classes at Aims-Ghana during their holidays.",
      "The course discussed what it takes to build a quantum computer, its current fragilities - and the challenges quantum computing poses to current systems, such as cryptography.",
      "Working with Unesco, Dr Tabiri will also host a week-long \"Quantum Hackathon\" in July at Aims-Ghana for about 40 post-graduate students from different African countries.",
      "\"We want them to use their quantum skills to solve some of the greatest challenges that we face, real-life problems,\" says Dr Tabiri.",
      "\"It's very urgent that we position our youth for this next big revolution.\"",

    "summary": "India\u2019s six losses in eight Tests raise doubts over Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and their red-ball future.",
    "story": [
      "Indian cricket fans are still reeling from the team's crushing 1-3 defeat in the five-match Test series against Australia.",
      "Once dominant in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with historic victories over the mighty Australians over the past decade, the tourists fell short, exposing vulnerabilities in a side long thought invincible.",
      "The series highlighted glaring issues - Indian batters struggled, and Jasprit Bumrah was the lone bowler to trouble Australia.",
      "The loss not only cost India the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also denied them a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, breaking their streak of back-to-back appearances in 2021 and 2023, where they lost to New Zealand and Australia respectively.",
      "India's recent form is troubling - they have lost six of their last eight Tests, including a shocking 0-3 home whitewash against New Zealand.",
      "The defeats have raised questions about the team's depth, the future of key players like captain Rohit Sharma and former skipper Virat Kohli, and their ability to rebuild.",
      "With a team in transition and stalwarts fading, Indian Test cricket faces pressing challenges to sustain its legacy in a rapidly evolving landscape.",
      "India's next red-ball challenge is a five-Test series in England starting July. England's conditions, known for dramatic shifts even within a session, will test players' technique, skills and adaptability to the limit.",
      "India hasn't won a series in England since 2007, with only two prior victories (1971, 1986), highlighting the daunting task ahead. Adding to the pressure, recent failures against New Zealand and Australia leave selectors grappling with tough decisions on player selection and team combinations for this critical campaign.",
      "The biggest headache for selectors is the form of batting stalwarts Sharma and Kohli after dismal outings in Australia and earlier against New Zealand.",
      "Sharma managed just 31 runs in three Tests in Australia, with his poor form seeing him dropping himself for the final game. Kohli fared slightly better with 190 runs in nine innings, but 100 runs of his total came in one knock. His dismissals followed a pattern - caught in the slips or behind the stumps - pointing to a glaring technical flaw or mental fatigue under pressure.",
      "Since January 2024, Sharma has managed just 619 runs in 16 Tests with one century. Kohli's numbers are worse over time - averaging 32 in Tests since 2020 with only two centuries.",
      "Once a late-blooming Test opener and blazing match-winner, Sharma now struggles to find his ideal batting position. Meanwhile, Kohli's surreal decline - after a decade of dominance and swagger- has left cricket's former titan in an extended slump.",
      "From Sunil Gavaskar to Sachin Tendulkar to Kohli, the baton of Indian batting greatness has passed seamlessly. But a worthy successor to Kohli remains elusive.",
      "KL Rahul has the class but lacks the hunger for consistent big scores. Rishabh Pant is a thrilling maverick, equally capable of winning or losing a match. Shubman Gill, touted as the next Big Thing, has struggled overseas despite his undeniable pedigree and needs careful nurturing.",
      "Punjab's young left-hander Abhishek Sharma, mentored by Yuvraj Singh, is highly rated, while Nitish Kumar Reddy impressed on debut in Australia with his fearless performances in tough situations.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's top Test run-scorer in Australia this series, has been the standout among young batsmen. With panache, patience, technical assurance, and explosive strokes, he looks poised to become Kohli's successor as the team's talisman.",
      "India's talent pool is brimming across departments. Jasprit Bumrah, with his 32-wicket haul against Australia, has cemented his status as a fast-bowling colossus. Backed by Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, and a dozen promising quicks, India boasts a formidable pace arsenal for all formats.",
      "That said, Bumrah is a once-in-a-generation talent and needs careful workload management. Overburdening him, as in the Australia series, risks breakdowns that could impede the attack. Shami, after lengthy stints in rehab, also requires careful handling. Together, they form one of modern cricket's most formidable pace pairs.",
      "With Ravichandran Ashwin's sudden retirement and Ravindra Jadeja's lukewarm showing in Australia, India's spin depth looks thin. However, Washington Sundar has shown promise on home pitches, while young spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Tanush Kotian, who joined the squad mid-series in Australia, are knocking on the doors of Test cricket.",
      "Smarting from recent losses to New Zealand and Australia, the Indian cricket board  is moving swiftly to usher in a transition. Selectors have been directed to shortlist potential Test players from the second round of the domestic Ranji Trophy, resuming 23 January.",
      "All players, including Sharma and Kohli, are likely to be asked to play domestic cricket - a move that could help them regain form.",
      "Managing a team in transition poses complex challenges requiring patience, empathy, and clear vision. Knee-jerk reactions or external pressure could worsen the situation instead of providing solutions.",
      "Whether Sharma and Kohli can overcome their crisis remains to be seen, but India's wealth of talent should lift the current gloom surrounding Indian cricket.",
      "It's worth recalling that in 2011, after winning the ODI World Cup, India was whitewashed 4-0 in Test series against England and Australia. Cricket seemed to hit rock bottom.",
      "But, within months, a revival led by young talents like Kohli, Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Jadeja, Ashwin, and others saw India rise to become the world's top team across formats, holding that position for nearly a decade."

    "story": [
      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "Brooke Shields has written two New York Times bestsellers that recount a life lived in the public eye, and of the challenges faced in private, whether it be post-partum depression or the loss of her mother. In her latest, \"Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old: Thoughts on Aging as a Woman\"\u00a0(\u200eto be published January 14 by Flatiron Books), the model, actress and entrepreneur writes about the wrinkles that come with society's expectations of women as they reach or surpass \"a certain age.\"",
      "Shields, who will turn 60 in May, says that external perceptions don't match up with her internal sense of self, and that later years are something \"to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive.\" She also notes how society's ignorance of the power (not to mention the purchasing power) of women middle-aged and older is short-sighted at best.",
      "Read the book's introduction below, and don't miss Faith Salie's interview with Brooke Shields on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 12!",
      "\"Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old\"",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

    "story": [
      "\"Inside Edition\" correspondent Alison Hall is opening up about her breast cancer journey and how actress Olivia Munn's own cancer diagnosis influenced Hall's decision to seek testing. Hall shared her story on \"CBS Mornings,\" explaining how Munn's advocacy for early detection, along with a breast cancer risk assessment tool, led to her life-saving diagnosis.",
      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",
      "\"Wow, OK, that feels high,\" Hall said, after hearing the news.",
      "Hall, whose mother had breast cancer at age 50, had already undergone genetic testing for the BRCA gene in her 20s, which came back negative. She also had never had a mammogram until this year, after taking the risk assessment test.",
      "Following the assessment, Hall was placed on a regular screening schedule, including mammograms and MRIs every six months. After an MRI revealed some abnormalities, Hall underwent biopsies, which confirmed she had breast cancer.",
      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",
      "Hall has chosen to undergo a double mastectomy next week to remove the current cancer and lower her risk of future diagnoses.",
      "\"I want to do whatever I can to prevent that for my future self and my future family,\" Hall said.",
      "Munn sent \"CBS Mornings\" a statement to deliver to Hall, saying, \"You are now on the path to survival ... By telling your story, you are creating a ripple effect of hope and saving lives.\"",
      "Hall expressed deep gratitude for Munn's words and emphasized how sharing her story could help others.",
      "\"By Olivia sharing her story, she had a direct impact on my life,\" Hall said.",
      "As Hall prepares for her upcoming surgery, she is grateful for the support of her family and friends, including her husband, whom she calls her \"human support person.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",
      "In addition to his ex-wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.",

      "Former \"Today\" anchor Meredith Vieira's husband, Richard Cohen, died on Christmas Eve, the show's current hosts said Tuesday. He was 76.",
      "Cohen, an Emmy Award-winning journalist who built his career as a producer at both CBS News and CNN, had lived for more than 50 years prior to his death with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. He and Vieira were married for 38 years and share three children: Benjamin Cohen, 36, Gabriel Cohen, 34, and Lily Cohen, 32.",
      "\"Today\" co-anchors Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie announced Cohen's death during Tuesday morning's episode of the NBC series. Kotb said Cohen was \"surrounded by his family and love\" when he died.",

      "Guthrie said Vieira \"was in really good spirits,\" adding that the family recently welcomed a new grandchild.",
      "The hosts shared the news of Cohen's death during a segment that paid tribute to his legacy as a journalist, author and advocate for people living with chronic illnesses. Vieira's husband was vocal about his multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including in one interview with his wife on \"Today\" in 2018, which appeared in the segment.",
      "\"I was diagnosed when I was 25 years old and essentially told there is no hope,\" said Cohen in that 2018 interview. \"Diagnosed and adios. Nothing much we can do.\"",
      "Sharing his health journey and speaking up for others became intertwined with Cohen's work, as his illness was a focal point of his 2004 autobiography, \"Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness: A Reluctant Memoir,\" as well as his later writing. Cohen also survived two bouts of cancer.",
      "Cohen was celebrated on \"Today\" for his sense of humor and remembered as someone who \"lived life to the fullest.\"",
      "What is Multiple Sclerosis?",
      "Multiple sclerosis, often abbreviated M.S., is a chronic autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks itself. It targets the central nervous system and can affect the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, according\u00a0to the the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms of the illness can vary in type and severity, but, as M.S. disrupts communication between the brain and body, it can cause problems like fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, mobility issues and impaired vision. Cohen was legally blind.",
      "What causes M.S. is unknown, and why the disease manifests in some people and not others isn't clear. According to the Mayo Clinic, it's thought that genetics and environmental factors may increase an individual's risk of developing the illness.",
      "It is incurable, but there are treatments. The disease is rarely fatal, and most people diagnosed with it have a normal life expectancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Emily Mae Czachor is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com. She typically covers breaking news, extreme weather and issues involving social and criminal justice. Emily Mae previously wrote for outlets like the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed and Newsweek."

      "The Flowering of Human Consciousness",
      "EVOCATION Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower probably did not survive for long, and \ufb02owers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread \ufb02owering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet\u2014if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.",
      "Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call \ufb02owers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, \ufb02owers were most likely the \ufb01rst thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the \ufb02owers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a \"silent sermon\" once during which he held up a \ufb02ower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.",
      "Seeing beauty in a \ufb02ower could awaken humans, however brie\ufb02y, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The \ufb01rst recognition of beauty was one of the most signi\ufb01cant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, \ufb02owers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more \ufb02eeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word \"enlightenment\" in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon \ufb02owers as the enlightenment of plants.",
      "Any life-form in any realm\u2014mineral, vegetable, animal, or human\u2014can be said to undergo \"enlightenment.\" It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.",
      "What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.",
      "Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didn't become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.",
      "Since time immemorial, \ufb02owers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special signi\ufb01cance for the human spirit. Like all life forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special signi\ufb01cance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and af\ufb01nity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.",
      "Once there is a certain degree of Presence, of still and alert attention in human beings' perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.",
      "In the case of a \ufb02ower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more there than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an af\ufb01nity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form ob- obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life forms. The exception to this are all newborn life forms\u2014babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet \ufb01rmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.",
      "So when you are alert and contemplate a \ufb02ower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three \"en-lightened\" life forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus \ufb02ower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signi\ufb01es the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.",
      "THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK",
      "Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner \ufb02owering so radical and profound that compared to it the \ufb02owering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale re\ufb02ection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of material-ism and materiality and rise above identi\ufb01cation with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to im- imprisonment within their own personality?",
      "The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers\u2014Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known\u2014were humanity's early \ufb02owers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread \ufb02owering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.",
      "Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.",

      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",
      "\"You're a mixologist as well?\"",
      "\"Oh, I can hook it up.\"",
      "\"Okay. What can you not do?\"",
      "\"Keep my mouth shut!\" he laughed. \"I need to learn that one!\"",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 21:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "More than a hundred E. coli cases were linked to contaminated onions produced by Taylor Farms used in McDonald's burgers.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials turned up dozens of violations at a McDonald's supplier linked to a deadly outbreak of E. coli that led to more than a hundred infections and a sweeping recall of onions used in the fast food chain's products, including its Quarter Pounder burgers.",
      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",
      "For restaurants, Taylor Farms\u00a0bills its products\u00a0as a \"prep-less kitchen solution,\" allowing food service workers to skip the usual preparation steps they would need to use with ordinary produce that should be washed and cut before eating.",
      "\"We hold our suppliers to the highest expectations and standards of food safety. Prior to this inspection, and unrelated to its findings, McDonald's stopped sourcing from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility,\" McDonald's said in a statement.",
      "The company pointed to its October announcement\u00a0following the outbreak that it would stop buying onions from Taylor Farms in Colorado \"indefinitely,\" switching suppliers for some 900 restaurants that had relied on the plant.",
      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",
      "The company \"immediately took steps to address\" the issues, the statement said, and added that the FDA classified\u00a0the inspection as not resulting in \"administrative or regulatory action\" against the company.",
      "\"This is consistent with the fact that no illnesses or public health threat has been linked to these observations,\" Taylor Farms said.",
      "Taylor Farms ultimately recalled thousands of cases of ready-to-eat onions that it had distributed to food service facilities in six states following the outbreak.",
      "At least 104 cases of E. coli infections were linked to the outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including 34 hospitalizations and one death.",
      "\"Should have been marked as a 'fail'\"",
      "FDA inspectors said they discovered \"numerous equipment with apparent biofilm and large amounts of food debris\" around the Taylor Farms facility in Colorado Springs, even after workers had supposedly completed their required cleaning procedures.",
      "The FDA said that Taylor Farms quality control officials had signed off on cleaning at the facility as passing, even when agency inspectors said they could still see \"several food contact surfaces that were not visually clean and should have been marked as a 'Fail'.\"",
      "Food debris building up on the company's equipment was so bad that it was leading to cross-contamination, the FDA's inspectors worried. A company that had been buying green peppers from Taylor Farms complained that onions had found their way into their ready-to-eat product.",
      "Workers were also cutting corners on required sanitation steps for themselves, the FDA's inspectors alleged.",
      "Staff at the McDonald's supplier only \"sometimes\" used hand sanitizer when handling food that was supposed to be ready-to-eat or \"RTE,\" as the industry calls it, on their gloved hands.",
      "\"Production employees handling RTE produce and food contact surfaces were not observed using any of the handwashing sinks in the facility,\" the FDA's inspectors wrote.",
      "\"Equipment is constantly wet\"",
      "The FDA's inspectors also discovered Taylor Farms was frequently skipping the drying step after dunking tools into a solution of sanitizing chemicals, which inspectors feared was resulting in the solution being \"directly applied\" to ready-to-eat produce.",
      "\"Equipment is constantly wet due to the wet processing environment and cold temperatures,\" agency inspectors wrote.",
      "Instructions from the manufacturer of the cleaning solution urged users to air-dry sanitized utensils, the FDA said.",
      "FDA officials also worried about how staff were cooking up the cleaning chemical mixtures that they were using.",
      "Some solutions tested above the maximum concentration of chemicals that were allowed, while the company wasn't sure how it came up for the recipe of another cleaning concoction it was using that FDA inspectors questioned.",
      "\"Management could not provide a manufacturer label and/or manufacturers/chemical representatives claiming that mixing these chemicals listed above was designed for this use,\" inspectors said.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",

      "India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for the first time setting guidelines for levels of lead in processed baby foods such as jarred fruits and vegetables.",
      "Part of an effort to reduce exposure to a toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological issues in children, the action announced on Monday offers only voluntary \u2014 not mandatory \u2014 limits for food manufacturers. But the agency can take enforcement action if it finds foods that surpass its recommended limits.",
      "The FDA guidance caps lead levels for children younger than 2 at 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings, and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals.",
      "The directive covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes. By contrast, the new limits don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, despite some research indicating the products have higher levels of lead. It also doesn't limit other metals like cadmium that have been found in baby foods.",
      "\"FDA's actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,\" said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"However, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards.\"",

The amount of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum allowable limit.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 18:14:17 -0500",
    "summary": "About 1,600 policies for Pacific Palisades homeowners were dropped by State Farm in July, the state insurance office says.",
    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California whose district includes parts of Los Angeles, told CBS MoneyWatch she will soon re-introduce a bill called the Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act, which would require the Government Accountability Office to analyze the dangers posed by wildfires to communities, and how insurance companies are responding.",
      "\"It will help us determine what the best federal response is to these issues,\" Waters said. \"We have to know more about climate change,\" such as determining which areas or types of vegetation are more susceptible to wildfires, and the risk of building in those areas.",
      "She added that the higher risks are \"leaving homeowners and business owners and families without insurance coverage because some of the insurance companies are canceling; they are aren't writing any new insurance. People continue to pay higher prices for even less coverage.\"",
      "With the fires continuing to rage across the Los Angeles area, the estimated cost of the disaster is surging. The potential property damage and economic losses could amount to as much as $150 billion, according to a Thursday estimate from AccuWeather. That would make these wildfires by far the most destructive in U.S. history.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

      "Under the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, the economy has cooled, dampening inflation but also creating some cracks in the labor market. At the same time, the incoming Trump administration's policies, if enacted, are expected to be inflationary, prompting some economists to predict that the central bank may hold off on cutting rates at its January 29 meeting.",
      "Fewer Fed cuts?",
      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",

John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",

For those looking to be treated fairly and paid for damage and destruction to their property, speaking up and doing advance research is crucial, experts and consumer advocates say.",
      "The good news? Unlike with\u00a0flooding, a standard homeowners' policy covers destruction and damage caused by fire, including wildfires, and a\u00a0standard renters' insurance policy covers the renter's personal belongings, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "The optional comprehensive part of a standard auto insurance policy covers vehicles against damage caused by fire and falling objects. Approximately 75% of U.S. drivers opt to buy it.",

      "Triple-I advises the following\u00a0steps to begin filing a claim:",
      "Contact your insurance carrier or agent as soon as possible to begin the claim-filing process, and make sure to ask about requirements and deadlines. Many insurers have a mobile app where you can file a claim.",
      "Take photos of damaged items (if it is safe to do so) and don't discard damaged items until your assigned insurance adjuster has completed their assessment.",
      "Keep all receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, such as temporary lodging.",
      "Things to know and watch out for",
      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured.

Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",

      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",

If your home is not damaged and your temporary living expenses are modest, keep in mind that filing a claim goes on your record and can hike your insurance costs.",

    "summary": "After reaching a tentative deal that suspended a short strike in October, unionized dockworkers and port operators face another crucial test.",
    "story": [
      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",
      "While that strike ended after three days with a tentative deal between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) that addressed some key issues, the sides face a January 15 deadline to resolve other concerns.",
      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",
      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "summary": "Millions of taxpayers continue to struggle with delays in refunds from the IRS, a new tax advocate report says.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans continue to grapple with IRS delays that are preventing them from getting their tax refunds in a timely manner, according to a new report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent watchdog that's part of the IRS.",
      "The report, published annually to highlight the IRS' most glaring problems, comes after the agency was given billions in new funding through the Inflation Reduction Act to improve its technology and go after wealthy tax cheats. Yet for many taxpayers, dealing with the IRS involves \"delays, frustration and unnecessary costs,\" the taxpayer advocate, Erin M. Collins, wrote in the report.",
      "Problems highlighted in the report echo issues that bedeviled millions of taxpayers during the pandemic, when the IRS shuttered its offices, causing many returns to get caught in a bottleneck, delaying refunds. While the worst of those issues have since been resolved, Collins noted, the IRS continues to struggle in some areas, such as processing paper returns and dealing with taxpayers who have been victims of identity theft, which can lead to lengthy refund delays.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the improvements I have described, taxpayers continue to face challenges in their dealings with the IRS,\" she wrote.",
      "The nearly $80 billion in funding from the IRA has helped the tax agency hire more workers, some of whom have bulked up its customer service support. But almost $6 out of every $10 of the new funding is directed toward enforcement, or boosting audits of wealthy tax cheats and businesses that skirt tax laws, the report noted.",
      "\"I have previously criticized this extreme imbalance in funding priorities,\" Collins wrote in the report, noting that she believes more money should be directed toward taxpayer services, an IRS unit that helps taxpayers with questions, problems and other dilemmas that arise.",
      "The IRS has already made improvements in some of the areas underscored by Collins, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTA report also acknowledges the progress the IRS has made, which Werfel said demonstrates \"what a well-funded IRS can do.\"",
      "\"It's important to continue that momentum because we recognize the agency's work isn't done \u2014not by a long shot,\" he said. \"It's vital that the IRS continue this progress to better serve taxpayers and the nation.\"",
      "Here's who is facing tax refund delays",
      "Collins reiterated one of her earlier\u00a0criticisms\u00a0of the IRS: That paper returns are the agency's \"kryptonite.\" Unfortunately, she said in her most recent return, the IRS continues to receive more than 10 million income tax returns on paper each year \u2014 while it also gets another 75 million paper forms from taxpayers.",
      "While the IRS has made progress in processing paper returns, it's still not up to snuff, she noted. Processing paper returns can still take months for the IRS to complete, she added.",
      "And many people who e-file also face delays if their 1040s are rejected, an issue that impacted 18 million taxpayers in fiscal year 2024, or 12% percent of returns, her report noted. These rejections can happen for issues like a PIN that doesn't match the prior year's return, or an adjusted gross income number that doesn't match up from the prior year.",
      "\"[M]ost rejected returns are valid, requiring taxpayers to jump through additional hoops to resubmit their returns electronically or submit the returns on paper,\" she wrote. \"Most taxpayers receive refunds, and delays in processing both paper-filed and e-filed returns translate into refund delays.\"",
      "People who have been victims of identity theft are another group that often face delays in getting resolution. About half a million taxpayers are still trying to their their issues fixed, although it took the IRS about 22 months on average to resolve the cases and send refunds to the victims, she added.",
      "That can be stressful for taxpayers waiting for their refunds, but it also creates an additional cost to the federal government, which must pay interest on overpayments it doesn't refund on a timely basis, the report pointed out.",
      "Some businesses, meanwhile, are facing delays due to the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit created in the pandemic to help businesses stay afloat. But the IRS has\u00a0flagged the ERC as vulnerable to fraud, leading to delays in processing returns.",
      "The IRS is \"still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024\" for returns that claimed the Employee Retention Credit, the report said. \"Although its aim was to minimize the payment of ineligible claims, there have been lengthy delays in the payment of eligible claims submitted by employers that, in some cases, are depending on ERC refunds to remain in business.\"",
      "When does tax filing open in 2025?",
      "Tax filing typically begins at the end of January, although the IRS hasn't yet announced when it will start accepting all returns.",
      "Some taxpayers can start filing on Jan. 10, however, the IRS said on Tuesday. That's because its Free File service will start accepting returns on Friday, it noted.",
      "The IRS Free File program, which is offered through tax software companies, is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.",
      "It's a different service than the IRS' relatively new Direct File service, which will be available in more than 20 states this tax season, from Alaska to Wyoming.",

The company \"routinely and uncritically accepts the original furnisher's response to the disputed information, even when the response was improbable or illogical on its face, or when Experian has other information available that suggests the furnisher is unreliable.\" Experian then fails to inform consumers of its findings, and instead offers confusing and incorrect information, CFPB stated.",
      "Further, Experian reinserts inaccurate information into credit reports because it fails to match newly reported information with records of previously deleted information. Those who disputed the accuracy of an account and thought their report had been corrected instead see the same false information reappear without explanation, the agency found.",
      "The CFPB's lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in California, seeks to stop the company's unlawful conduct and a civil money penalty, which would be paid into the agency's victims relief fund.",
      "Experian dismissed the agency's lawsuit as \"completely without merit\" and said it would prevail in court.",
      "\"We take great steps to ensure we investigate every consumer dispute thoroughly and go above and beyond the requirements of the law,\" the company stated.",
      "Based in Dublin, Ireland, Experian employs 22,500 people in 32 countries. Its North American corporate headquarters is based in Costa Mesa, California.",

    "story": [
      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health Care, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 19:50:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump was found guilty in May of 34 felonies for authorizing a scheme in 2017 to falsify records in order to cover up reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment.",
    "story": [
      "Appearing in court virtually from his Mar-a-Lago home Friday, President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced for his crimes in the\u00a0New York \"hush money\" case\u00a0and released with no restrictions.",
      "Justice Juan\u00a0Merchan\u00a0followed through on a promise made one week ago to give Trump a sentence of unconditional discharge, which includes neither jail time nor any other restriction that might impede Trump after his inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "Merchan said during sentencing Friday that he was granting that sentence because he believed it was the only legal option, just 10 days before Trump assumes the presidency.",
      "Merchan told the court that \"this has been a truly extraordinary case,\" even though once the courtroom doors closed, the trial itself had been in his estimation no more special or unique than any other.",
      "However, he told Trump, the same could not be said about the circumstances surrounding the president-elect's sentencing \"because of the office you once occupied and will soon occupy again.\" Merchan said that it was the legal protections afforded to the office of the president that were extraordinary, \"not the occupant of the office.\"",
      "Those legal protections were a factor that overrode all others, Merchan said, but they were not a mitigating factor. He said they did not reduce the seriousness of the crimes or erase the jury's verdict.",
      "Merchan said he determined that the only lawful sentence he could give, without encroaching on the highest post in the land, was an unconditional discharge.",
      "Donald Trump, the civilian, he said, might not have gotten so lenient a sentence.",
      "In the courtroom, Trump and attorney Todd Blanche \u2014 who has also been tapped by the president-elect to serve as deputy attorney general \u2014 could be seen via video feed sitting next to each other, with two American flags visible behind them, in a room with dark wooden walls.",
      "Trump was given the opportunity to address the court. He called the trial \"a very terrible experience\" and \"a tremendous setback for New York.\"",
      "\"With all the horrible things that are going on, I got indicted for calling a legal expense a legal expense,\" Trump said, referring to the falsified reimbursements to a former lawyer, for a \"hush money\" payment at the core of the case.",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said on camera. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "\"The fact is I'm totally innocent,\" Trump said. \"I did nothing wrong.\"",
      "Ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Trump's actions in attacking the judicial system and prosecutors in this case \"constitutes a direct attack on the rule of law itself.\"",
      "\"Far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct, the defendant has purposefully bred disdain for our judicial institutions and the rule of law, and he's done this to serve his own ends, and to encourage others to reject the jury verdict that he finds so distasteful,\" Steinglass said.",
      "\"Put simply, this defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system, and has placed officers of the court in harm's way,\" Steinglass said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was in attendance, in the gallery, but did not address the court.",
      "Blanche said that he strongly disagreed with Steinglass' assessment of the case and Trump's conduct. He claimed it was not just Trump and experts cited by Trump who felt the case should not have been brought, but the majority of the American people, referring to those who voted for the Republican in November.",
      "At every turn, Trump and his lawyers have fought Manhattan prosecutors since the beginning of the \"hush money\" investigation in 2018. They challenged prosecutors' subpoenas and rulings by Merchan, battling all the way to the Supreme Court multiple times, including an effort this week to stave off Friday's hearing.",
      "On Thursday, the Supreme Court said it would not intervene on Trump's behalf, clearing the way for Merchan to issue his decision. Trump, soon after the high court's decision, said he had read it and \"thought it was a fair decision, actually,\" noting the Supreme Court justices pointed out he could appeal and that there would be \"really\u2026no penalty.\"",
      "\"But we're going to appeal anyway,\" he added in his remarks Thursday night.",
      "\"So, I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent,\" Trump said.",
      "Although there are no cameras in the courtroom, an audio recording of the proceedings will be released after the hearing concludes.",
      "While Trump's trial and arraignment brought crowds and overnight lines, on Friday morning, the general public line was sparse and no onlookers in the park across the street were visible before dawn.",
      "Trump was found guilty in May after a seven-week trial. A unanimous jury concluded he committed 34 felonies in authorizing a scheme in 2017 to falsify records, in order to cover up reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.",
      "Daniels testified during the trial, as did Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen, who received the falsified reimbursements for his wire to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen gave Daniels the $130,000 payment in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.",
      "Multiple witnesses testified that Trump was pleased voters did not learn of Daniels' story before the 2016 election.",
      "Merchan held Trump in contempt 10 times during the trial for violations of a gag order barring him from making public comments about witnesses, court staff and others. In issuing the 10th contempt citation, Merchan \u2014 who frequently acknowledged the unique circumstances of the trial and its famed, powerful defendant \u2014 foreshadowed Friday's likely sentence.",
      "\"The last thing I want to do is to put you in jail,\" Merchan said.",
      "Merchan on Friday told Trump, \"the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching on the highest office in the land, is an unconditional discharge.",
      "\"Godspeed as you assume your second term in office,\" Merchan said.",

      "The comments from the Greenlandic leader, M\u00fate B. Egede, came after Trump said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure in order to make Greenland \u2014 a semiautonomous territory of Denmark \u2014 a part of the United States. Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S. Melting sea ice has\u00a0opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic, and Western powers have\u00a0already voiced concern about\u00a0Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "Egede acknowledged that Greenland is part of the North American continent, and \"a place that the Americans see as part of their world.\" He said he hasn't spoken to Trump, but that he's open to discussions about what \"unites us.\"",
      "\"Cooperation is about dialogue. Cooperation means that you will work towards solutions,\" he said.",
      "Egede has been calling for independence for Greenland, casting Denmark as a colonial power that hasn't always treated the Indigenous Inuit population well.",
      "\"Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American. We want to be Greenlandic,\" he said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen.",
      "Trump's desire for Greenland has sparked anxiety in Denmark as well as across Europe. The United States is a strong ally of 27-nation European Union and the leading member of the NATO alliance, and many Europeans were shocked by the suggestion that an incoming U.S. leader could even consider using force against an ally.",
      "But Frederiksen said that she sees a positive aspect in the discussion.",
      "\"The debate on Greenlandic independence and the latest announcements from the U.S. show us the large interest in Greenland,\" she said. \"Events which set in motion a lot of thoughts and feelings with many in Greenland and Denmark.\"",
      "\"The U.S. is our closest ally, and we will do everything to continue a strong cooperation,\" she said.",
      "Frederiksen and Egede spoke to journalists after a biannual assembly of Denmark and two territories of its kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The meeting had been previously scheduled and wasn't called in response to Trump's recent remarks. Trump's eldest son also made a visit to Greenland on Tuesday, landing in a plane emblazoned with the word TRUMP and handing out Make America Great Again caps to locals.",
      "The Danish public broadcaster, DR, reported Friday that Trump's team encouraged homeless and socially disadvantaged people in Greenland to appear in a video wearing the MAGA hats after being offered a free meal in a nice restaurant. The report quoted a local resident, Tom Amtof, who recognized some of those in a video broadcast by Trump's team.",
      "\"They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,\" he said.",
      "Greenland has a population of 57,000. But it's a vast territory possessing natural resources that include oil, gas, and rare earth elements, which are expected to become more accessible as ice melts because of climate change. Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite. These rare materials are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries. China currently produces about 65% of the world's graphite.",
      "While Copenhagen is responsible for its foreign affairs and defense, the U.S. also shares responsibility for Greenland's defense and operates a base there, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",

    "summary": "Two Georgia election workers asked a federal judge to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt for allegedly continuing to defame them in violation of a court order.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., found Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court Friday, saying that he violated a court order not to defame two former Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss.",
      "D.C. District Judge Beryl Howell said Friday that Giuliani had violated the consent judgment against him \"at least six ways.\" She said his statements \"accuse plaintiffs of improper, illegal conduct in relation to the 2020 election,\" in violation of the injunction.",
      "\"Mr. Giuliani engaged in the worst kind of defamation, wrongly accusing these two women, these plaintiffs, of engaging in serious election crimes,\" Howell said, although he had agreed not to make such statements.",
      "\"It is outrageous and shameful that Mr. Giuliani dares to suggest that he is the one being treated unfairly when his conduct has caused the plaintiffs real harm, as he heard about at the trial,\" the judge said.",
      "In 2023, a jury awarded Freeman and Moss $148 million in a judgment against Giuliani for falsely claiming the pair engaged in a fake ballot processing scheme in Fulton County, Georgia, during the 2020 election. District Judge Beryl Howell determined Giuliani was liable for defaming the two after they became focal points of his unfounded claims.",
      "Late last year, the women alleged Giuliani continued to defame them, claiming he had said on two broadcast shows that video showed them \"quadruple counting\" ballots and passing hard drives meant to \"fix\" voting machines. Court papers quote Giuliani saying in a Nov. 12, 2024 broadcast, \"I'm sorry they're going to sue me again for saying it, but what am I going to do but tell the truth?\"",
      "\"These statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,\" attorneys for the women wrote in court filings.",
      "At the outset of Friday's hearing, Judge Howell told Giuliani, \"You're the most famous person in this courtroom right now. You've got a bigger audience. You've got a bigger public following than anybody in this courtroom. You have a respected public service history with that background.\"",
      "\"I had hoped that what you heard, sworn to under oath in this courtroom, would make you realize that what you were saying about the plaintiffs just wasn't true, and that you'd stop saying those things,\" she continued.",
      "Giuliani protested, \"No, I did not,\" when she said he'd sworn to not say anything to defame Freeman and Moss.",
      "Freeman and Moss' attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said of Giuliani's comment claiming the two passed hard drives to each other that \"this is a specific reference, referenced multiple times in the appendix to the injunction about his allegation, which is a false allegation that our clients were passing a hard drive in order to influence the machines.\"",
      "Gottlieb argued that it was clear Giuliani was talking about Freeman and Moss with the comment that the two were seen \"quadruple counting ballots,\" because there's only one video from the 2020 election in Georgia that Giuliani has ever alleged involved multiple counting of ballots, the video from the State Farm Arena, in Atlanta. This, he said, was \"a crystal clear reference\" to Freeman and Moss.",
      "Judge Howell pressed Gottlieb on how anyone would know Giuliani was specifically referring to Freeman and Moss, since he never referred to them by name. But Gottlieb responded that the average person should not be the standard applied in this case.",
      "\"The injunction was specifically written to avoid a situation where [Giuliani] might not use their names, but instead might talk obliquely in order to convey the same defamatory meaning, the same implications about the plaintiffs, without using their names directly,\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Giuliani's attorney, Eden Quainton, claimed Giuliani's legal team had not been told of the examples of defamation after the trial and claimed the allegations were not clear.",
      "\"When you look at the text of those videos, the fact that he had to bring in another video that wasn't previously brought to our attention as proof of what the November 12 said, that really undermines the idea that he had clear and convincing evidence to start with,\" Quainton said.",
      "Judge Howell stopped Quainton several times and at one point told him, \"This is really a waste of time.\"",
      "Freeman and Moss are seeking a $20,000 monetary compensation for each future violation of the consent judgement, paid to the court using Giuliani's exempt assets, such as his IRA account and Florida condominium. They're asking for an order specifying that Giuliani use any assets he claims as assets, some of which are currently being litigated in New York. Howell indicated she planned to rule on a motion Friday.",
      "Since the defamation trial, Giuliani has appeared in several separate court proceedings about his ability to pay the fine.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Manhattan held him in contempt for failing to turn over information about his assets to contribute to paying off the $148 million he owes. Court papers say he has handed over some possessions, including a car, but the court said he failed to give them access to his other assets and information. The litigation over his finances continues.",
      "Ahead of Friday's hearing in Washington, D.C., Giuliani had asked to appear virtually, citing health problems and safety concerns. He ultimately withdrew that request after the judge appeared skeptical of his claims.",
      "Giuliani and his defense team pushed back on the latest claims, alleging Freeman and Moss failed to \"present clear and convincing evidence of a violation,\" adding they did not consider \"Giuliani's substantial compliance with the consent judgment since its entry.\"",
      "His attorneys argued the alleged violations did not meet the standard of contempt and his statements had been unclear and lacked context.",
      "\"Giuliani has scrupulously avoided mentioning the names of the Plaintiffs and has, as noted, referenced the Georgia ballot counting irregularities in connection with his other legal issues, including a pending indictment in Arizona,\" they wrote.",
      "Freeman and Moss disputed these claims. Their attorneys urged the court to put Giuliani \"on notice that he will face fines for any similar conduct that occurs in the future.\"",
      "Throughout the days-long trial that resulted in the $148 million ruling, jurors heard directly from Freeman and Moss, who described the terror they felt after they were thrust into the public eye after the 2020 election. The mother and daughter both said their lives had been changed when they were publicly identified, and a barrage of racist threats followed.",
      "An investigation by the Georgia secretary of state later concluded that \"[a]ll allegations made against Freeman and Moss were unsubstantiated and found to have no merit.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration on Friday announced it would extend the temporary legal status of nearly 1 million immigrants from El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela, utilizing a program that is expected to be curtailed by the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The announcement will allow Salvadoran, Sudanese, Ukrainian and Venezuelan immigrants who currently have Temporary Protected Status to renew their work permits and deportation protections under the policy, which offers a legal reprieve to foreigners from countries beset by war, natural disasters or other emergencies that make deportations unsafe.",
      "The decision is set to benefit roughly 234,000 Salvadorans; 1,900 Sudanese; 104,000 Ukrainians; and 600,000 Venezuelans, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the programs. The TPS program for El Salvador will be extended through March 2026, while the designations for Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela will be extended through October 2026.",
      "Friday's move is notable since TPS is expected to be scaled back by the President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to dismantle Biden administration immigration policy, enact tougher immigration rules and launch a mass deportation campaign. TPS designations can be revoked by the DHS secretary, as long as the government provides a 60-day notice.",
      "Trump and incoming Vice President JD Vance have both signaled their opposition to TPS, which Republican lawmakers and immigration hawks have long argued has been improperly extended, despite its temporary nature. During Trump's first administration, the government tried to end TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, though its efforts were stalled by legal challenges.",
      "While it announced the TPS extensions, the Biden administration on Friday declined to make new arrivals eligible for the temporary status, despite calls from progressive activists who say the move would make it harder for Trump to carry out his promised mass deportations. Redesignating the TPS program for Venezuela, for example, would make an additional 450,000 migrants eligible for the initiative, according to internal government estimates obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Biden administration has also faced pressure from advocates to allow hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants to apply for TPS ahead of Trump's inauguration. But officials are leaning against it, two people familiar with internal deliberations told CBS News, in part due to concerns about the move appearing like a politically motivated effort to hinder the incoming administration.",
      "Friday's move affects a diverse population of immigrants, with different legal circumstances.",
      "Salvadorans with TPS have generally been in the U.S. for over two decades, since 2001, when immigrants from El Salvador were first granted the temporary status following devastating earthquakes in the small Central American country.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump received a sentence of unconditional discharge in a New York court for his conviction in the \"hush money\" case.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to be released with no restrictions Friday after his criminal conviction in the\u00a0\"hush money\" case in New York.",
      "Though he'll receive no punishment under the unconditional discharge sentence, Trump and his attorney pledged to appeal his conviction as he prepares to take office in 10 days as the 47th president of the United States. Speaking virtually from his residence in Florida, Trump continued to insist during the hearing that he's \"totally innocent.\"",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said on camera. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "Prosecutors had also recommended a sentence of unconditional discharge, given Trump's impending inauguration, but not before blasting Trump's behavior and the precedent it sets.",
      "\"Put simply, this defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system, and has placed officers of the court in harm's way,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.",
      "Listen to the Trump sentencing hearing audio",
      "Although cameras were not allowed in the courtroom to provide video of the hearing, after its conclusion the court released the audio, which can be heard in the player above.",
      "What was Trump sentenced for?",
      "The case stemmed from a\u00a0$130,000 \"hush money\" payment\u00a0Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors claimed the payment was made to keep voters unaware of Daniels' allegation that she had sex with Trump years earlier, a claim Trump still denies.",
      "Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree, a felony in New York, and a jury convicted him on all 34 counts.",
      "What is an unconditional discharge?",
      "An unconditional discharge, the sentence Merchan imposed on Trump, allows release without any formal punishment or ability to impose punishment at a further date.",
      "That means no prison time, no community service volunteer time and no fines for his conviction. The maximum sentence, which a first offender would have been unlikely to receive, was four years in prison and several thousand dollars in fines for each of the 34 counts.",
      "\"This court has determined that the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching on the highest office in the land, is an unconditional discharge,\" Merchan told Trump, wishing him \"Godspeed\" on his second term.",
      "The sentence is a highly unusual one, which Merchan suggested he had imposed because of legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States.",

In 2024, the border agency removed more than 14,000 foreign nationals from Canada for violating the same law, according to Purdy.",
      "Defense attorney Carmen Hernandez, who represents Vo in his Jan. 6 case, said she learned of Vo's arrest in Canada from news reports.",
      "\"All I can say is that I have not heard from him since he was arrested,\" Hernandez said.",

Another rioter took a photo of Vo standing next to his mother, Annie Vo, in the Capitol's Rotunda as he raised a flag above his head.",
      "Prosecutors allege Vo was inside the Capitol\u00a0for approximately 27 minutes, snapping photos and yelling \"Freedom!\" while moving through the Capitol complex.",
      "At a court hearing in April, prosecutors argued Vo had already demonstrated a pattern of defiance against the court system. Vo was accused of violating his pretrial release conditions by attending a protest outside of the Washington, D.C., jail in support of Jan. 6 rioters. The judge placed a curfew on Vo during his case, due to violations of court orders, according to the Justice Department's filings.",
      "In a court filing, prosecutors said, \"Vo's complete lack of remorse for his actions on January 6 should also animate the Court's decision regarding his sentence. Within minutes of leaving the Capitol building on January 6, Vo used text messages and social media to brag about intimidating\u00a0police officers, halting the vote count, and storming the building. His lack of contrition continued after his trial when he repeatedly used social media to dispute his guilt, where he called himself a 'J6 wrongful convict.'\"",
      "A jury convicted Vo of four misdemeanors after a trial in September 2023.",
      "Vo later told the judge that he was \"sorry that January 6 happened,\" according to a transcript of his sentencing hearing.",

      "Find updates from the TikTok Supreme Court arguments here.",
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith submitted his final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Atlanta on Thursday rejected a bid to block the release of a portion of\u00a0special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigation and prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump stemming from an alleged plan to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied the request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, who were charged for their role in allegedly obstructing a separate federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records.",
      "The 11th Circuit granted Smith's request to drop Trump from the case in late November after he was elected to a second term in the White House because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But federal prosecutors are moving forward with the appeal of a lower court decision dismissing the charges against Nauta and de Oliveira on the grounds Smith was unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "Smith submitted a two-volume final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday evening that detailed his investigations into Trump. The first volume relates to the prosecution stemming from the 2020 election, and the second volume pertains to the president-elect's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office in 2020.",
      "Garland has pledged to disclose to the public all special counsel reports completed while he was attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified.",
      "But lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira earlier this week sought to stop Smith's report from being made public, arguing it would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the documents case, to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon on Tuesday agreed to temporarily block the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolves the matter, leaving it to the appeals court to decide whether Smith's work should be made public. Her order remains in effect for another three days, though the appeals court said if the Justice Department would like to seek relief, it could file a notice of appeal.",
      "On Thursday night, the Justice Department filed its appeal of Cannon's injunction. That appeal now also goes to the 11th Circuit.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment, as did lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira. Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said in a statement that \"It is time for Joe Biden and Merrick Garland to do the right thing and put a final stop to the political weaponization of our Justice system.\"",
      "In filings with the 11th Circuit, the Justice Department asked the court to deny Nauta and de Oliveira's bid to keep the report shielded from the public, but said Garland would not release the portion that deals with the classified documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing.",
      "Separately, the president-elect's lawyers\u00a0urged Garland\u00a0in a letter to remove Smith from his post as special counsel and stop the preparation and dissemination of his report.",
      "Prosecutors said the attorney general does plan to disclose to Congress and the American people the first volume of Smith's report involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume about the documents case available for review only by the top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Garland on Wednesday informed the top Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committees that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "In their own filing with the 11th Circuit, defense lawyers urged the court to send the dispute back to Cannon's court for a hearing and, in the meantime, prevent Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report.",
      "\"A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial,\" they wrote.",
      "Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit, his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to block the release of Smith's report.",
      "The report, they claimed, is \"nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden announced Thursday that for the next six months, the federal government will pay for 100% of the disaster response costs from the\u00a0wildfires\u00a0destroying neighborhoods across the greater Los Angeles area. The president also said he'll be asking Congress for more funding to help.",
      "Speaking from the White House during a briefing on the fires, the president said federal funding will cover things like removing debris, setting up temporary shelters, and paying first responders. Mr. Biden said he's surging all federal resources possible to Southern California, including 400 federal firefighters and 30 federal firefighting planes, among other assets.",
      "\"I told the governor and local officials, spare no expense,\" Mr. Biden said, calling the damage \"catastrophic.\"",
      "The 100% disaster response coverage from the federal government for the next 180 days is an increase from the current 75% the president previously allotted, and more than the 90% Mr. Biden said California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested. The damage is expected to be one of the most expensive disasters in California history. Three fires are still raging, the president said, and 179,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes.",
      "Congress may need to pass supplemental funding to buoy rebuilding efforts, and the president urged Congress to \"step up.\"",
      "\"I'm going to make an appeal right now to the United States Congress,\" he said.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been working with displaced locals to get them immediate supplies, like baby food. The president said the federal government will help people there not just recover, but eventually rebuild.",
      "\"We are with you,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We're not going anywhere. To the firefighters and first responders, you are heroes.\"",
      "Top Biden administration officials said, aside from immediate risks to life and safety, their greatest long-term concern is the mental health strain this disaster is placing on residents.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, whose neighborhood in Southern California was evacuated, called the damage \"apocalyptic.\" No one was at her home when the neighborhood was evacuated, her press secretary said.",
      "\"We are literally waiting to see which way the wind blows,\" she said.",
      "The president also said he has a family member who lives in the affected area, and that family member said more than 200 homes in the neighborhood have burned. The president didn't reveal the identity of that family member.",
      "Multiple fires have so far killed at least five people, leveling homes and scorching vegetation and wildlife in their wake. The Palisades fire along the coast is the largest one, followed by a fire in Pasadena further inand.",
      "Officials Thursday said more than 1,300 structures have burned, with 60,000 structures threatened, as the blazes burn largely uncontained in densely populated and expensive neighborhoods of Southern California.",
      "Mr. Biden was supposed to speak in Thermal, California, earlier this week, but his remarks were canceled due to excessive high winds. He was briefed on the fires while in California instead. The president canceled a trip to Italy to see Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni this week so he could focus on the federal response to the blazes.",
      "The president approved Newsom's request for a presidential major disaster declaration, freeing up federal resources to support the response.",
      "U.S. Forest Service air tankers and 10 federal firefighting helicopters are working to cut off the fires, and the Forest Service has positioned dozens of fire engines, the White House said Wednesday. The Pentagon has also readied firefighting personnel and capabilities. Hurricane-force\u00a0Santa Ana winds, dry conditions and a lack of sufficient water have fueled the fires. High winds are expected into Friday.",
      "The president was briefed on the latest about the fires and response to them Thursday before the late President Jimmy Carter's funeral.",
      "Asked if he believes the next administration will give California the aid it needs, the president responded, \"I pray to God they will.\"",

    "story": [
      "A plea hearing to enable alleged 9/11 terror attack mastermind\u00a0Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u00a0to avoid the death penalty will not go forward Friday, after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday to pause the proceedings to allow the court to receive full briefings and hear arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The court did not rule on whether Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has the power to reverse the plea agreements with Mohammed and other defendants, but instead said it needs more time to make that decision.",
      "The U.S. government had filed a\u00a0motion\u00a0earlier this week seeking to stop a military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from accepting the plea agreements offered to three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, including Mohammed.",
      "According to the motion, the plea agreements reached over the summer, which are still under seal, would have the three defendants plead guilty to the seven charges against them for their alleged roles in the terrorist attacks, in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty. The charges include murder, conspiracy and terrorism, as well as an eighth charge of intentionally causing serious bodily injury.",
      "Government attorneys also asked the appeals court to stay the proceedings \u2014 including Mohammed's plea hearing Friday \u2014 while the request was being considered.",
      "Family members who travelled to Guantanamo Bay are devastated that the plea proceedings won't go forward Friday. Eight of them were speaking to reporters when the court granted the administrative stay. All eight supported the plea agreements, though they acknowledged other victims' families do not.",
      "Stephan Gerhardt, whose brother Ralph died in the World Trade Center in the terrorist attack, said, \"I think by delaying this to the next administration, the Biden administration failed the families of 9/11. For whatever political agenda they had. We cannot pin our hopes on the next administration to resolve this for us.\"",
      "Deborah Garcia, whose husband David also died in the World Trade Center, said she had hoped for the finality of a judgment that would be settled by the plea agreements, \"because if these guys die (now), they die innocent.\"",
      "Garcia is here with her son Dylan, whose 28th birthday was Thursday and was just 4 years old when his father died.",
      "\"I felt I failed my husband that he was at the Trade Center, and I feel like this adds onto my sense of failure,\" Deborah Garcia said. \"I still can't bring this to justice.\"",
      "Claire Gates teared up as she talked about her mother, Carol Freund, who has been coming to Guantanamo Bay since 2013. Gates' uncle, Peter Freund, was a firefighter and Carol Freund's brother.",
      "Gates said of the trip with her mother, \"I see her in so much pain all the time, and this was the first time I got to be here to see it for myself. And it was supposed to be a time for healing for us, and we'll board that plane still with that just deep sense of pain that never seems to \u2014 there's just no end to it.\"",
      "She added that she had hoped this visit would bring her mother \"some sense of resolution after all of these years.\" She said she was glad to have come to support Freund, but \"this is not the ending to this trip that I thought we would be experiencing together.\"",
      "Soon after the plea agreements were reached,\u00a0Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0tried to revoke them, arguing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the power to approve the plea deals, rather than the subordinate authority who accepted the deals.",
      "The judge in the 9/11 case and then a military appeals court ruled against Austin and said he had weighed in too late. Austin has since reiterated that he still feels he should be the person who makes the decision on the 9/11 plea deals. On Thursday, during a trip to Germany, Austin was asked again about his decision to revoke the deals.",
      "\"I've stated where I am on this, and I haven't changed,\" he replied. \"We are in the process of appealing that ruling, and since we are appealing, I don't have any comment.\"",
      "There are also two other defendants in the case, but one hasn't negotiated a plea deal, and the other has been ruled mentally unfit to stand trial.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch effort by lawyers for President-elect Donald Trump to forestall his sentencing for his New York criminal conviction.",
      "The five justice majority that voted to deny Trump's application wrote that the evidentiary issues Trump has complained about \"can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.\"",
      "They also noted that the judge overseeing Trump's New York case has signaled he will not sentence Trump to serve any time in jail, writing \"the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's stated intent to impose a sentence of 'unconditional discharge' after a brief virtual hearing.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have granted Trump's application for a postponement of sentencing, the majority wrote.",
      "Speaking to reporters from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where the president-elect is meeting with Republican governors, Trump said he still plans to appeal the case, despite that the sentencing will lack jail time.",
      "\"They acknowledge what the judge said about no penalty, and there is, really, there's no penalty, but we're going to appeal anyway,\" Trump said.",
      "\"So I read it, and I thought it was a fair decision, actually. So I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent,\" he added.",
      "The incoming president sought an emergency reprieve from the nation's highest court after the New York judge who oversaw Trump's trial on Jan. 3 sent the president-elect hurtling toward the long-delayed sentencing.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan rejected Trump's latest motions to dismiss the case, and set aside his conviction, which argued a president-elect is entitled to the same protections from criminal proceedings as a president. Trump, who railed against the case for years, also said evidence shown at trial that related to his first presidency violated that same constitutional immunity.",
      "New York prosecutors objected to any further delay of the sentencing hearing, which has now been scheduled four times since Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.",
      "They noted in multiple filings this week that Merchan already telegraphed his sentencing decision on Jan. 3, when he said he was inclined to release Trump without incarceration or any other restriction.",
      "In May, a unanimous jury found Trump guilty for authorizing a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a so-called \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. The payment was made before Trump's first election in 2016, but Trump signed off on the reimbursements to his former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen \u2014 and an accompanying coverup \u2014 during his time in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump says it was unconstitutional for the jury to see evidence and hear testimony from the years when he was in the White House.",
      "Trump's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to prevent his sentencing, set for just 10 days before his inauguration, \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\"",
      "The case has wound its way to the Supreme Court repeatedly since Manhattan prosecutors began their investigation in 2018. In a landmark 2020 decision, the court ruled that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records. Trump continued to fight their release even after that decision, until 2021, when the Supreme Court again rejected his efforts to shield the financial records.",

    "summary": "Court to hear arguments Friday on law forcing TikTok sale by Chinese parent company that takes effect in Jan. 19.",
    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

The bill marks the first policy legislation of the new Congress, and the House approved it in a bipartisan vote of its own on Tuesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune will now decide which, if any, amendments will be considered on the floor. Some Democrats who voted to proceed said they did so in order to offer changes to the legislation before deciding how they would vote on final passage.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",
      "Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security is mandated to detain noncitizens convicted of certain crimes, including \"aggravated felonies,\" or serious offenses like murder and sexual assault. The Laken Riley Act would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes.",
      "Whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding is an open question. The agency is currently using roughly 39,000 of 41,000 detention beds funded by Congress.",
      "The legislation would also empower state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "A growing list of Democrats announced their plans to support the Republican-led measure ahead of Thursday's vote, including Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. Fetterman and Gallego are co-sponsors in the Senate, and Slotkin voted for the legislation as a member of the House last year.",
      "On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer chimed in, saying ahead of the vote that he would support advancing the legislation and that he expected it to have enough votes to move forward.

This week, 48 House Democrats joined all voting Republicans to approve the measure \u2014 up from 37 who did so last year \u2014 despite pushback from some Democrats who have argued that the bill is merely political posturing.",

I think we all remember that day when then-Governor Carter made his famous inaugural address and for the first time a Georgia Governor called for a commitment to the traditions of Martin Luther King and for the decency that his leadership stood for over Dr. King's lifetime.",
      "\"I was surprised when then-candidate Gov. Carter asked me to join him as his running mate in 1976. He amazed me then as he has every year since and following his presidency. He, of course, was brilliant, as we all know. He had a great sense of humor. While we had only 4 years in the White House, he achieved so much in that time. It stood as a marker for Americans dedicated to justice and decency. Today we come to say goodbye to our friend and to deeply thank his partner, Rosalynn, who is with us today. God bless you Rosalynn.",
      "\"Carter was a man of his word. I remember when we talked about his concept of the vice presidency. I told him that I would like to do it and I had only two requests. I wanted to make a real contribution and didn't want to be embarrassed or humiliated as many of my predecessors had been in that office. He agreed, welcomed my full participation, directed his staff to treat me as they would him and, during our 4 years in the White House, he was very careful to protect me from the frustration and too often humiliation that had cursed the lives of many vice presidents. These were good years for Joan and me. Because of that, I want to thank the President for the good choices he made of his key personnel, key advisors and political leaders. We don't have time to mention many of them but Stu Eizenstat comes as close as humanly possible to rivaling President Carter's formidable work ethic. Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell were blessings every day during my time in the White House.",
      "\"One of the things that dawned on me during the course of our time together in the White House is how well we seemed to work together and how we seemed to understand each other and how, unlike a lot of vice presidents and their presidents, our relationship did not blow up. I think one ofthe realities was that Carter was a devout Christian who grew up, as we know, in a small town and was active in his faith for almost every moment of his life. I was also a small-town kid and I grew up in our small Methodist church where my Dad was the preacher and our faith was very basic to me as Carter's faith was to him. That created a bond between us that allowed us to understand each other and to find ways to work together because ofour common commitment to our faith.",
      "\"Joan loved her time as the second lady and we have Jimmy and Rosalynn to thank for helping her champion the public arts while we were together and for being so kind to her. With his leadership, we created the model vice presidency, a real partnership between the President and the Vice President. Working together, we did change how my office acted to provide new levels of support to his presidency. We became very close friends. We often spent hours together throughout the day. We were working on real problems, not wasting time. That model vice presidency that Carter helped create has been followed in one way or another by later administrations of both parties. Our personal relationship we established while we were in office continued throughout our lives. He allowed me to take a leadership role on issues that never would have been allowed before. I worked in a central role in trying to bring decency to the Vietnamese and Southeast Asian boat people who were fleeing their countries. With President Carter's orders, the boat people were picked up by our great Navy from their flimsy boats which were capsizing and took them to safety. Most became good American citizens working for a healthy and prosperous nation. Compare this to how we are tragically dealing with the crisis of immigrants today.",
      "\"Carter was farsighted. He put aside his short-term political interests to tackle challenges that demanded sacrifice to protect our kids and grandkids from harm one or two decades out. Very few people in the 1970's had heard the term \"climate change\". Yet Carter put his presidency on the line to pass laws to conserve energy, deregulate new oil and gas prices and invest in clean, renewable solar, wind and geothermal alternatives to fossil fuels. It wasn't a perfect program but, thanks to Carter, U.S. energy consumption declined 10% between 1979 and 1983. In many ways, he laid the foundation for future presidents to come to grips with climate change. Some thought he was crazy to fight so hard to pass these bills, but he was dead right.",
      "\"All of us know President Carter elevated human rights to the top of his agenda but sometimes we forget how seriously he pushed to advance the rights of women. He proposed and signed the law extending the period for states to approve the Equal Rights Amendment, which now, finally, has been ratified by three quarters of the states. He appointed women to head the Departments of Commerce, Education, HEW and HUD. Women on his White House staff played crucial roles in developing his highest priority energy and environmental proposals and laws deregulating our oil and gas, trucking and airline industries. And he dramatically increased the ranks of female circuit and district court judges, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In all he appointed five times as many women to the federal bench as all of his predecessors combined.",
      "\"Two decades ago, President Carter said he believed income inequality was the biggest global issue. Two years ago, in a speech in Lynchburg, he said \"I think now... it is the discrimination against women and girls in the world,\" including the brutal killing of female infants, sexual abuse, human trafficking, honor killings and the rest. He concluded that, until the stubborn attitudes that foster discrimination against women change, the world cannot advance and poverty and income inequality cannot be solved.",
      "\"Amen!",
      "\"Toward the end of our time in the White House, the President and I were talking about how we might describe what we tried to do. We came up with this sentence which to me remains an important summary of what we were trying to do. \"We told the truth, we obeyed the law and we kept the peace.\" That we did, Mr. President. I will always be proud and grateful to have had the chance to work with you toward these noble ends. It was then and always will be the most rewarding experience of my public career.\"",

Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",

    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",

      "In announcing the social media giant's decision to end fact-checking\u00a0in the U.S. on Facebook, Instagram and other Meta platforms, Zuckerberg said the move would \"dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms.\" In a Facebook post explaining the company's shift to a community-driven moderation approach, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan also said that \"Too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail'.\"",

      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "But those running the nonpartisan entities behind Meta's third-party fact-checking efforts said they had nothing to do with whether a post was removed from a platform, noting that the company was the final arbiter of what content it published.",
      "\"Facts are not censorship. Fact-checkers never censored anything,\" Neil Brown, president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonprofit devoted to media literacy, said in a statement. Poynter's PolitiFact is among the entities that had teamed with Meta on fact-checking.",
      "Meta's official fact-check program launched in 2016 with a number of third-party partners.vFact-checked posts were labeled and then demoted, reducing their distribution. But the posts weren't removed outright, according to Meta. What does get removed are severe content violations like posts supporting terrorism or promoting child sexual exploitation.",

      "Among Meta's fact-check partners, Poynter's PolitiFact said it offered independent reviews and disclosed its sources, while Meta set the rules about what content was removed.",

      "\"In our experience and that of others, Community Notes on X are often slow to appear, sometimes downright inaccurate and unlikely to appear on controversial posts because of an inability to reach agreement or consensus among users,\" Maarten Schenk, co-founder and chief operating officer at Lead Stories, said in a post Tuesday on the fact-checking site. \"Ultimately, the truth doesn't care about consensus or agreement: the shape of the Earth stays the same even if social media users can't agree on it.\"",

      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",

The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",

      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

      "Which is why Morton plans to continue these sessions for as long as Manger is able. And why he will always end each one with the same words of gratitude:",
      "\"Almost everything I learned about teaching was from you,\" Morton tells Manger.",
      "And although Manger will soon forget that compliment, Morton says that's actually fine by him.",

      "At least four people were injured Friday morning after a Minneapolis-bound Delta Airlines flight aborted its takeoff at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, airport officials said.",
      "Approximately 200 passengers evacuated the plane through emergency slides and some were seen running through the snow and away from the aircraft, according to the airline and a video obtained by CBS affiliate WANF. The plane had experienced an engine problem, Delta spokesperson Morgan Durrant said.",
      "The incident happened while a snowstorm was causing widespread cancellations and delays in Atlanta, the world's busiest airport. But officials can't say if the problem had anything to do with the weather.",
      "The 201 passengers, two pilots and five flight attendants aboard evacuated the Boeing 757-300 using inflatable slides and were bused back to a concourse. One of the injured passengers was taken to a hospital, while three were treated at the airport for minor injuries.",
      "Durrant said the flight crew \"followed established procedures to suspend the takeoff.\"",

      "All five of the runways at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport were closed for at least a time on Friday and Delta said at noon on Friday that it had already canceled about 500 flights at the airport. The airline said in a news release that snow \"began earlier and with heavier intensity than forecast, which reduced deicing capability and slowed operations.\"",

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK --\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to unconditional discharge Friday, a symbolic end to his New York \"hush money\" case.",
      "The sentence carries neither jail time nor any other restrictions that might impede his inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "In May, a jury\u00a0found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts\u00a0of falsifying business records.",
      "What happened in the courtroom",
      "The president-elect appeared virtually for the hearing from his Mar-a-Lago home, side by side with defense attorney Todd Blanche.\u00a0 They were seated with American flags behind them.",
      "Just prior to the proceeding, Trump and Blanche could be seen being jovial, appearing to laugh and joke with one another, CBS News New York's Alice Gainer reported.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was present in court for the sentencing. The courtroom itself was bitterly cold, due to an apparently broken window in a nearby restroom that was open.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse in Manhattan.",
      "When proceedings began, prosecutors spoke, saying they too recommended a sentence of unconditional discharge. They said Trump was found guilty, that he falsified 34 separate entries with the intent to defraud to promote his own election, Gainer reported. As they said that, Trump shook his head \"no,\" crossed his arms, and appeared to take notes.",
      "Prosecutors went on to say that Trump was far from expressing remorse, and engaged in a campaign to undermine the court's legitimacy. Prosecutors said Trump attacked the rule of law itself, Gainer reported.",
      "Then Blanche spoke, calling Friday a sad day, saying they intend to pursue an appeal, and that Trump and his family were very upset about the entire thing.",
      "Trump then addressed the court, repeating much of what he said to cameras during the trial.",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "Trump also spoke about the gag order he was under, said he was treated very unfairly, and called the case an embarrassment to New York, Gainer reported.",
      "\"The fact is, I'm totally innocent,\" he added. \"I did nothing wrong.\"",
      "Before imposing the sentence, Judge Juan Merchan had the last word.",
      "\"Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,\" he said. \"The protections afforded the office of the president are not a mitigating factor, they do not reduce the seriousness of the crime... The only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgement of conviction without encroaching on highest office in land is an unconditional discharge.\"",
      "The judge also wished Trump godspeed as he begins his second term.",
      "Trump's attorneys are appealing the verdict.",
      "Gainer covered the trial from the start and breaks down the timeline of what led up to sentencing.",
      "From the National Enquirer to \"Access Hollywood\"",
      "In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president.",
      "In August 2015, his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen and American Media Inc. CEO David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer, met at Trump Tower. Prosecutors say they formed a conspiracy to bury negative information about Trump in order to help get him elected.",
      "Pecker testified about two \"catch and kill\" deals, where he bought and then did not publish accusations against Trump \u2014 one, with Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump.",
      "In August 2016, Pecker paid McDougal $150,000, structuring the agreement to get around campaign finance law, telling the jury, \"We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign.\"",
      "In September 2016, Cohen secretly recorded a conversation with Trump, allegedly about paying him back. \"We'll have to pay him something,\" Trump was heard saying. Pecker testified he ultimately did not need to be paid back.",
      "On Oct. 7, 2016, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, where Trump is caught on a hot microphone talking about groping women, was released. Former Trump aide Hope Hicks testified it was a \"damaging development\" for the campaign.",
      "\"Hush-money\" payments for Playboy model, adult film star",
      "On Oct. 27, 2016, days before the election, Cohen paid adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen testified that before paying her, Trump was polling very poorly with women and if Daniels' story got out, Trump thought \"women will hate me.\"",
      "In February 2017, Cohen says he met Trump at the White House and talked about reimbursement. Cohen said he submitted false invoices for legal services, and Trump signed off on monthly checks of $35,000.",
      "The defense countered Cohen was his attorney and did work for Trump and his family in 2017. But Cohen maintained he did less than 10 hours of work that year for them and never billed them.",
      "Trump faced\u00a034 felony counts of falsifying business records, and the jury found him guilty on all counts.",
      "Question of presidential immunity",
      "Sentencing was set for July 11, but was postponed at the defense's request after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity. It was again postponed to September, and then again to after the election.",
      "It was pushed back again after Trump won, so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on how to proceed. Trump's attorneys filed to dismiss, saying it was unconstitutional to hold criminal proceedings related to a president-elect.",
      "Judge Merchan denied the motion, writing, the \"defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",
      "His attorneys tried multiple times to request a stay of the sentencing while they appeal, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court. All requests were denied.",

    "summary": "Dry vegetation helped fuel fires that spread through the Los Angeles area in early January 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Ming Pan\u00a0is a senior research hydrologist at the\u00a0University of California, San Diego.",
      "Dry conditions across Southern California set the stage for a series of deadly wind-driven wildfires that burned thousands of homes and other structures in the Los Angeles area in early January 2025.",
      "Ming Pan, a hydrologist at the University of California-San Diego's Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, tracks the state's water supplies. He put Southern California's dryness into perspective using charts and maps.",
      "How dry is Southern California right now?",
      "In early January, the soil moisture in much of Southern California was in the bottom 2% of historical records for that day in the region. That's extremely low.",
      "Hydrologists in California watch the sky very closely starting in October, when California's water year begins.",
      "The state gets very little rain from May through September, so late fall and winter are crucial to fill reservoirs and to build up the snowpack to provide water. California relies on the Sierra snowpack for about one-third of its freshwater supply.",
      "However, Southern California started out the 2024-25 water year pretty dry. The region got some rain from an atmospheric river in November, but not much. After that, most of the atmospheric rivers that hit the West Coast from October into January veered northward into Washington, Oregon and Northern California instead.",
      "When the air is warm and dry, transpiration and evaporation also suck water out of the plants and soil. That leaves dry vegetation that can provide fuel for flying embers to spread wildfires, as the Los Angeles area saw in early January.",
      "So, while Northern California's water and snowpack conditions are in good shape, Southern California is much drier and its water storage is not doing so well.",
      "The Southern Sierra snowpack was starting to dip below normal in early January.",
      "What can California expect for the rest of 2025?",
      "The U.S. Climate Prediction Center's seasonal outlook through March suggests that drought is likely to develop in the region in the coming months.",
      "The outlook takes into account forecasts for La Ni\u00f1a, an ocean temperature pattern that was on its way to developing in the Pacific Ocean in early 2025. La Ni\u00f1a tends to mean drier conditions in Southern California. However, not every La Ni\u00f1a affects California in the same way.",
      "One or two big rain events could completely turn the table for Southern California's water situation. In 2023, California saw atmospheric rivers in April.",
      "So, it's hard to say this early in the season how dry Southern California will be in the coming months, but it's clear that people in dry areas need to pay attention to the risks.",

    "summary": "Palestinian officials say the war in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, as some on both sides of the conflict hope for \"help from Donald Trump.\"",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Israeli military strikes killed more than 600 people in the Gaza Strip in the first 10 days of 2025, pushing the death toll over 46,000 since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry, and one new estimate suggests it could be much higher. Israel launched the war after Hamas carried out its unprecedented terrorist attack, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "The total number of dead in Gaza represents a little more than 2% of the tiny enclave's population, with an average of about 3,000 people killed each month or 100 killed each day since Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel 15 months ago.",
      "Israel has rejected the figures provided by Palestinian officials and blames Hamas for all deaths in Gaza, accusing the group of using civilians as human shields. But new research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests the figure provided by the Gazan health ministry for the first nine months of the war could have been understated by as much as 40%.",
      "Gaza death toll an underestimate, Lancet study suggests",
      "From the beginning of the war through June 30, 2024, Gaza's heath ministry said just under 38,000 people had been killed by traumatic injuries, but the Lancet's estimate \u2014 published in a peer-reviewed study based on data from health authorities, social media obituaries and an online survey \u2014 was that more than 64,000 people had been killed during that time.",
      "CBS News is unable to independently verify the numbers, and Israeli authorities have prevented Western journalists from entering Gaza to report independently since the war started.",
      "The Lancet noted that its estimate does not include thousands more people still believed to be buried under rubble, or those who have died from a lack of access to food, water or medical care during the war.",
      "\"I am broken inside after losing my family,\" 21-year-old Mahmoud Sukkar told CBS News' local team in Gaza. All 17 members of his family were killed, including his mother, father and twin brother, when an Israeli strike hit their home in Gaza City in the first month of the war.",
      "Sukkar, the only survivor, now lives alone in a tent camp in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.",

      "Israel continues attacking Houthis in Yemen",
      "As Israel continues its strikes against the remnants of Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces said Friday that its naval and air forces had struck multiple Houthi rebel targets on Yemen's west coast and inland, including ports and a power station.",
      "The Houthis, like Hamas, are backed by Iran, and they've launched repeated missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. and Israeli military vessels and Israeli territory in support of their allies since the war in Gaza began. The U.S. has also carried out many strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen over the last year.",
      "\"The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world,\" said the IDF in a statement.",
      "\"As we promised \u2014 the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a separate statement.",
      "Progress, but no breakthroughs in ceasefire talks",
      "Iin Doha, Qatar, meanwhile, American and Arab negotiators have made \"real progress\" this week toward a deal between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and hostage release in the waning days of the Biden administration, the U.S. president said Thursday, but it has not appeared sufficient for any major breakthrough to be announced, or to warrant higher-level officials flying back to the region.",
      "\"We're making some real progress, I met with negotiators today,\" Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House. \"I'm still hopeful that we will be able to have a prisoner exchange. Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange right now, but I think we may be able to get that done, we need to get it done.\"",
      "U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk had been working to hammer out the technical details of a proposal, but Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea did not fly to Doha this week as Israeli media had said he might, and there was no indication that CIA chief William Burns was in Qatar, either. Both men have joined the talks repeatedly when there's been hope of a potential agreement.",
      "One apparent sticking point in the talks has been the unconfirmed condition of 34 Israeli hostages in Gaza who were listed on a document that Hamas resurfaced this week after it first emerged last summer. Israel has demanded to know who on the list is still alive and who is dead. Hamas demanded a four-day ceasefire to contact its network of militants across Gaza to confirm the hostages' condition, saying Israel's ongoing operations made it impossible for the group to assess otherwise.",
      "Family members and friends of the hostages have protested regularly in Israel to demand that Netanyahu's government strike a deal to bring them all home at the same time. Israeli officials believe about 100 hostages are still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza, though at least 30 are believed to be dead.",
      "If a ceasefire does take shape, the first phase would involve a swap of hostages for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, along with a surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza.",
      "But another major hurdle is Hamas' consistent demand that Israeli forces completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip \u2014 something Israel has thus far refused to accept.",
      "Some Israelis and Palestinians hope for \"help from Donald Trump\"",
      "If a deal is not achieved by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, some Israelis \u2014 and Palestinians \u2014 hope he will bring a needed change to the negotiations, potentially for the better.",
      "\"He is unpredictable and he is brave,\" Ilay David, brother of 24-year-old hostage Eyvatar David, told CBS News at a rally in Jerusalem on Friday afternoon. \"We have to think out of the box, and Trump can bring that change.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump is known for being mostly a businessman,\" said 19-year-old Palestinian cybersecurity student Ameen Abu Fkheida at Birzeit University in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \"I don't think he will be a friend [of Palestinians], but I do think there will be some sort of help from Donald Trump regarding the case of Gaza, which could probably be a ceasefire or an exchange of prisoners or something to deescalate the current situation in Gaza.\"",

      "Zelenskyy spoke at a meeting of about 50 allies at the American military's Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the last such gathering before Trump takes office on January 20. His imminent return to the White House has cast doubt on future American support for Ukraine's war effort, given previous favorable remarks about Russia's authoritarian President Vladimir Putin and Trump's vow to quickly end the war nearly three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "While he's offered no clear indication as to how he intends to achieve that, many in Ukraine and across Europe are concerned Trump could make good on the promise by withholding aid to Ukraine and pushing Zelenskyy to negotiate a truce that lets Russia maintain control over some of the vast territory is has occupied in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.",
      "\"It's clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world \u2014 just 11 days from now, a time when we have to cooperate even more, rely on one another even more, and achieve even greater results together,\" said Zelenskyy, adding that he saw it \"as a time of opportunities.\"",
      "As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, which it will hit on Feb. 24, Zelenskyy repeated a call for Western allies to send troops to help Ukraine.",
      "\"Our goal is to find as many instruments as possible to force Russia into peace,\" he told the meeting. \"I believe that such deployment of partners' contingents is one of the best instruments.\"",

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin \u2014 who launched the Ramstein format shortly after the war started \u2014 announced the new military aid package on Thursday.",
      "The aid, which includes a wide range of missiles and other weapons and equipment, as well as provisions for services, training and transportation, will be the 74th such package provided from existing U.S. military inventories for Ukraine since Mr. Biden took office, the State Department said in a statement.",

      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sarcastically on Wednesday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "Standing before a 17th-century world map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" or \"Mexican America,\" because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",

      "\"Humor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\" said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"Although President Sheinbaum knows it won't work on everything - Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",

According to Canada's CTV News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was questioned by a reporter on Monday about Trump's multi-prong threats to\u00a0impose a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico\u00a0in the first hours of his presidency, as well as making Canada the \"51st state.\"",

      "Prosecutors say Ebisawa didn't know he was communicating in 2021 and 2022 with a confidential source for the Drug Enforcement Administration along with the source's associate, who posed as an Iranian general. Ebisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting.",
      "DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a release that the prosecution demonstrated the DEA's \"unparalleled ability to dismantle the world's most dangerous criminal networks.\"",
      "She said the investigation \"exposed the shocking depths of international organized crime from trafficking nuclear materials to fueling the narcotics trade and arming violent insurgents.\"",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim said Ebisawa admitted at his plea that he \"brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma.\"",
      "\"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma,\" he added.",
      "Court papers said Ebisawa \u2014 who U.S. prosecutors say is a leader of Japan's notorious Yakuza mafia \u2014 told the DEA's confidential source in 2020 that he had access to a large quantity of nuclear materials that he wanted to sell. To support his claim, he sent the source photographs depicting rocky substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation, claiming they contained thorium and uranium, the papers said.",
      "The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an \"ethnic insurgent group\" in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, prosecutors said. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege.",
      "Prosecutors said samples of the alleged nuclear materials were obtained and a U.S. federal lab found they contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that the \"the isotope composition of the plutonium\" was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon.",
      "Last year, prosecutors posted photos of the purported nuclear materials allegedly sent by Ebisawa.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Ebisawa conspired to sell 500 kilograms of methamphetamine and 500 kilograms of heroin to an undercover agent to be distributed in New York. He also allegedly worked to launder $100,000 in purported narcotics proceeds from the U.S. to Japan.",
      "\"As he admitted in federal court today, Takeshi Ebisawa brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York. \"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma and laundered what he believed to be drug money from New York to Tokyo.\"",

It attributed the decline largely to legislation passed to combat organized crime that includes measures like barring members of designated groups from opening bank accounts, renting apartments, buying cell phones or insurance.",

      "Some Iranian analysts who are critical of the government and spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said the drills may be a demonstration of power by Iran prompted by the dramatic changes in the balance of power in the Middle East \u2014 with Israel severely disabling Iranian-backed groups in Gaza and Lebanon, and long-time Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad being toppled by rebel forces.",

      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Those deposits are likely to draw the interest of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's become a close adviser to Trump after providing more than $270 million last year to back his and other Republicans' candidacies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why would Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Trump said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" Trump said.",
      "Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed Trump's claims.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "Panama's Foreign Minister Javier Mart\u00ednez-Acha said Tuesday that his government hadn't spoken formally with Trump or his team about the canal recently, but he reiterated previous comments from the country's president that the canal would remain under Panamanian control.",
      "\"The sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest,\" said Mart\u00ednez-Acha.",
      "China has also denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

      "\"So far, we have not found that precursors arrive, because most of the precursors come from Asia, and that the whole process is manufactured here in Mexico,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said. \"The laboratories that have been dismantled in our country are mainly for methamphetamine or crystal (meth).\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed that her government was committed to combating illegal drug distribution. In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 as well as chemical precursors. Officials said last month that the seizure of over a ton of fentanyl pills was the biggest in the country's history.",

    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 An Italian journalist detained in Iran for three weeks and whose fate became intertwined with that of an Iranian engineer wanted by the United States was freed Wednesday and is heading home, Italian officials announced.",
      "A plane carrying Cecilia Sala took off from Tehran after \"intensive work on diplomatic and intelligence channels,\" Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said, adding that Meloni had informed Sala's parents of the news.",
      "Iranian media acknowledged the journalist's release, citing only the foreign reports. Iranian officials offered no immediate comment.",
      "Sala, a 29-year-old reporter for the Il Foglio daily, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, three days after she arrived on a journalist visa. She was accused of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic, the official IRNA news agency said, but no details of her purported transgressions were ever provided by Iranian officials.",
      "Word of Sala's release was met with cheers in Italy, where her plight had dominated headlines, as lawmakers hailed the successful negotiations to bring her home.",
      "It came after Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida last weekend to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Meloni tweeted Sala's return in a statement on X in which she thanked \"all those who helped make Cecilia's return possible, allowing her to reembrace her family and colleagues.\"",
      "Italian commentators had speculated that Iran was holding Sala as a bargaining chip to ensure the release of Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport three days before on Dec. 16, on a U.S. warrant. Iranian analysts who spoke with CBS News on the condition they remain anonymous said the same thing.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department accused Abedini and another Iranian of supplying drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. He remains in detention in Italy.",
      "Their fates turned into a diplomatic tangle as each country's foreign ministries summoned the other's ambassador to demand the prisoners' release and decent conditions. The saga was particularly complicated for Italy, which is an historic ally of Washington, but traditionally maintains good relations with Tehran.",
      "Since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis, which saw dozens of hostages released after 444 days in captivity, Iran has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations with the world.",

    "story": [
      "Genetically engineered mosquitoes with toxic semen could be a new weapon against tropical disease, Australian scientists said after trialing the novel pest control method.",
      "The \"toxic male technique\" aims to breed mosquitoes that express venomous proteins in their semen, killing off females after mating.",
      "Female mosquitoes are targeted because only they bite and drink blood, thereby spreading diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.",
      "Scientist Sam Beach from Australia's Macquarie University said the method \"could work as quickly as pesticides without also harming beneficial species.\"",
      "\"This innovative solution could transform how we manage pests, offering hope for healthier communities and a more sustainable future,\" Beach said.",
      "The first proof-of-concept trials used fruit flies, a common laboratory species favored for its short two-week life cycle.",
      "Female flies that bred with \"toxic\" males had a significantly reduced lifespan, the scientists found.",
      "Researcher Maciej Maselko said the team would now trial the method in mosquitoes.",
      "\"We still need to implement it in mosquitoes and conduct rigorous safety testing to ensure there are no risks to humans or other non-target species,\" he said.",
      "The mosquitoes would need to be genetically modified so they only expressed the toxic semen once they were released into the wild, the researchers said.",
      "This could be done through so-called \"conditional expression\" techniques, which use chemicals or other biological triggers to turn specific genes on or off at will.",
      "This would allow venomous males to successfully mate with females in lab conditions, producing enough viable offspring for the technique to be scaled up.",
      "Genetic engineering has been used for years to control populations of disease-spreading mosquitoes.",
      "Typically, these approaches slow reproduction by releasing hordes of male insects that are genetically modified to be sterile.",
      "Computer models showed techniques actively killing biting females could be far more effective, the research team said.",

      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned in a recent advisory about alcohol use increasing cancer risk.",
      "The advisory notes that alcohol can increase the risk of throat, liver, esophageal, mouth, larynx (voice box), colon and rectal cancers, making it the \"third leading preventable cause of cancer\" in the U.S.",
      "This guidance follows the rise of the \"sober curious\" trend, with younger generations scaling back on how much they drink or choosing not to partake at all.",
      "ALCOHOL LINKED TO CANCER RISK IN US SURGEON GENERAL'S NEW ADVISORY",
      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "\"It might also manifest subtly, like overspending on impulse purchases or having trouble waiting your turn in group discussions,\" she said.",

      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, Anderson noted.",
      "\"You might struggle to start tasks, even when vital, or abandon them halfway through,\" she said. \"You might jump between tasks without finishing anything or focus on smaller, less urgent tasks while the bigger, more critical ones remain untouched.\"",

      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel evaluates the Biden administration\u2019s push to expand weight-loss drug coverage ahead of the Trump transition on \u2018America Reports.\u2019",
      "A new trend gaining popularity among people trying to lose weight is microdosing the diabetes medication Ozempic.",

      "She is also the author of the book \"The Ozempic Revolution\" that is set to be released on Jan. 7.",
      "Fox News Digital spoke to the experts to get the skinny on this latest trend.",
      "What is microdosing?",
      "Microdosing Ozempic refers to using smaller amounts compared to the\u00a0standard therapeutic doses that are traditionally prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes and aiding weight loss, experts say.",
      "This practice is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "IS EATING ONCE A DAY A GOOD IDEA? EXPERTS SHARE VARYING OPINIONS ON THE \u2018OMAD DIET\u2019",
      "\"Health care clinicians do not typically recommend this approach, as the standard dosing regimen is based on clinical trials determining the most effective and safe amount for these conditions,\" noted Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford,\u00a0obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.",
      "There are no established guidelines for microdosing \u2013 although there are reports on social media of using 10 to 100 times lower than standard prescriptions, added\u00a0Dr. Christopher McGowan, a\u00a0gastroenterologist and obesity specialist who runs True You Weight Loss in Cary, North Carolina.",
      "\"Health care clinicians do not typically recommend this approach.\"",
      "Some people get confused by the terminology, the doctors noted.",
      "\"I think there's a little bit of a misconception, as some people say \u2018I'm microdosing\u2019 when they're just on the starting doses or don\u2019t go all the way up in the escalation titration dosing of the medication,\" Sowa said.",
      "Benefits of microdosing",
      "The primary reason for microdosing is to reduce costs, according to McGowan.",
      "For example, he said, a patient might think that if a full prescription costs over $250 per week, they may be able to achieve some benefit with just $25 worth of the medication.",
      "With approximately 70% of American adults meeting the criteria for being obese or overweight, more people are turning to weight loss medications to help them shed pounds. (iStock)",
      "The average monthly retail price of Ozempic ranges from $1,000 or more without insurance, per GoodRx.",
      "People may also pursue microdosing to reduce the incidence or severity of side effects such as nausea, vomiting or stomach discomfort, according to Stanford.",
      "\"Some individuals might start with microdoses to gradually acclimate their body to the medication, potentially easing into the full therapeutic dose over time,\" she said.",
      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "Any potential benefit of the medication, however, will likely wane proportionally with lower doses, experts noted.",
      "Individuals may also microdose due to supply challenges, according to Dr. Amy Rothberg,\u00a0clinical professor of medicine in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes at the University of Michigan.",
      "\"Some individuals might start with microdoses to gradually acclimate their body to the medication, potentially easing into the full therapeutic dose over time.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Some feel they may derive a benefit from microdosing by being able to extend their supply and may perceive an effect,\" Rothberg, who is also the medical director of Rewind, a lifestyle program for type 2 diabetes patients, told Fox News Digital. \"As we know, the placebo effect may have a strong impact.\"",
      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",
      "\"Microdosing Ozempic or other [weight-loss] medications is entirely off-label and unproven, with no supporting clinical studies,\" he cautioned.",
      "OZEMPIC COULD HELP REDUCE ALZHEIMER\u2019S RISK FOR SOME, STUDY SUGGESTS: \u2018SHIFTING THE PARADIGM\u2019",
      "Stanford also warned that smaller doses may not provide adequate blood sugar management, leading to uncontrolled diabetes and associated complications.",
      "It can also lead to suboptimal weight loss and unpredictable results, as well as the potential for misuse, she added.",
      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "People who microdose often use a \"compounded\" version of the medication,\u00a0which the FDA does not regulate.",
      "\"This introduces risks such as contamination, inconsistent formulations and uncertainty about the actual strength of the product being injected,\" McGowan stated.",
      "Without changes to diet and physical activity patterns, the long-term benefits will disappear once the drug is stopped, one doctor noted. (iStock)",
      "Additionally, these compounded versions are usually dispensed in vials, which requires a syringe to draw it up, in contrast to the FDA-approved versions that are simpler to use.",
      "Using the compounded versions through vials runs the risk of drawing up too much medication \u2014 so instead of\u00a0microdosing, it's possible to macrodose, Sowa warned.",
      "Medical supervision is key",
      "Some providers are still comfortable offering microdosing for select patients with one caveat \u2014 that\u00a0people should always consult a health care clinician before altering their medication regimen.",

      "\"As long as it is being dispensed and monitored by a physician, I don\u2019t see how anybody is going to overdose, especially when we are giving such small amounts,\" Dr. Suzanne A. Trott, a double board-certified plastic and general surgeon in Beverly Hills, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"I have seen a lot of patients who are given metformin for weight loss \u2014 I don\u2019t see how this is any different,\" said Trott, who runs her own microdosing clinic.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 17:05:04 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden on Thursday said that empty fire hydrants in the Los Angeles area were the result of an intentional power shutoff, but a report indicates the city&apos;s water utility might lack a common safety protocol.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Leo Terrell joined 'FOX & Friends First' to discuss how DEI has impacted the state's ability to prevent and respond to wildfires and why he blames their far-left policies for the devastation.",
      "Los Angeles' municipal utility lacks a common safety procedure that may have kept water pumping to fire hydrants during an intentional power shutoff, though President Biden said the outage caused the problem.Republicans, including President-elect Trump, have blamed Democratic officials \u2014 at least in part \u2014 for the water shortage, which has hampered efforts to fight devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County. However, Democrats have rebuked these claims, and on Thursday, Biden suggested the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) bore responsibility for shutting off power to pumps that fuel the hydrants.",
      "\"What I know from talking to the governor, there are concerns out there that there\u2019s also been a water shortage,\" Biden told reporters. \"The fact is the utilities, understandably, shut off power because they are worried the lines that carried energy were going to be blown down and spark additional fires. When it did that, it cut off the ability to generate pumping the water \u2014 that\u2019s what caused the lack of water in these hydrants.\"",
      "Biden noted that generators were being deployed following the shutdown to get power back to the pumps and ensure there is no longer a shortage of water to fight the fire.",

The protocol lays out plans for how to proactively shut down certain electricity lines during dangerous windstorms and limit the impact to public safety.",
      "\"Being prepared for a power shutoff takes careful planning, which begins by designing our water systems the right way and working with local fire agencies and energy companies to ensure community safety,\" California Water Service, a private utility provider in the state, explains on its website FAQ page about public safety power shutoffs.",

      "The Supreme Court on Friday heard oral arguments in a fast-tracked case over the future of TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media app that will be barred from operating in the U.S. in just nine days barring divestiture or eleventh-hour intervention from the high court.",
      "At issue is the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a law signed by President Biden that passed Congress in April with bipartisan approval. The act gave TikTok either nine months to either divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or be removed from U.S.-based app stores and hosting services.",
      "On Friday, lawyers for the Biden administration reiterated their argument that TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership poses a \"grave\" national security risk for American users.",
      "U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar cited risks that China could weaponize the app, including by manipulating its algorithm to prioritize certain content or by ordering parent company ByteDance to turn over vast amounts of user data compiled by TikTok on U.S. users.",
      "\"We know that the PRC has a voracious appetite to get its hands on as much information about Americans as possible, and that creates a potent weapon here,\" Prelogar said. \"Because the PRC could command ByteDance [to] comply with any request it gives to obtain that data.\"",
      "\"TikTok's immense data set would give the PRC a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage,\" she added.",

      "Earlier in oral arguments when TikTok was presenting its case, justices on the bench as a whole appeared skeptical of the company's core argument, which is that the law is a restriction of speech.",
      "\"Exactly what is TikTok's speech here?\" Justice Clarence Thomas asked in the first moments of oral arguments in an early sign of the court's apparent doubt that the law is in fact a First Amendment violation.",
      "At the conclusion of oral arguments, it remained unclear as to how the Supreme Court might proceed in the matter \u2014 though a ruling or order is expected before the Jan. 19 ban comes into force.",
      "The Supreme Court and its 6-3 conservative majority have been historically deferential to Congress on matters of national security.",
      "The divestiture law in question passed Congress last year with strong bipartisan support \u2014 as well as\u00a0the guidance of top Justice Department officials, who worked directly with House lawmakers to write the bill and help it withstand possible legal challenges.",
      "But the argument also comes at a time when President-elect Trump has signaled possible support for TikTok. His attorneys filed an amicus brief last month, urging the Supreme Court to delay the ban until he is sworn in as president.",
      "If the goal of China and ByteDance, through TikTok, is \"trying to get Americans to argue with each other,\" said Chief Justice John Roberts, \"I\u2019d say they are winning.\"",
      "Noel Francisco, TikTok\u2019s lawyer, on Friday sought to frame the case primarily as a restriction on free speech protections under the First Amendment, which the company argues applies to TikTok\u2019s U.S.-based incorporation.",
      "A TikTok logo is displayed on a smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China, on Thursday. (CFOTO/Sipa USA)",
      "First Amendment protections must be considered under strict scrutiny, which requires the government to sustain a higher burden of proof in justifying a law's constitutionality. More specifically, the law must be crafted to serve a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest \u2014 a test TikTok says the law fails to meet.",
      "It's a difficult legal test to satisfy in court. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit used it last month in considering the divestiture law, and still voted to uphold it \u2014 meaning that justices could theoretically consider the case under strict scrutiny and still opt to uphold the law \u2014 and the looming Jan. 19 ban.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Friday noted that the case before them appears to be the first one to be heard by the court centered directly on the ownership of a platform or app, rather than speech.",
      "The liberal justice also questioned whether the court might consider the divestiture requirement under the law as a data control case, not properly a free-speech issue, as TikTok's legal team has sought to frame it.",
      "President-elect Trump's X account is seen displayed on a smartphone alongside the TikTok logo. (Avishek Das / SOPA Images/Sipa USA)",
      "Weighing the case as a data control case would trigger a lower level of scrutiny \u2014 a point that Francisco also acknowledged.",
      "Francisco told justices in oral arguments on Friday that the U.S. government has \"no valid interest in preventing foreign propaganda,\" and that he believes the platform and its owners should be entitled to the highest level of free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "Francisco told Chief Justice John Roberts that he believes the court should grant TikTok First Amendment protections because it is operating as a U.S.-incorporated subsidiary.",
      "The TikTok attorney was also grilled over the Chinese government\u2019s control over the app, and ByteDance\u2019s control over the algorithm that shows certain content to users.",
      "Asked by Justice Neil Gorsuch whether some parts of the recommendation engine are under Chinese control, Francisco said no.",
      "\"What it means is that there are lots of parts of the source code that are embodied in intellectual property, that are owned by the Chinese government\" and which a sale or divestiture would restrict, he said. \"It doesn't alter the fact that this is being operated in the United States by TikTok incorporated.\"",

      "Oral arguments center on the level of First Amendment protections that should be granted to TikTok and its foreign owner, ByteDance.",
      "This is not the first time the Supreme Court has grappled with whether full First Amendment protections should be extended to foreign speakers. In previous cases, they have ruled that speech by a foreign government or individuals is not entitled to the full protections.",
      "The Biden administration, for its part, will argue that the law focuses solely on the company\u2019s control of the app, which attorneys for the administration argue could pose \"grave national security threats\" to Americans rather than its content.",

      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "A BREAKTHROUGH GADGET COULD HELP YOU DETECT MICROPLASTICS IN YOUR DRINKING WATER",

      "The floating solar still operates through an elegantly simple yet highly effective process. First, ocean water is drawn up to the device's foam surface through a wicking system. Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat, as shown by Teresa W.&apos;s near loss of thousands of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "With our lives so intertwined with digital communication these days, the threat of email fraud is something we all need to take seriously. Recently, Teresa W. shared a scary experience that underscores the dangers of business email compromise (BEC).",
      "\"I almost lost many thousands of dollars through an internet fraud scam. I got a call from our personal banker who said she saw nearly all the money in our business account being withdrawn. She said she got an email from me along with the money wiring directions. I told her I didn't send that and she said my email came from me directly to her. I said to stop everything and I will get to the bottom of it.",
      "\"Apparently the thieves got hold of a wiring instruction paper from my email, which they hacked into. They created a rule in Outlook to bypass me if anything came from them and go straight to the banker. They changed the wiring instructions to go into their account but thank goodness our banker alerted me so I could get to the bottom of it. Too close for comfort!\"",
      "This incident highlights a sophisticated scam where cybercriminals gain access to legitimate email accounts and use them to deceive others into transferring funds. Teresa\u2019s quick action, combined with her banker's vigilance, prevented a significant financial loss, but it serves as a wake-up call for many businesses.",

      "\"You\u2019ve been hacked!\" written on a laptop home screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is business email compromise (BEC)?",
      "Business email compromise (BEC) is a form of cybercrime that targets companies engaged in wire transfer payments and other financial transactions. The FBI reports that BEC scams have caused billions in losses globally. These scams exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, making them particularly insidious.",
      "A hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How the scam works",
      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",
      "A hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Real-life implications",
      "The consequences of BEC scams can be devastating for businesses. In addition to direct financial losses, companies may face reputational damage, loss of customer trust and potential legal ramifications. For small businesses like Teresa's, which may not have extensive cybersecurity measures in place, the impact can be particularly severe.",

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Proactive steps to avoid being a victim of BEC scams",
      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

      "The story shared by Teresa W. serves as a crucial reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our digital communications.

The umbrella can pump out 80 watts of power through USB-C and even has an XT-60 connection to power things like Anker's new EverFrost electric cooler.

The charging case is just 0.47 inches thick and is designed to stick to the back of your MagSafe-compatible phone. No more digging through bags or forgetting your earbuds at home.

Samsung Food can track your grocery deliveries, build shopping lists from your fridge contents and even suggest meal plans. Samsung's calling it the \"ultimate AI sous chef,\" and honestly, they might be onto something. Sure, the AI won't actually cook for you (bummer, right?). But for wannabe home chefs who get inspired by every cooking show and movie, this could be a total game-changer. Just don't blame Samsung if you end up spending more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking. Of course, you'll need a 2025 Samsung TV to access this culinary magic. Samsung Food will be available on the QN90F, QN80F and QN70F model TVs.",

      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",
      "The first company to shed light on the campaign was cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven, one of whose employees were targeted by a phishing attack on December 24, allowing the threat actors to publish a malicious version of the extension.",
      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",
      "In some cases, developers themselves may unknowingly include data-gathering code as part of a monetization software development kit, which stealthily exfiltrates detailed browsing data.

Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",

The new feature is part of the latest updates to Google Play Services and is designed to simplify and enhance your control over location sharing.",
      "What Location Sharing means",
      "Before you toggle this off, let\u2019s take a moment to understand why you might want it on and what happens when you turn it off.",
      "Imagine this: You\u2019re meeting a friend in a busy city, and instead of sending a dozen texts back and forth, they can simply see your real-time location on Google Maps. That\u2019s the power of location sharing. It allows you to share your exact position with specific contacts, along with useful details like your device\u2019s battery level or your estimated arrival time if you\u2019re navigating.",
      "But when location sharing is off, your movements stay private. No one can track where you are, and your personal information is better protected from potential misuse.

A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality.

While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection.

Jim Risch, R-Idaho., for \"waiting\" until the outgoing President had only 13 days left in office before declaring rebel actions in Sudan, a country torn apart by 21 months of bitter war, to be \"genocide.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that members of the Sudanese rebel group, the Rapid Support Forces or RSF, \"have committed genocide in Sudan.\"",
      "In a statement, Blinken said, \"The United States is committed to holding accountable those responsible for these atrocities. We are\u00a0sanctioning RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, known as Hemedti, for his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people.\"",

Leaders from the three nations are meeting in a first-ever trilateral summit in a show of solidarity as China's assertiveness in the South China Sea has raised tensions in the region.\u00a0 (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images.)",
      "Blinken made his rulings, he stated, because \"the RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians, have systematically murdered men and boys\u2014even infants\u2014on an ethnic basis, and (have) deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.\"",
      "The Secretary continued,\u00a0\"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "Blinken added that the African nation is suffering through \"a conflict of unmitigated brutality that has resulted in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian catastrophe, leaving 638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan\u2019s recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead.\"",
      "Risch has held out that the situation in Sudan has been catastrophic for well over a year, and called into question the timing of Blinken\u2019s declaration. In a statement earlier this week, he wrote, \"It has been nearly a year since I introduced a resolution calling the atrocities in Sudan what they are: a genocide. Additionally, I first called for Global Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed against the RSF and Hemedti 263 days ago \u2013 and yet these sanctions still have not been leveraged.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:21:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Lebanese parliament finally voted on a new president on Thursday following two years of deadlock. Joseph Aoun the head of the country&apos;s armed forces won a majority of the votes.",
    "story": [
      "Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah was planning to use bunker to stage attack on Israel. (Credit: IDF)",
      "Lebanon\u2019s political landscape has undergone a dramatic shift with the election of Joseph Aoun as president. After more than two years of political deadlock, the Lebanese Parliament elected the army commander on Thursday with 99 out of 128 votes.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election represents a significant achievement for the anti-Hezbollah camp, reflecting the weakening influence of the powerful Shia terrorist organization within Lebanon\u2019s political system. Despite this, experts say Hezbollah remains a formidable force in the country, and the challenges Aoun faces in balancing Lebanon's internal politics and foreign relations remain immense.",
      "For much of the past two years, Hezbollah worked tirelessly to block any movement toward the election of a new president. The group had strongly opposed Aoun\u2019s candidacy. However, as the political situation evolved and the ousting of Assad from Syria unfolded, Hezbollah was ultimately forced to accept Aoun, who secured the presidency.",
      "\"Hezbollah had been opposed to his election for the last two and a half years and had blocked any process toward electing a president for all that time. Now, they\u2019ve voted for him in the second round, which indicates they are in a bind, that they are weaker, and their leverage is not what it was,\" Vice President for International Engagement at the Middle East Institute Paul Salem told Fox News Digital.",

      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado&apos;s aides claim she was detained Thursday, despite denials by the country&apos;s socialist government.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "\"To the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\" he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Even many of Maduro\u2019s former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.",

      "And while public claims adjusters \u2014 who are privately hired by consumers looking to avoid insurance companies\u2019 adjusters \u2014 are warning that it can take years for claims to be resolved, California residents do enjoy some benefits not seen elsewhere.",
      "The primary benefit is that all California property insurers must immediately pay out a minimum of one-third of the estimated value of a policyholder\u2019s personal belongings, as well as a minimum of four months\u2019 worth of rent for the local area in which they live.",
      "Still, insurance industry experts are warning homeowners to expect to negotiate between the carrier, the claims adjuster and contractors for recouping losses and rebuilding \u2014 and that the ultimate payout for a home that has been damaged or totaled may be less than what policyholders thought they were getting.",
      "\u201cThink of it like a business transaction,\u201d said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a group that advocates on behalf of consumers. \u201cGive your insurance company the chance to do the right thing, but don\u2019t be a pushover, and have your eyes open. No one\u2019s going to come in with a magic wand.\u201d",
      "First steps",
      "Most insurance companies now let policyholders file claims online or even via mobile apps.",
      "However, they vary in the amount of documentation required. Experts say the documentation process will be key to recouping losses \u2014\u00a0and that many companies have become aggressive in determining what ultimately gets covered.",
      "To ensure the maximum payout, experts recommend taking detailed videos and photographs of the damage sustained, as well as compiling receipts for both items lost or damaged as well as purchases made while a policyholder is displaced. Don\u2019t throw anything away until the insurer has signed off on doing so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to be very thorough and get everything accounted for,\u201d said Janet Ruiz, the strategic communications director for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the insurance industry.",
      "Settling loss claims might also require reconstructing how a home looked before it was damaged or destroyed. Experts thus also recommend creating a photo album that contains images of a home\u2019s interior and exterior.",
      "Policyholders should also take detailed notes of any and all conversations they have throughout the process \u2014 names, dates and phone numbers.",
      "Getting paid",
      "While California carriers offer cash advances to get through temporary displacements, the payout amounts are often at depreciated values of the belongings, Ruiz said.",
      "As for payouts on damaged or totaled dwellings themselves, some long-term policyholders may find that while the value of their home had recently been climbing, they had not been paying for the equivalent amount of insurance.",
      "Thus, rebuilding their home back to or beyond its predisaster market value may prove difficult.",
      "On the other hand, some select policies contain what are known as \u201cextended replacement cost\u201d clauses, which allow policyholders to recoup the at-market cost of rebuilding a home.",
      "Still, insurers have become aggressive in rejecting certain claims, especially for partial damage in which smoke, ash and char may have been contributing factors, Bach said.",
      "All affected residents should also apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration assistance, though many will not qualify because they exceed income thresholds, Bach said.",
      "If you had no insurance",
      "If an individual recently bought a new home with cash, was kicked off a policy, or simply couldn\u2019t afford insurance, there are still options available.",
      "FEMA has already begun providing temporary assistance options, and the Small Business Administration is now taking applications for loans to homeowners; contrary to its name, the SBA provides assistance even to individuals who did not own businesses."

      "A 117-million gallon reservoir in one of the Los Angeles communities ravaged by wildfires was out of commission when the fire started in the area on Tuesday.",
      "The Santa Ynez Reservoir in the Pacific Palisades has been closed for repairs after a covering designed to preserve water quality tore. The Los Angeles Times first reported that the reservoir was offline.",
      "The reservoir\u2019s status may have limited the water system\u2019s ability to provide consistent pressure for firefighters, but Marty Adams, a former general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said it is unlikely to have made a significant difference in the battle against the Palisades Fire, which burned through 20,000 acres as of Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cIt was out of service. I don\u2019t know exactly how long it\u2019s been out of service,\u201d Adams said.",
      "During firefighters\u2019 response to the Palisades Fire, some high elevation fire hydrants dried up, hampering efforts to fight the blaze.",
      "On Friday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for an investigation into the water supply troubles and the reservoir's lack of availability.",
      "\"The ongoing reports of the loss of water pressure to some local fire hydrants during the fires and the reported unavailability of water supplies from the Santa Ynez Reservoir are deeply troubling to me and to the community,\" Newsom wrote. \"We need answer to how that happened.\"",
      "Newsom directed state water and firefighting officials to prepare an independent after-incident report \"examining the causes of lost water supply and water pressure\" and also requested that city and county officials provide a \"comprehensive review examining their local preparation and response procedures\" to the state.",
      "Adams, who retired about eight months ago, said the reservoir could have preserved some additional water pressure to fight the fires, but that it\u2019s unlikely it would have substantially changed outcomes."

      "Hundreds of animals are being cared for by humane groups in Southern California as this week's fast-moving wildfires continue to displace residents.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not something that will be resolved in a day, a week,\u201d said Ana Bustilloz, director of communications and marketing at the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles, or spcaLA, a local animal welfare organization. \u201cWe\u2019re at the ready to assist.\u201d",
      "From cats and dogs to horses, birds and tortoises, several rescue groups are hosting a menagerie of animals while the blazes hopscotch throughout the Los Angeles area. Some pets are staying as temporary boarders while the humans in their households stay in evacuation centers, hotels or other places that don\u2019t allow pets. Other animals are receiving treatment for injuries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve taken in some animals that were found stray near the fire areas, who have come in with burns, singed paws, singed whiskers, dehydration,\u201d said Dia DuVernet, president and CEO of Pasadena Humane, an animal resource center in Pasadena. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a huge community effort to try to figure out how we are going to respond to all the human and animal needs in our community.\u201d",
      "She said that, so far, Pasadena Humane has taken in over 400 animals. Among the most severely injured are ones being treated for dehydration and smoke inhalation, some of whom are on oxygen at the center\u2019s veterinary intensive care unit.",
      "The group has not had to turn anyone down who is looking for a place to keep their pet.",
      "\u201cIt has been cats, dogs, birds, goats,\u201d DuVernet said. \u201cOne desperate owner of a pony actually walked their pony down from the affected area to our shelter, where we cared for it until we could transport it to an equestrian center.\u201d",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires have killed at least 11 people, and well over 100,000 remained under evacuation orders Friday, according to authorities. Animal welfare groups in the area said the number of pets they have housed has fluctuated throughout the week but they worry it could rise.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going be way more animals displaced because there\u2019s way more people displaced,\u201d said Christi Metropole, president and CEO of Stray Cat Alliance, a Los Angeles-based cat rescue organization. \u201cThis is the calm before the storm.\u201d",
      "Owners have dropped off about 50 pets for temporary boarding at spcaLA, Bustilloz said. Among them are dogs, cats and a 30-year-old parrot named Ducky \u2014 who has delighted staff with the phrases she says, like, \u201cI\u2019m a pretty birdie!\u201d",
      "When the animals arrive at spcaLA, a veterinarian examines them and they receive blankets, calming toys and treats to make them feel as at home as possible, Bustilloz said.",
      "\u201cAs time goes on, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find ourselves doing different things. But for now, this is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe comfort that we can provide someone who is in distress, just knowing that their animals are cared for and safe, hopefully will give them a little reprieve so they can focus on other things they need to take care of.\u201d",
      "Wildfires and the particulates they release can be hazardous to pets, particularly animals with cardiovascular or respiratory illnesses, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The group says pets should be kept indoors as much as possible when the air is smoky. It advises all pet owners to have an evacuation kit on hand with three to seven days\u2019 worth of pet food, a pet carrier labeled with contact information, a collapsible feeding dish and water bowl, and other necessities.",
      "The rescue groups who spoke to NBC News are not in evacuation zones, but said they are only taking animals outside for brief periods this week for their safety.",
      "A little further out from Los Angeles, in Burbank, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center is also paying close attention to air quality. In the last week, the municipal recreation and park center that normally houses 500 horses received 200 to 300 additional horses from private homes or other equestrian centers where the smoke and fire posed a serious danger, said Jennie Nevin, the center\u2019s executive director of business development and communication.",
      "\u201cIt goes in and out,\u201d she said of the smoke in the Burbank area. \u201cWith the winds changing, we\u2019ve had some pretty bad air quality, and then today we\u2019ve seen a bit of relief.\u201d",
      "The Los Angeles Equestrian Center is equipped to handle other large animals, too. Earlier this week it welcomed Oliver, a pet pig estimated to weigh over 200 pounds, when his Pasadena-based owners struggled to find anywhere else to keep him.",
      "The rescue centers said they have been overwhelmed with donations, including bales of hay, blankets and pet food. Pasadena Humane has received so many donated pet supplies that it fears it will run out of room to host more animals in need, DuVernet said, and has started asking for only monetary donations going forward.",
      "Some owners who evacuated earlier in the week have received the all-clear to return home and have come to pick up their pets, said spcaLA\u2019s Bustilloz. Seeing pets reunited with their families has been the silver lining to an otherwise stressful week.",
      "\u201cIt just feels like a small step in the right direction,\u201d Bustilloz said."

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The largest wildfire to hit Los Angeles this week rapidly tore through homes and communities, whipped by winds that sent embers skyward.",
    "story": [
      "A little after midnight on New Year\u2019s Day, Francine Sohn was jolted awake by a phone call from a neighbor, who sounded hysterical. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire on the hill,\u201d the neighbor told her.",
      "Sohn, 72, looked outside and saw a small brush fire perilously close to her Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles. She watched firefighters douse the flames, waiting to see if she should flee. But there was no need: the wind was a brisk but manageable 15 mph, and the fire was contained before dawn with no homes damaged and no one hurt.",
      "A week later, the same thing happened: another small fire spotted in the same area. But this one turned into a monster.",
      "The Palisades Fire, now one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history, began in the backyard of Palisades Highlands, a secluded and well-to-do community overlooking the coast between Malibu and Santa Monica. Residents and hikers first saw it as a modest brush fire looming in the parched scrubland.",
      "But whipped by winds that hit 60 mph, the flames rapidly rolled over the mountainside and roared through neighborhoods, growing to more than 20,000 acres and consuming more than 5,000 structures. It is now one of six wildfires burning simultaneously in Los Angeles County that have forced 180,000 people from their homes and left at least 11 dead.",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly a dozen people who witnessed the Palisades Fire\u2019s early stages on the morning of Jan. 7 and watched it grow and move faster than any they had ever seen, leaving a path of ruin they did not think possible \u2014 even in a place where wildfires are a part of life.",
      "Sohn was already on edge that morning after seeing authorities\u2019 warnings that dry winter winds were forecast across drought-parched Los Angeles, raising the risk of wildfires.",
      "Then, as she set out from her home on Piedra Morada Drive for a 10:30 a.m. art class at the local recreation center, a neighbor shouted at her from across the street. She looked behind his house and saw fire in the brush less than a mile off. The neighbor\u2019s family had already called 911.",
      "Sohn didn\u2019t wait for anyone to tell her to evacuate.",
      "\u201cI ran in the house, woke up my friend, threw my dog in the car along with as many photo albums I could carry,\u201d she said, \u201cand hightailed it out of there.\u201d",
      "Up in the brush at about the same time, Beni Oren was on a trail run with friends near Skull Rock, a local landmark, when they smelled smoke. They turned and confronted flames about 100 feet away, Oren, 24, said.",
      "They ran in a panic, changing directions as they realized the wind was blowing the fire their way. A widening plume of smoke rose above the canyon as they got to safety. \u201cIt was a bizarre experience realizing like, f---, is all this about to be on fire?\u201d Oren said.",
      "Firefighters soon raced in, sirens blaring. On radios, they described it as a 10-acre brush fire on a ridgeline, and they planned to deploy aircraft to soak the rising flames. It was just after 10:30 a.m. The danger was already clear.",
      "\u201cIt is 100% in alignment with the wind. It has the potential for 200-plus acres in the next 20 minutes,\u201d one person reported over the Los Angeles County Fire Department\u2019s radio, according to a recording.\u00a0\u201cWe have a potential for structures being threatened in the next 20 minutes.\u201d",
      "Someone responded: \u201cIt is pushing directly towards Palisades.\u201d A few seconds later, he added: \u201cThis thing is going to make a good run.\u201d",
      "Alarmed residents of the Palisades Highlands, watching the growing fire from their backyards and decks, were coming to the same conclusion.",
      "Stephanie Libonati was at home with her mother and brother on Piedra Morada Drive when she saw flames and smoke about three-quarters of a mile away and screamed, \u201cFire!\u201d Her mother called 911, then Libonati and her brother ran outside to alert neighbors. They began packing up their photographs, passports and other valuables and made a plan: leave in three separate cars, meet up outside of town, then continue to her grandfather\u2019s ranch in Santa Clarita.",
      "By the time they headed out, the fire looked twice as big, Libonati, 26, said. Firefighters had arrived as well, telling her brother to stop soaking their back deck and get out of there.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a fire pit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could hear fire crackling and everything burning. And the smell was awful, ash blowing in our faces. It was just so fast. You kept seeing it spread and spread.\u201d",
      "Once they started driving, the family immediately got separated, their paths interrupted by flames and traffic and panic. As she drove through Palisades Village, a shopping district at the bottom of the hill, Libonati saw people on the side of the road filming the inferno above. \u201cNo one would ever expect the fire to come down to the village,\u201d she said. \u201cIt never has.\u201d",
      "They eventually met up, hugged, and continued to the ranch.",
      "The exodus continued, turning from a trickle into a mad rush. Palisades Drive, the single main road leading directly down the hill to Sunset Boulevard, was jammed with cars. Some tried Fire Road, an alternate evacuation route during emergencies, but before long that passage was surrounded by flames, residents said. Sunset slowed to a standstill.",
      "Many panicked drivers abandoned their cars in the road and took off on foot, forcing emergency crews to bulldoze the vehicles aside so that fire trucks could get through. Firefighters told residents in some parts of the neighborhood to stay put temporarily because there wasn\u2019t initially an imminent danger and there was no easy way out.",
      "The winds kicked up, engorging the flames and pushing embers into the air and down farther away, where they ignited new hot spots. The fire consumed the mountainside and swept through the Highlands, the village and the rest of the Pacific Palisades, then west along the coast to Malibu.",
      "Colin Fields and Vanita Borwankar, who live off Palisades Drive, set off in their car after receiving a text alert about potential evacuations. By the time they left their condo at 11 a.m., the fire was moving downhill, but the gridlock forced them to turn around. They headed back up the hill to Fields\u2019 parents\u2019 home at the edge of the canyon, where Fields and his brother sprayed hoses at encroaching flames and flagged flare-ups to firefighters."

In contrast, \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d a biopic about Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields, the first American woman to earn a gold medal in boxing, is a decidedly smaller picture.",

I think decontextualizing that and showing that just like Claressa Shields, or just like the character in \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 that he came from this other place, and through learning from his community, through really wonderful nurturing by a woman who is essentially his foster mother.\u201d"

      "Now, executives are bending policies \u2014 and bending a proverbial knee \u2014\u00a0by abandoning their social and environmental agendas in manners that could appeal to Trump. Leaders of multiple major media platforms appear to be reorienting their coverage to be less antagonistic. And Democrats, without much of an active resistance to underpin them, have taken a wait-and-see approach to a new president with whom they already have eight years of experience.",
      "\u201cWe should treat him like a normal president,\u201d a senior aide to a Democratic senator said. \u201cBecause this is what normal presidents look like in America now.\u201d",
      "The shift is due in no small part to how Trump won last fall. Whereas in 2016 many saw a fluke, Trump this time swept the swing states and won the popular vote. His victory came after episodes like the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his criminal indictments \u2014 headwinds many believed were insurmountable.",
      "What\u2019s more, much of his opposition, at least for now, appears to be drained after having fought him for nearly a decade. Now, Democrats feel they must pick their spots better.",
      "\u201cMy mission: be purposeful,\u201d Rep.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which banned Trump from those social media platforms after the 2021 attack on the Capitol, has donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. So has Amazon, which this week announced it will release a Melania Trump documentary through its Amazon Prime platform. The incoming first lady is listed as an executive producer of the project, which Amazon licensed for $40 million, Puck News reported.",
      "On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg cited the political climate\u2019s shift back toward Trump as his company made a flurry of moves indicating a desire to get right with the right. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, meanwhile, has spoken optimistically about Trump\u2019s potential anti-regulatory agenda in a new term. And five of the country\u2019s biggest banks have in recent weeks announced their withdrawals from a pandemic-era climate coalition, the latest pullback from the environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, initiatives that became a major target for criticism on the right.",

      "\u2018Surrender, or acceptance\u2019",

      "\u201cSo it\u2019s not just a question for the tech companies, but a larger societal, cultural and political issue,\u201d this person added. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of surrender, or acceptance.\u201d",
      "Eight years ago many top tech executives treated Trump as something of a curiosity. Meetings with him were more perfunctory and for show. Relationships soon worsened. Trump stridently criticized Bezos and the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post. Zuckerberg, too, was a frequent target, including last year, when Trump threatened him with \u201clife in prison\u201d if he did anything Trump viewed as illegal during the campaign. Both men have met privately with Trump in recent weeks, as have Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and former Alphabet President Sergey Brin.",
      "A source close to Trump said tech executives like Zuckerberg and Bezos are \u201csmart to play ball\u201d with him in a way they weren\u2019t eight years ago.",
      "\u201cThey know the anti-Trump side lost, and they know if they aren\u2019t playing nice with him, he\u2019ll try to bust them up,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a mix of fear, a mix of times-are-changing.\u201d",
      "A Republican operative close to Trump\u2019s circle described corporate America\u2019s response to the 2024 election as the exact inverse of its response after 2016.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that culturally, [Meta] and other companies feel like \u2018You know what? We actually don\u2019t need to be bullied by activists anymore,\u2019\u201d the operative said.",
      "Against that backdrop, intense disputes have broken out at a number of leading news organizations, including Bezos\u2019 Post as the newsroom navigates Trump\u2019s return to power.",
      "The Post, even though its editorial page staff drafted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, declined back a presidential candidate \u2014 a widely criticized decision that sources attributed to Bezos \u2014 just two weeks before the election. Last week, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit the paper after editors refused to publish her drawing depicting Bezos and other corporate leaders bending the knee to Trump. The Post\u2019s editorial page editor said the cartoon was rejected because the content was too similar to a recent column and that the decision was not a \u201creflection of a malign force.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, prompted resignations last year when he killed his editorial board\u2019s planned endorsement of Harris. Soon-Shiong has since proposed instituting a \u201cbias meter\u201d to evaluate the paper\u2019s published opinions while trying to steer a more moderate direction.",
      "At broadcast and cable outlets, there has been turmoil, too. ABC paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit with Trump. And at MSNBC, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who have been known for their critical stance toward Trump in recent years, traveled to his Mar-a-Lago resort to meet with him after the election. Both episodes drew some criticism. While ABC did not elaborate on its decision to settle the suit, Scarborough and Brzezinski have defended their meeting with Trump as a useful reporting trip that helped inform their viewers.",
      "\u2018No one\u2019s quite sure what to do\u2019",
      "For Democrats, this is a confusing time. Many state-level leaders say they will find areas to work together with the administration while they push back against efforts they believe are harmful. In Congress, Democrats have expressed openness to some of Trump\u2019s more controversial Cabinet selections, like his pick for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Others signed onto a Republican-backed immigration bill that advanced in the Senate on Thursday, the Laken Riley Act, which would allow the Department of Homeland Security to detain noncitizens who are charged with certain crimes.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s quite sure what to do,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything yet that shows me anybody\u2019s quite ready for this.\u201d",
      "Democrats, including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, have even expressed openness to Trump\u2019s calls to annex Greenland or rename the Gulf of Mexico \u2014\u00a0if other conditions are met first. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has expressed more openness to Trump than his Democratic colleagues, announced Thursday that he will soon meet with Trump, becoming the first sitting Democratic senator to do so since Trump won last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary to commit to cooperation with him at this point,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to gain from that.\u201d",
      "In a video posted to social media on Thursday, many Senate Democrats laid out their posture entering a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe are not here because of who we are against,\u201d the senators read. \u201cWe are here because of who we are for. \u2026 We are here to fight for Americans. We will work with anyone if they want to make life better for you. But if Donald Trump and Senate Republicans do things to hurt you, we will fight.\u201d",
      "The Republican operative close to Trump\u2019s circle said it\u2019s clear that this time around the Democratic response is \u201c100% different\u201d from what it was after Trump\u2019s 2016 win.",
      "\u201cThe resistance is dead,\u201d this person said. \u201cThere is no resistance anymore.\u201d",
      "But without Trump\u2019s even having taken office yet, some Democrats say it\u2019s far too soon to write off the anti-Trump opposition. Once he begins enacting policies, Democrats and outside allies will have more to push back on.",
      "Amanda Litman, a co-founder and the president of Run for Something, a grassroots progressive candidate recruitment group, said more than 12,000 people have signed up to run for offices since Trump\u2019s victory, a number she said nearly matched the total number of people who signed up in 2017, its launch year.",
      "\u201cA lot of the big \u2018resistance\u2019 stuff didn\u2019t really start happening until after Trump actually took office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels really early to say the resistance is fake or is dead. I think it\u2019ll look different. I think it\u2019ll feel different.\u201d",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans also urged caution on the olive branches and calls for bipartisanship Democrats have offered in recent weeks, noting that after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, Schumer also laid out areas in which the incoming administration and Democratic leaders could work together \u2014\u00a0an effort that in no way stunted the anti-Trump backlash.",
      "But for Democrats who were working in Washington during Trump\u2019s last transition, there was acknowledgment that something very different is happening now \u2014\u00a0and that there is a wider array of policies Democrats will be more likely to work with Trump and his allies on, with the Laken Riley Act serving as an early example.",
      "\u201cThere is an openness here this time that just did not exist last time,\u201d said the senior aide to a Democratic senator. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s especially [true] on immigration.\u201d",
      "This person said the driving force was the election itself. Democrats viewed 2016 as \u201ca freak accident\u201d compared with 2024, amounting to having \u201cflat-out lost.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe got to sit here in the corner for a little bit until they start doing their thing, and we\u2019ll figure out our footing from that point,\u201d this person said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any agreement on what Democrats should be doing right now.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Democrats will stand by idly during, say, Trump\u2019s mass deportation effort, as a former senior staff member for Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden said. This person said China policy, infrastructure, drug pricing and reshoring manufacturing are all policy areas in which Democrats will seek to work with Trump while fighting \u201ctooth and nail against mass deportations\u201d or any efforts to \u201cweaponize\u201d the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cThe party is going through a moment of disbelief that they lost,\u201d this person said.",
      "It\u2019s even trickier at the state level, where many of the Democratic Party\u2019s top presidential prospects reside. Governors including Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Gavin Newsom in California \u2014 whom Trump has spent days blaming for devastating wildfires around Los Angeles \u2014 Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania and JB Pritzker in Illinois try to toe a fine line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all working together, obviously, but there\u2019s a little bit of an island\u201d for each governor, said a senior aide to a Democratic governor. \u201cObviously Pritzker\u2019s got the safeguarding democracy thing. Gavin Newsom is calling special sessions. I think everybody\u2019s trying to individually find their path forward, to be unique in a way that doesn\u2019t draw unnecessary attention but highlights that you know they care about their own particular state.\u201d",
      "Democratic pollster John Anzalone said newfound bipartisanship \u201cis a winning equation for everyone\u201d in this moment, particularly at the state level. He praised remarks by Whitmer.",
      "\u201cLook at Whitmer, she basically said Trump loves Michigan, too, and we will work with him to get done what is needed for Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to stand up when he is wrong and just as important to come together and get things done.\u201d",
      "But that approach has roiled some on the left, who struggle to believe Democrats can be taking such a wait-and-see approach to a president whose actions and governance aren\u2019t mysteries.",
      "\u201cTo see some Democrats saying, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just wait and see\u2019 \u2014 no, we actually don\u2019t need to wait and see,\u201d said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a progressive grassroots group. \u201cWe have the better part of a decade of evidence and all his campaign promises to tell us what he intends to do.\u201d"

      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an exclusive interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which are uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:29:11 GMT",
    "summary": "After lawyers for TikTok defended the app to the Supreme Court and received a skeptical reception, it seems that there are only a few pathways left for the app.",
    "story": [
      "After lawyers for TikTok appeared before the Supreme Court on Friday and received a skeptical reception, it seems only a few pathways remain for the platform\u2019s future in the U.S.",
      "If the Supreme Court votes to uphold the law that President Joe Biden signed in April, TikTok will shut down on Jan. 19, the day before Donald Trump takes office. The law requires TikTok to divest from its Chinese ownership and sell to a U.S. company. If the justices declare the law unconstitutional, TikTok can continue to exist as it is today for its 170 million American users \u2014 around half of the U.S. population.",
      "But the direction of Friday\u2019s oral arguments put that possibility into question.",
      "There are a few factors that could play into other options. TikTok has asked to extend the timeline of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, a choice the justices can make to push back their final judgment. Trump has supported TikTok, filing an amicus brief in December to the Supreme Court to advocate for such an extension, which would bring the sale deadline into his presidential term. An extension, he said, would allow his administration (which is divided on TikTok) to pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d for the app\u2019s future.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely clear what form that would take.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s options would be to grant a 90-day extension for TikTok to continue its effort to find an American buyer \u2014 a provision specifically written into the law forcing a sale. However, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance said it will not approve a sale of the app. If ByteDance were to approve a sale, there are U.S. buyers willing to purchase TikTok, including billionaire business executive Frank McCourt.",
      "Gautam Hans, a professor of law at Cornell University, said TikTok had \u201ca tough go\u201d with the Supreme Court and added he finds it unlikely that the justices will side with the platform. He called Trump\u2019s brief \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said that it\u2019s unclear how Trump will seek a political resolution, with a few unlikely possibilities.",
      "\u201cThere might be a possibility that he pressures Congress to rescind the law,\u201d Hans said. \u201cThat would be pretty extraordinary, given that the law passed on a partisan basis overwhelmingly. You\u2019d have to have a lot of reversals from legislators to undo the law.\u201d",
      "Hans said that Trump could also direct the Justice Department not to enforce the law, meaning that it would not prosecute Google and Apple\u2019s app stores for hosting the app. But Hans didn\u2019t think that the legal counsel for either company would be comfortable defying the law on Trump\u2019s word alone.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the U.S. government\u2019s position on TikTok to the Supreme Court, indicated during her argument that she believes ByteDance could pivot to selling the company if the law is upheld.",
      "\u201cI think Congress expects we might see something like a game of chicken, ByteDance saying we can\u2019t do it, China will never let us do it,\u201d Prelogar said in court on Friday. \u201cBut when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance will consider, and it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.\u201d",
      "Rita McGrath, the academic director in executive education at Columbia Business School, said that buyers like McCourt are betting that TikTok will decide to sell to a U.S. owner after all, if the company is left with no other options.",
      "\u201cIf they do get shut down, which seems to be likely, I think it opens up a second tier of bargaining possibilities,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cTikTok has taken the time - since the law was passed until these court hearings - to not investigate buyers, to not investigate an alternative, to not look into whatever legal remedies they might have. They\u2019ve been going on a lobbying and charm offensive. This is kind of a Hail Mary for them.\u201d",
      "McGrath said that whether TikTok sells or not, she believes creators will be able to transition to alternatives. Platforms like Meta, with Instagram Reels, and Google, with YouTube Shorts, would see an advantage in the short-form video space if TikTok disappears. Still, McGrath said it would be a \u201closs\u201d for the people who have built up large, profitable and influential TikTok followings.",
      "\u201cUsers have real interests here. They are using the platform to communicate, to share content, to discuss, to make money. Shutting this down is going to be a major social, political and economic consequence for those individuals, not just the company,\u201d Hans said. \u201cSo that is what I think is going to be really challenging from a First Amendment perspective, the rights and interests of the users, which are really important given there are over 170 million of them in this country that are going to be affected in ways that can\u2019t easily be fixed.\u201d"

      "Ohio State clung to a 21-14 lead late in the fourth quarter when Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, eight yards from a tying score, fumbled the ball under pressure from Jack Sawyer, an Ohio State defensive end who roomed with Ewers three years earlier as freshmen in Columbus. Sawyer returned the fumble 83 yards for a touchdown and 28-14 lead with just more than two minutes remaining in the game.",
      "\"I felt [Sawyer], I started drifting away, thought I was going to be able to get the ball off before he got there,\" Ewers told reporters. \"But you know, I saw Jack running with the ball down the sideline. And you know, it sucks, man.\u201d",

      "Texas trailed 7-0, and 14-7, only to tie the score each time behind one of the country's top defenses, which held star Ohio State wideout Jeremiah Smith to just one catch for three yards. Ewers finished with 283 passing yards and two touchdowns, to go with his interception, while completing 23 of his 39 passes.",
      "Ohio State quarterback Will Howard, 0-3 in his career against Texas while playing at Kansas State, finally beat the Longhorns while passing for 289 yards, with one touchdown \u2014 a screen pass just seconds before halftime that TreVeyon Henderson turned into a 75-yard score \u2014 and an interception."

It remains flimsy and prone to breakdowns as outdated fossil fuel plants continue working way past their lifespan to power the grid, and distribution cables fail to transmit electricity. These have caused power outages to become longer and more recurrent.",
      "It took 40 years to build the grid Hurricane Maria destroyed in one day, Sergio Marxuach, policy director of the Puerto Rico-based think tank Center For A New Economy, told NBC News. \"I'm not saying it will take 40 more years to fix it, but the magnitude of the work we have to do is huge.\"",
      "In 2022, exactly five years after Maria, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Fiona. Since then, more than 200 outages have been reported in the U.S. territory due to lack of systems that provide backup energy when the grid fails, according to exiting U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.",
      "\"Band-Aid solutions aren't going to cut it,\" Granholm said in a news conference in Puerto Rico Friday morning. \"Progress is being made and more progress needs to be made.\"",
      "Even though much of the work ahead will fall on the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, Granholm said that under President Joe Biden, \"the ground has been set\" to improve Puerto Rico's grid and transition to renewable energy.",
      "Most of the funds allocated to rebuild the electrical grid, about $17 billion, are coming from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A little over a third of that money, about $6 billion, has been designated to than 200 projects to improve the grid. At least 125 of those are already under construction in partnership with Luma Energy and Genera PR, the private company in charge of power generation, Granholm said.",
      "The secretary said her office assisted Puerto Rico in its race to comply with\u00a0local policies\u00a0that seek to achieve\u00a0100% renewable\u00a0electricity by 2050. Under the Biden administration, Puerto Rico increased its capacity to generate power from renewable energy from less than 4% to 6%.",
      "But great challenges remain ahead as officials in Puerto Rico struggle to simultaneously coordinate short-term repairs to stabilize power services with the grid's long-term reconstruction and a transition to renewable energy sources.",
      "New Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez campaigned on the promise to fix the issue that has been plaguing the U.S. territory. In one of her first acts in office, Gonz\u00e1lez named engineer Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n as the new \u201cenergy czar.\u201d While also serving as director of the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority, Col\u00f3n will serve as the point person in charge of coordinating herculean efforts to improve and rebuild the power grid.",
      "Marxuach, the think tank director, pointed out that it's still unclear what kind of budget and resources will be provided to Col\u00f3n.",
      "Stabilizing the grid and reducing the number of outages in the short-term should still be the top priority, Marxuach said. For this, additional sources of energy need to be added to the grid. Genera PR and Luma Energy plan to install more electric backup units to provide temporary power when the grid fails. They also plan on installing new electrical transformers, as well as repairing several substations in the next 18 months.",
      "Granholm said the Department of Energy \"added 350 megawatts of temporary generation to provide additional backups, but we need to do more.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the grid needs to be fully reconstructed for Puerto Rico to have reliable power in the long term. That process started under Trump's first presidential term. The administration then notoriously blocked Puerto Rico from receiving aid and implemented additional requirements that slowed down the disbursement of reconstruction funds. It remains to be seen if any of these practices will be brought back after Trump takes office for a second time.",
      "A combination of a multitude of factors, Marxuach said, \"have converged so that we will continue, in 2025, to have a system that is still fragile.\""

There has been a great deal of speculation about what exactly the government was investigating and what the outcome would be. As today\u2019s resolution shows, much of that speculation was misguided and misleading.\u00a0In the end, there was never anything more to this than minor accounting errors with regard to some personal payments that I made several years ago while I was CEO of WWE.

      "On an episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" released Friday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg painted a picture of Biden administration officials berating Facebook staff during requests to remove certain content from the social media platform.",
      "\"Basically, these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse,\" Zuckerberg told podcast host and comedian Joe Rogan. \"It just got to this point where we were like, 'No, we're not gonna, we're not gonna take down things that are true. That's ridiculous.'\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment about Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks.",
      "It's not the first time that the co-founder of Facebook has said administration officials pressured the company to remove posts.",
      "In a letter last year to Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg said that the White House \u201crepeatedly pressured\u201d Facebook to remove \u201ccertain COVID-19 content including humor and satire.\u201d",
      "Zuckerberg said Facebook, which is owned by Meta, acquiesced at times, while suggesting that different decisions would be made going forward. He said the company \"made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn\u2019t make today.\"",
      "The White House responded at the time in a statement saying: \u201cWhen confronted with a deadly pandemic, this Administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety. Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\u201d",
      "On Rogan's show, Zuckerberg said the administration had asked Facebook to remove from its platform a meme that showed actor Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a TV screen advertising a class action lawsuit for people who once took the Covid vaccine.",

      "That meme was included as evidence in an amicus brief filed by congressional Republicans in a case that made it to the Supreme Court in 2023.",
      "In that case, plaintiffs, which included Louisiana, Missouri and several Facebook users who had posts removed or downgraded, sought to bar government officials from communicating with social media companies.",
      "The Supreme Court ultimately threw out the lawsuit in a 6-3 ruling, saying in part that there was plenty of evidence of platforms moderating content without government intervention.",
      "\u201cIn fact, the platforms, acting independently, had strengthened their pre-existing content moderation policies before the government defendants got involved,\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote in her opinion.",
      "Zuckerberg\u2019s comments on Rogan's podcast come days after he announced that Meta would end its fact-checking program and replace it with a community-driven structure similar to the Community Notes system on X. He also announced that his platforms \u2014 Facebook and Instagram \u2014 would relax rules related to political content.",
      "Zuckerberg is one of several tech moguls,\u00a0reportedly including Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, whose companies have\u00a0pledged to give $1 million\u00a0to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee."

    "summary": "A company that tracks American location data through smartphones has been hacked by Russian cybercriminals, according to cybersecurity researchers",
    "story": [
      "One of the largest companies that tracks Americans\u2019 location through smartphone data has been hacked by Russian cybercriminals in exchange for ransom, according to two cybersecurity researchers, a person who has posted a massive trove of allegedly hacked files and a notice the company sent to the Norwegian government.",
      "The incident would be one of the largest known breaches of a handful of controversial U.S. companies that sell individuals\u2019 location data, a gold mine for advertisers as it can be used to extensively map a person\u2019s life, usually without their knowledge.",
      "The company, Gravy Analytics, and its subsidiary, Venntel, were accused last month by the Federal Trade Commission of illegally collecting and selling Americans\u2019 location data without their knowledge or obtaining proper legal consent. Some of the people Gravy tracked were monitored going into sensitive locations like government buildings, health clinics and places of worship, the FTC said.",
      "Smartphones create significant data from both how they connect to cell towers and wireless internet providers, as well as through apps, particularly third-party apps that require location data. The ubiquity of smartphones in everyday life has spurred an industry of shadowy companies that buy, package and sell data. While that data is usually advertised to marketers, it\u2019s also sold to governments.",
      "Gravy\u2019s website has been down since at least Tuesday. Emails to it, Venntel and Gravy\u2019s parent company, Unacast, could not be delivered. Several executives at the company contacted by NBC News did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "While the company has not made any public American notice about the alleged breach, Norwegian news outlet NRK has obtained and published a private notification of the breach, that Gravy and Unacast sent to Norway's data protection authority. Unacast maintains an office in Norway.",
      "Gravy noticed unauthorized access to its Amazon Web Services cloud storage on Monday, it said in the notice, and is still investigating it.",
      "Gravy has claimed to \u201ccollect, process and curate\u201d more than 17 billion signals from people\u2019s smartphones every day, according to the FTC\u2019s complaint.",
      "Venntel sells Gravy data on people\u2019s locations to help establish what the online advertising industry calls a \u201cpattern of life.\u201d The companies\u2019 marketing materials give an example of identifying a target\u2019s \u201cbed down location, work location, and visits to other USG [United States Government] buildings,\u201d and can show where people are: \u201chome, gym, evening school, etc,\u201d the complaint says.",
      "On Saturday, a hacker on a popular Russian cybercrime forum called XSS claimed to have hacked Gravy. It posted screenshots and uploaded 17 terabytes of information, a massive trove, as evidence. Writing in Russian, the hacker claimed they would upload more if Gravy didn\u2019t pay an unspecified ransom.",
      "The files have since been removed, but not before they were downloaded and shared among cybersecurity researchers, two of whom analyzed them and said they found them likely authentic.",
      "John Hammond, a researcher at the cybersecurity company Huntress, told NBC News that sorting through the data, he found a database of more than 300,000 individuals\u2019 email addresses. NBC News ran some of those addresses through HaveIBeenPwned, a website that cross-checks email addresses to see if they have been exposed in previous breaches, and found that some of the addresses in the alleged Gravy dump have not been part of other major breaches.",
      "\u201cOrganizations whose sole mission is data collection and aggregation are undoubtedly going to be an attractive target for threat actors. While we don\u2019t know their initial access method, or \u2018how the hackers got in\u2019, it is clear they compromised more than enough to make an impact with this kind of data,\u201d Hammond told NBC News.",
      "Baptiste Robert, the CEO of the French privacy and location data company Predicta Lab, downloaded the sample data and told NBC News that the leaked material appears to show people tracked to around 30 million locations around the world. The data does not explicitly identify people by name or contain other identifying information, but instead follows the data broker industry practice of assigning individuals a string of numbers as a pseudonym, he said.",
      "Though data brokers claim that using advertising ID pseudonyms protects their privacy, researchers have repeatedly shown that location data can make it easy to identify individuals. If data tracking a particular cellphone shows a person who spends most of their nights at a particular address, for example, it\u2019s likely that person owns or rents that home.",
      "The U.S. has no comprehensive federal privacy law, despite privacy advocates and even the Biden administration having called for one. Last year, Duke University researchers found that U.S. service members\u2019 data, including location data, is widely sold by data brokers.",
      "In 2023, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found that U.S. intelligence agencies, which have restrictions on surveilling Americans directly, often purchase data on Americans from brokers and have few guidelines or oversight in that process."

    "story": [
      "Four years after exiting bankruptcy, Chuck E. Cheese is making a comeback, thanks to a dramatic makeover to introduce its games and pizza to a new generation.",
      "In June 2020, just as some states began lifting their pandemic lockdowns, Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s parent company CEC Entertainment\u00a0filed for Chapter 11\u00a0bankruptcy protection. It emerged from bankruptcy months later with new leadership and freed from about $705 million in debt.",
      "Even when Covid subsided, the company faced another existential threat: figuring out how to entertain children \u2014 and their paying parents \u2014 in the age of iPads and smartphones. The company has spent more than $300 million in recent years tackling that challenge \u2014 and the investment has started to pay off.",
      "CEC Entertainment, which also includes Pasqually\u2019s Pizza & Wings and Peter Piper Pizza, has seen eight straight months of same-store sales growth and is no longer in debt, according to CEO Dave McKillips. The company isn\u2019t publicly traded, but it discloses its financial results to its bond investors.",
      "CEC Entertainment\u2019s annual revenue grew from $912 million in 2019 to roughly $1.2 billion in 2023,\u00a0according to Reuters. And that\u2019s with fewer open Chuck E. Cheese locations. The chain has 470 U.S. locations currently, down from 537 in 2019.",
      "Sustaining the growth won\u2019t be easy. Like all restaurants, the chain has to win over consumers who are eating out less often as costs rise. Chuck E. Cheese also has to draw the attention of children and parents in a fragmented media market.",
      "Goodbye, animatronics",
      "Since Atari founder Nolan Bushnell opened its first location in 1977 in San Jose, Chuck E. Cheese has grown to become a staple of many childhoods, known for its pizza, birthday parties and animatronic mouse mascot and band.",
      "After exiting bankruptcy, Chuck E. Cheese and its stores underwent a makeover, giving today\u2019s locations a very different look. Gone are the animatronics, SkyTube tunnels and physical tickets of yore. Instead, trampolines, a mobile app and floor-to-ceiling JumboTrons have replaced them.",
      "Those changes came from McKillips, a former Six Flags executive. He joined the company in January 2020, just months before lockdowns would temporarily shutter all of its locations. By April 2021, the company raised $650 million in bonds, which it\u2019s been spending on its restaurants.",
      "\u201cThe company was capital-starved for many, many years. It had not been remodeled. It had not been touched,\u201d he said.",
      "Apollo Global Management took Chuck E. Cheese private in 2014. Five years later, CEC Entertainment tried to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. But the deal was scrapped without explanation.",
      "The new cash prompted a frank look at the Chuck E. Cheese model \u2014 including its\u00a0iconic animatronic band, featuring Charles Entertainment Cheese and his friends.",
      "\u201cWe pulled out the animatronics. It was a hot debate for many legacy bands, but kids were consuming entertainment in such a different way, you know, growing up with screens and ever-changing bite-sized entertainment,\u201d McKillips said.",
      "The chain also redid its menu, upgrading to scratch-made pizzas. Kidz Bop became an official music partner. Other kid-friendly brands, like Paw Patrol, Marvel and Nickelodeon, became partners for its games.",
      "And then came the trampolines.",
      "\u201cWe found one glaring opportunity for us \u2026 active play,\u201d McKillips said. He added that growth in the family entertainment category is largely coming from activity-based businesses, like trampoline parks and rock-climbing walls.",
      "The company first tested the trampolines in Brooklyn and then in Miami, St. Louis and Orlando. As of December, 450 Chuck E. Cheese locations now have kid-sized trampolines. And unlike the SkyTubes or ball pits of the past, customers have to pay extra to use trampolines. (The ball pits disappeared from Chuck E. Cheese locations in 2011, while SkyTubes lasted roughly another decade.)",
      "After the company spent $230 million to remodel Chuck E. Cheese locations, McKillips now says that process is finished.",
      "\u201cWe needed to fix the product. The product is fixed,\u201d he said.",
      "Subscription spenders",
      "Reintroducing customers to the brand \u2014 especially adults who only know the Chuck E. Cheese of their own childhoods \u2014 has been another focus.",
      "\u201cYou come in around three years old, you leave around eight or nine and you don\u2019t come back for 15 years. We had to go and speak to a whole new generation of kids, and we were off-air during Covid. We had to build all that,\u201d McKillips said.",
      "For example, Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s birthday business, one of the company\u2019s best marketing tools, struggled in the wake of the pandemic. Today, it\u2019s back at pre-pandemic levels.",
      "And as Chuck E. Cheese started seeing the pullback in consumer spending that hit many restaurants last year, from McDonald\u2019s to Outback Steakhouse, the chain had to come up with a way to appeal to the value-oriented customer.",
      "Over the summer, Chuck E. Cheese launched a two-month tiered subscription program that offered unlimited visits and discounts on food, drinks and games. The membership encouraged families to visit more often than the typical two or three annual visits. The subscription starts at $7.99 a month, with additional tiers at $11.99 and $29.99 that promise steeper discounts and more games played.",
      "\u201cIn 2023, we sold 79,000 passes. This year, we sold close to 400,000 passes during the same time period,\u201d McKillips said, referring to 2024. \u201cThis shows that the value consumer will seek and will spend if they\u2019re getting great return on their spend.\u201d",
      "In the fall, the company followed up on the success of the passes with a 12-month membership and has already sold more than 100,000 of them.",
      "An entertainment empire?",
      "McKillips\u2019 biggest dreams for the chain and its mascots lie outside of the four walls of its restaurants.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s another cute mouse down in Orlando that does this pretty well, so I see us in the same way, but we\u2019re just getting started right now,\u201d McKillips said.",
      "In addition to 30 licensing deals for everything from frozen pizzas to apparel, Chuck E. Cheese is also exploring different entertainment partnerships that would make its mouse mascot a starring character, according to McKillips.",
      "And that\u2019s not all. The company has looked into the possibility of a game show. It has a\u00a0prolific YouTube channel, with videos focused on its characters, not its pizza or games.",
      "Plus, Chuck E. Cheese himself has six albums available on streaming platforms, and his band plays live, choreographed concerts.",

      "McDonald\u2019s\u00a0will shutter three locations of its drinks-focused\u00a0spinoff brand, CosMc\u2019s.",
      "To test the concept, the fast-food giant opened its\u00a0first CosMc\u2019s location\u00a0more than a year ago in the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook, followed by six more in Texas. McDonald\u2019s has converted larger namesake restaurants into CosMc\u2019s, in addition to building smaller prototype locations.",
      "The smaller stores work better for the test, the company said Thursday. As a result, McDonald\u2019s will close three of its larger format CosMc\u2019s locations and open two more small Texas restaurants. The company didn\u2019t disclose the locations for either the openings or closures, although CosMc\u2019s website says a store is coming soon to Allen, Texas.",
      "McDonald\u2019s also shared other early learnings from the pilot on Thursday. Savory hash browns are the top-selling food \u2014 at any time of day \u2014 followed by McPops, the chain\u2019s mini filled doughnuts. Best-selling drinks include the Island Pick Me Up Punch, Churro Cold Brew Frappe and the Sour Energy Burst.",
      "The CosMc\u2019s test will continue for the \u201cforeseeable future,\u201d according to the company.",
      "McDonald\u2019s created CosMc\u2019s as its entry point into the growing \u201cafternoon beverage pick-me-up occasion.\u201d",
      "While CosMc\u2019s menu features some McDonald\u2019s classics, it also offers a host of new items playing off other beverage and snacking trends, like its iced turmeric spiced lattes, tropical spiceade and pretzel bites.\u00a0Starbucks,\u00a0Dutch Bros.\u00a0and bubble tea chain Kung Fu Tea have found success with younger consumers by offering customizable cold drinks.",
      "The name for the new brand comes from CosMc, a McDonaldland mascot that appeared in advertisements in the late 1980s and early 1990s. CosMc is an alien from outer space who craves McDonald\u2019s food.",
      "While it\u2019s unclear just how much McDonald\u2019s plans to grow CosMc\u2019s, it\u2019s still a miniscule part of the burger giant\u2019s overall U.S. footprint.

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 16:38:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery have called off plans to launch their sports streaming service, Venu, the companies said in a joint statement Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Disney,\u00a0Fox\u00a0and\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery\u00a0have called off plans to launch their sports streaming service, Venu, the companies said in a joint statement Friday.",
      "\u201cAfter careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,\u201d they said in the statement. \u201cIn an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels. We are proud of the work that has been done on Venu to date and grateful to the Venu staff, whom we will support through this transition period.\u201d",
      "Venu was\u00a0first announced in February\u00a0and intended to combine the live sports assets of Fox, WBD and Disney-owned ESPN. It was initially slated to launch before the start of the NFL season in September, but was\u00a0delayed in part\u00a0by a\u00a0legal challenge from internet TV bundler Fubo,\u00a0which claimed the platform would be anticompetitive.",
      "Together Disney, Fox and WBD control more than 50% of all U.S. sports media rights, and at least 60% of all nationally broadcast U.S. sports rights, according to the judge on the antitrust case.",
      "The news that it would not launch came as a shock to Venu employees, who found out late Thursday night, according to people familiar with the matter. They believed they had a pathway forward to launch the service after Disney\u00a0agreed earlier this week\u00a0to merge its Hulu+ Live TV with\u00a0Fubo, settling all litigation over Venu.",
      "But the judge\u2019s response in Fubo\u2019s lawsuit questioned the legality of cable bundling in general, prompting Disney to strike the deal with Fubo, through which Disney would take 70% control of the resulting company. And two days ago, satellite providers DirecTV and Dish sent letters to federal court arguing that the legal questions brought up by the judge remained unanswered.",
      "Rather than risk an extended lawsuit that could jeopardize bundling in general \u2014 including Disney\u2019s efforts to bundle its own streaming entities (ESPN, Hulu and Disney+) \u2014 the three companies decided to pull the plug on Venu, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s decisions.",

      "Disney\u2019s deal with Fubo, along with the company\u2019s recent carriage renewal with DirecTV, also gives the company new ways to package so-called skinny bundles \u2014 narrower selections of channels for less money.

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The largest wildfire to hit Los Angeles this week rapidly tore through homes and communities, whipped by winds that sent embers skyward.",
    "story": [
      "A little after midnight on New Year\u2019s Day, Francine Sohn was jolted awake by a phone call from a neighbor, who sounded hysterical. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire on the hill,\u201d the neighbor told her.",
      "Sohn, 72, looked outside and saw a small brush fire perilously close to her Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles. She watched firefighters douse the flames, waiting to see if she should flee. But there was no need: the wind was a brisk but manageable 15 mph, and the fire was contained before dawn with no homes damaged and no one hurt.",
      "A week later, the same thing happened: another small fire spotted in the same area. But this one turned into a monster.",
      "The Palisades Fire, now one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history, began in the backyard of Palisades Highlands, a secluded and well-to-do community overlooking the coast between Malibu and Santa Monica. Residents and hikers first saw it as a modest brush fire looming in the parched scrubland.",
      "But whipped by winds that hit 60 mph, the flames rapidly rolled over the mountainside and roared through neighborhoods, growing to more than 20,000 acres and consuming more than 5,000 structures. It is now one of six wildfires burning simultaneously in Los Angeles County that have forced 180,000 people from their homes and left at least 11 dead.",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly a dozen people who witnessed the Palisades Fire\u2019s early stages on the morning of Jan. 7 and watched it grow and move faster than any they had ever seen, leaving a path of ruin they did not think possible \u2014 even in a place where wildfires are a part of life.",
      "Sohn was already on edge that morning after seeing authorities\u2019 warnings that dry winter winds were forecast across drought-parched Los Angeles, raising the risk of wildfires.",
      "Then, as she set out from her home on Piedra Morada Drive for a 10:30 a.m. art class at the local recreation center, a neighbor shouted at her from across the street. She looked behind his house and saw fire in the brush less than a mile off. The neighbor\u2019s family had already called 911.",
      "Sohn didn\u2019t wait for anyone to tell her to evacuate.",
      "\u201cI ran in the house, woke up my friend, threw my dog in the car along with as many photo albums I could carry,\u201d she said, \u201cand hightailed it out of there.\u201d",
      "Up in the brush at about the same time, Beni Oren was on a trail run with friends near Skull Rock, a local landmark, when they smelled smoke. They turned and confronted flames about 100 feet away, Oren, 24, said.",
      "They ran in a panic, changing directions as they realized the wind was blowing the fire their way. A widening plume of smoke rose above the canyon as they got to safety. \u201cIt was a bizarre experience realizing like, f---, is all this about to be on fire?\u201d Oren said.",
      "Firefighters soon raced in, sirens blaring. On radios, they described it as a 10-acre brush fire on a ridgeline, and they planned to deploy aircraft to soak the rising flames. It was just after 10:30 a.m. The danger was already clear.",
      "\u201cIt is 100% in alignment with the wind. It has the potential for 200-plus acres in the next 20 minutes,\u201d one person reported over the Los Angeles County Fire Department\u2019s radio, according to a recording.\u00a0\u201cWe have a potential for structures being threatened in the next 20 minutes.\u201d",
      "Someone responded: \u201cIt is pushing directly towards Palisades.\u201d A few seconds later, he added: \u201cThis thing is going to make a good run.\u201d",
      "Alarmed residents of the Palisades Highlands, watching the growing fire from their backyards and decks, were coming to the same conclusion.",
      "Stephanie Libonati was at home with her mother and brother on Piedra Morada Drive when she saw flames and smoke about three-quarters of a mile away and screamed, \u201cFire!\u201d Her mother called 911, then Libonati and her brother ran outside to alert neighbors. They began packing up their photographs, passports and other valuables and made a plan: leave in three separate cars, meet up outside of town, then continue to her grandfather\u2019s ranch in Santa Clarita.",
      "By the time they headed out, the fire looked twice as big, Libonati, 26, said. Firefighters had arrived as well, telling her brother to stop soaking their back deck and get out of there.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a fire pit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could hear fire crackling and everything burning. And the smell was awful, ash blowing in our faces. It was just so fast. You kept seeing it spread and spread.\u201d",
      "Once they started driving, the family immediately got separated, their paths interrupted by flames and traffic and panic. As she drove through Palisades Village, a shopping district at the bottom of the hill, Libonati saw people on the side of the road filming the inferno above. \u201cNo one would ever expect the fire to come down to the village,\u201d she said. \u201cIt never has.\u201d",
      "They eventually met up, hugged, and continued to the ranch.",
      "The exodus continued, turning from a trickle into a mad rush. Palisades Drive, the single main road leading directly down the hill to Sunset Boulevard, was jammed with cars. Some tried Fire Road, an alternate evacuation route during emergencies, but before long that passage was surrounded by flames, residents said. Sunset slowed to a standstill.",
      "Many panicked drivers abandoned their cars in the road and took off on foot, forcing emergency crews to bulldoze the vehicles aside so that fire trucks could get through. Firefighters told residents in some parts of the neighborhood to stay put temporarily because there wasn\u2019t initially an imminent danger and there was no easy way out.",
      "The winds kicked up, engorging the flames and pushing embers into the air and down farther away, where they ignited new hot spots. The fire consumed the mountainside and swept through the Highlands, the village and the rest of the Pacific Palisades, then west along the coast to Malibu.",
      "Colin Fields and Vanita Borwankar, who live off Palisades Drive, set off in their car after receiving a text alert about potential evacuations. By the time they left their condo at 11 a.m., the fire was moving downhill, but the gridlock forced them to turn around. They headed back up the hill to Fields\u2019 parents\u2019 home at the edge of the canyon, where Fields and his brother sprayed hoses at encroaching flames and flagged flare-ups to firefighters."

      "It\u2019s a feat Jenkins \u2014 who co-wrote \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d with Rachel Morrison while editing his 2016 Oscar-winning film \u201cMoonlight\u201d \u2014 could never have planned. On the surface, the two films appear to have little in common.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d the big-budget Disney release, has a huge cultural imprint thanks to 1994\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d which became one of the most profitable films of all time with acting legend James Earl Jones voicing Mufasa. In contrast, \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d a biopic about Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields, the first American woman to earn a gold medal in boxing, is a decidedly smaller picture.",
      "Jenkins told NBC News that the arc of the main character, \u201cwho has to go on this journey to self-actualize,\u201d is what attracted him most to \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d in its early development stage. It\u2019s a theme, he said, \u201cI realize now is so present in my work.\u201d",
      "As Jenkins continues to grow as a filmmaker while also broadening the scope of the stories Hollywood tells and who is at their center, his themes explore the journey to oneself, as well as the values of community and \u201cfound family,\u201d even in his global blockbuster.",
      "What \u201cgrabbed\u201d Jenkins about Mufasa was that the character was known in the original \u201cLion King\u201d as \u201cthis great leader, this perfect father, the perfect king, and we assume that he is that way because of the character traits he inherited. I think decontextualizing that and showing that just like Claressa Shields, or just like the character in \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 that he came from this other place, and through learning from his community, through really wonderful nurturing by a woman who is essentially his foster mother.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Southern California residents facing losses from this week\u2019s Los Angeles-area fires are beginning to confront their next challenge: filing an insurance claim.",
    "story": [
      "Southern California residents facing losses from this week\u2019s Los Angeles-area fires are beginning to confront their next challenge: filing an insurance claim.",
      "Though mainstream insurers garnered headlines last year for declining to write any new policies in the state amid growing fire threats, they still retain tens of thousands of pre-existing customers who may have been affected.",
      "And while public claims adjusters \u2014 who are privately hired by consumers looking to avoid insurance companies\u2019 adjusters \u2014 are warning that it can take years for claims to be resolved, California residents do enjoy some benefits not seen elsewhere.",
      "The primary benefit is that all California property insurers must immediately pay out a minimum of one-third of the estimated value of a policyholder\u2019s personal belongings, as well as a minimum of four months\u2019 worth of rent for the local area in which they live.",
      "Still, insurance industry experts are warning homeowners to expect to negotiate between the carrier, the claims adjuster and contractors for recouping losses and rebuilding \u2014 and that the ultimate payout for a home that has been damaged or totaled may be less than what policyholders thought they were getting.",
      "\u201cThink of it like a business transaction,\u201d said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a group that advocates on behalf of consumers. \u201cGive your insurance company the chance to do the right thing, but don\u2019t be a pushover, and have your eyes open. No one\u2019s going to come in with a magic wand.\u201d",
      "First steps",
      "Most insurance companies now let policyholders file claims online or even via mobile apps.",
      "However, they vary in the amount of documentation required. Experts say the documentation process will be key to recouping losses \u2014\u00a0and that many companies have become aggressive in determining what ultimately gets covered.",
      "To ensure the maximum payout, experts recommend taking detailed videos and photographs of the damage sustained, as well as compiling receipts for both items lost or damaged as well as purchases made while a policyholder is displaced. Don\u2019t throw anything away until the insurer has signed off on doing so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to be very thorough and get everything accounted for,\u201d said Janet Ruiz, the strategic communications director for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the insurance industry.",
      "Settling loss claims might also require reconstructing how a home looked before it was damaged or destroyed. Experts thus also recommend creating a photo album that contains images of a home\u2019s interior and exterior.",
      "Policyholders should also take detailed notes of any and all conversations they have throughout the process \u2014 names, dates and phone numbers.",
      "Getting paid",
      "While California carriers offer cash advances to get through temporary displacements, the payout amounts are often at depreciated values of the belongings, Ruiz said.",
      "As for payouts on damaged or totaled dwellings themselves, some long-term policyholders may find that while the value of their home had recently been climbing, they had not been paying for the equivalent amount of insurance.",
      "Thus, rebuilding their home back to or beyond its predisaster market value may prove difficult.",
      "On the other hand, some select policies contain what are known as \u201cextended replacement cost\u201d clauses, which allow policyholders to recoup the at-market cost of rebuilding a home.",
      "Still, insurers have become aggressive in rejecting certain claims, especially for partial damage in which smoke, ash and char may have been contributing factors, Bach said.",
      "All affected residents should also apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration assistance, though many will not qualify because they exceed income thresholds, Bach said.",
      "If you had no insurance",
      "If an individual recently bought a new home with cash, was kicked off a policy, or simply couldn\u2019t afford insurance, there are still options available.",
      "FEMA has already begun providing temporary assistance options, and the Small Business Administration is now taking applications for loans to homeowners; contrary to its name, the SBA provides assistance even to individuals who did not own businesses."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an exclusive interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which are uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love the term \u2018repotting.\u2019 It\u2019s like you\u2019re pulled up by your very roots, your foundation, everything that grounds you, and your roots are in the air and you\u2019re scared. \u2018Where am I going to land?\u2019\u201d she told Jenna Bush Hager on the show Oct. 25.",
      "Hoda used the term in her final message during her farewell celebration. As the show wrapped, Hoda was seen driving off in a minivan alongside her daughters, Haley and Hope, with a \u201cJust Married\u201d style note on the back of the car: \u201cJust repotted.\u201d",
      "Hoda has also said that her next chapter may also involve work in the wellness space. She told Jenna on the Oct. 25 show that she was inspired by her own journey to prioritize her mind, body and spirit.",
      "\u201cI tried different things, and I noticed my body was calmer,\u201d she said. \u201cI was getting sick less. I was feeling better. I was a better parent, a better friend, a better sister, a better daughter, and I thought, \u2018All these tiny things I was doing, day after day, were helping to change me inside.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to work in that space,\u201d she added. \u201cI want to start things. I\u2019ve got things that are percolating inside that I\u2019m going to hopefully have fully formed soon.\u201d"

    "summary": "Why is Robbie Williams a monkey in the biopic Better Man? The pop star opened up about the decision and the director explained why. Here is the meaning.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.K., Robbie Williams is a major megastar \u2014 and has been for decades. But not so much in the U.S. For whatever reason, Williams\u2019 charming, edgy pop tunes and self-deprecating sense of humor never have quite clicked with Americans.",
      "That might change with the new biopic about Williams, \u201cBetter Man,\u201d which first opened in theaters on Dec. 25 but is about to go wide on Jan. 17.",
      "Following the beats of a classic biopic, \"Better Man\" has a major twist: Williams \u2014 who voices and sings the character \u2014 is portrayed as a computer-generated chimpanzee.",
      "Let\u2019s find out why.",
      "Who is Robbie Williams?",
      "Williams, now 50, got his start in a big boy band that debuted in the 1990s called Take That. They were huge in the U.K., and still rock out today with three members (but not Williams).",
      "Williams left in 1995 and went solo, releasing his debut album, \u201cLife thru a Lens\u201d in 1997. His single \u201cAngels\u201d was a hit in the U.K., but only charted at No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. \u2014 though it\u2019s since been covered by artists ranging from Jessica Simpson to Josh Groban.",
      "Williams has since gone on release 14 studio albums, with seven No. 1 singles in the U.K., and broke a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in one day to his \u201cClose Encounters Tour.\u201d",
      "His life hasn\u2019t been all broken records and chart-toppers. He\u2019s had to overcome mental health issues and addictions over the years, as the movie depicts.",
      "He is now married to the American actor Ayda Field and they live in Los Angeles with their four children.",
      "What is \u2018Better Man\u2019?",
      "\"Better Man\" is a live-action biopic about Williams in which he's portrayed as a chimpanzee, unlike everyone else in the film. No characters comment on his appearance, however.",
      "The movie follows his story of great fame and great talent, battling with emotional pain, illness and estrangement with his father.",
      "Williams is his own narrator and singer in the film, while Jonno Davies plays the chimp form. The movie is directed by Michael Gracey, who also directed Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron in 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Showman.\u201d",
      "Weta FX, the special effects team behind the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d reboots, are behind the movie magic.",
      "Why is Robbie Williams an ape in \u2018Better Man\u2019?",
      "First off, let\u2019s be clear: Chimpanzees are not monkeys \u2014 even if that's the word often used to describe the \"Better Man\" character. Chimps are apes. (The quickest way to tell between an ape and a monkey? Whether the animal has a tail. Apes don't have them; monkeys generally do)",
      "As to why Williams is a chimp? Well, it\u2019s a metaphor.",
      "In a promotional video where Williams and Gracey interview each other, Gracey told his star, \u201cIn your own words you would refer to being dragged up on stage to perform like a monkey. I immediately thought of portraying you not as we see you, but as how you see yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith your voice and that monkey, I\u2019m going to see you and relate to you in a way that is going to be more engaging than yet another musical biopic,\u201d Gracey added.",
      "In an interview with the Associated Press, Williams said that he\u2019s identified with primates for a long time.",
      "\u201cMy MO has been cheeky,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a cheeky monkey all my life. There\u2019s no more cheekier monkey than the coke-snorting, sex-addict monkey that we find in the movie.\u201d",
      "Plus, Williams said, the gimmick was a way for the audience to better identify with him.",
      "\u201cWe care for animals more than we care for humans, most of us,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to USA Today, Williams also called the premise \"genius\" in the way that it hooks audiences.",
      "The decision \u201chas done what it was supposed to do, which is to get people talking and be contentious. I would say it\u2019s about eight to 12 minutes where the audience is going, \u2018What?\u2019 and then you completely forget and you\u2019re taken on a ride that you\u2019ve never seen,\u201d he said."

      "Hoda ended her letter by recalling her 60th birthday celebration. When she announced her TODAY exit in September, Hoda said that turning 60 was a pivotal moment in her life because that was when she knew it was time for her to \"try something new.\"",
      "\"When I turned 60, you threw me one hell of a party. I reached the mountaintop so high on that day, I knew in that very moment there was no greater peak,\" she said in her letter. \u201cAnd along the way, you invited me into your lives, your triumphs, your special moments and your celebrations. Having a front-row seat to all of this truly helped shape who I am. Thank you so much for letting me be part of your journey.",
      "\"I have become who I am on this hour of this show, and you are there with me every step of the way. So as I sit here today in my final moments, on this final day in this chapter of my career, I want to say thank you from the bottom of my very full heart for the ride of a lifetime. I love you.\"",

      "In the episode, called \"Volunteers,\" the \"It's Always Sunny\" crew arrives at Abbott to fulfill a community service requirement after a crime spree.",
      "Janine (Quinta Brunson) gets help from Dee (Kaitlin Olson) in the classroom, before Dee develops a crush on Janine's boyfriend, Gregory (Tyler James Williams), sparking an intense, one-sided rivalry.",
      "Elsewhere, Mac (Rob McElhenney) tries to butter up Ava (\"Let me know if there's anything you need, and I mean anything,\" he says) in order to get her signature and sign off on their volunteering time early. Janitor Mr. Johnson (William Stanford Davis) and newcomer Frank (Danny DeVito) fight over how best to repel raccoons in the school's garden and fittingly exchange insults over who is more \"trash\"-like.",
      "But the groups don't completely disagree. Charlie (Charlie Day) spends time with Jacob (Chris Perfetti), Melissa (Lisa Ann Walter) and Barbara (Sheryl Lee Ralph), and the teachers realize he struggles to read. After helping him sound out words in a picture book, Charlie is honored at a \"moving up\" ceremony to show his mastery of the kindergarten reading level.",
      "Dennis (Glenn Howerton) largely remains missing from the episode. After realizing that the Abbott teachers are being filmed (intrinsic to its mockumentary format), Dennis hides from the cameras.",
      "\"I know quite a bit about filming and consent, and I think I'll be spending my time on the other side of the camera, thank you very much,\" Dennis says.",
      "What has the cast said about the crossover?",
      "In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, McElhenney said he and Brunson were eager to do a two-part crossover.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s what we keyed in on very early. That would be the most fun because we get to play the same characters in the tone of 'Abbott,' and they get to play the same characters from 'Abbott' in the tone of 'Sunny.' That\u2019s what will allow us to satisfy the authenticity of each show but then also stretch and do something different,\" he said.",
      "What will happen in the second crossover episode?",
      "Part 2 of the crossover will air at a later date since production on Season 17 of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" recently finished, per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "When determining which episode would air first, McElhenney said it made the most sense to start with \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think just by nature of the schedule. In some ways, you look at the \u2018Abbott\u2019 episode, and it stands on its own, and it\u2019s so great, and it\u2019s a fully realized story,\" McElhenney said.",
      "But the \"It's Always Sunny\" episode will cast the episode \u2014 and its jokes \u2014 in a new light.",
      "\"Then when you see our episode, it feels like it\u2019s almost like a giant setup, and then this is the punchline,\" he said. \"But then you can watch them in either order, and they both make sense.\"",
      "The crossover episode of \"Abbott Elementary\" ended with the gang meeting their volunteer hours requirement and leaving the school, to the Abbott teachers' relief.",
      "The next crossover will be told through the \"prism of 'Sunny,'\" McElhenney said.",
      "Could the \"Abbott Elementary\" cast stop by Paddy's Pub? After all, Melissa has already been\u00a0\u2014 though she called it \u201cthe skeeviest bar\u201d she's ever been to."

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 15:32:54 GMT",
    "summary": "What is the meaning of Zendaya's engagement ring? Jewelers break down the meaning, style, setting carats and price of the diamond. Inside the east west diamond.",
    "story": [
      "When Zendaya walked the Golden Globes red carpet on Jan. 5, it wasn\u2019t her and long-time stylist Law Roach\u2019s ability to perfect a look that caught people\u2019s attention.",
      "It was the diamond rock perched on her left ring finger.",
      "Fans began speculating Zendaya was wearing an engagement ring, indicating she and Tom Holland had decided to take the next step in their relationship.",
      "TMZ and People reported the engagement on Jan. 6, citing sources close to the couple. TODAY.com has reached out to Zendaya and Holland for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Zendaya is keeping mum \u2014 but her ring tells a story, jewelry experts say.",
      "Laura Taylor, an engagement ring specialist at the U.K. based jewelry brand Lorel Diamonds, estimates the diamond in Zendaya\u2019s ring comes in at about five carats. The stone has a horizontal, or \u201ceast-west,\u201d orientation and is set a Georgian-style cut-down, also called a button-back setting. The ring is two-tone, featuring both gold and silver-hued metals.",
      "The effect, Taylor says, is the perfect example of \u201cOld Hollywood glamour with a modern twist.\u201d The cushion-cut diamond and the button-back setting give the ring vintage familiarity, whereas the east-west orientation and mixed metals make it feel edgy.",
      "Typically found in antiques, the button-back setting is unique because the jewel is fully encircled with metal and prongs (in this case, six), allowing it to sit lower on the band. Taylor calls the low setting a \u201cpractical\u201d choice with an heirloom feel.",
      "The east-west orientation, an alternative to the more typical vertical style, also gives the ring an edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle yet confident way to say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this our way,\u2019\u201d Taylor says.",
      "The east-west orientation also symbolizes \u201cequal partnership and commitment,\u201d Julia Briggs Parsons, founder and CEO of luxury jewelry brand Incredible Rising, says.",
      "Jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 believes the ring was designed by Jessica McCormack. TODAY.com has reached out to the jeweler for comment. \u201cShe\u2019s giving quiet luxury \u2014 Jessica McCormack is very, \u2018If you know, you know,\u2019\u201d Chaf\u00e9 says.",
      "Based on the brand and the size of the stone, Chaf\u00e9 estimates the ring cost over $200,000.",
      "Initially, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised the ring was not designed by Bulgari, as Zendaya is an ambassador for the luxury brand. In fact, Zendaya and Bulgari\u2019s long relationship was a clue into the engagement. At the Golden Globes, Bulgari took credit for all of Zendaya\u2019s jewelry \u2014 except the ring on her left hand.",
      "The seemingly deliberate choice by the couple makes the ring all the more personal. \u201cThis engagement ring looks like it\u2019s been handed down through generations of love stories,\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Uniquely theirs, jewelers also predict features in Zendaya's ring, like the button-back setting and east-west orientation, will rise in popularity, just like Selena Gomez's recent engagement ring may do for marquise cuts.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m very fortunate. The man that I am married to is Senator Vincent Hughes, seventh Senatorial district of Pennsylvania,\u201d she told the publication.",
      "She continued, \u201cYou fall in love with somebody and you realize he\u2019s not leaving his career. He\u2019s not leaving Philadelphia. I\u2019m not leaving Hollywood. When you have children, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d",

    "summary": "\"The Traitors\" host Alan Cumming says there are lots of \"extra twists\" in Season 3 of \"The Traitors.\" He also says the most stressful part of the process.",
    "story": [
      "You might think the 21 contestants who will battle to be the last \u201cFaithful\u201d or \u201cTraitor\u201d standing in the new season of Peacock\u2019s hit reality competition show, the Traitors have a slight advantage. After all, they have two previous seasons of the show to review to devise their strategy.",
      "But the show\u2019s Emmy-winning host, the deliciously larger-than-life Alan Cumming, tells TODAY.com that the show\u2019s producers are always one step ahead of the contestants.",
      "\u201cThey did all these twists. Extra twists. It was really twisty,\u201d Cumming says gleefully in the TODAY greenroom just after chatting with host Savannah Guthrie in Studio 1A. \u201cI actually thought, \u2018Are there too many twists?\u2019 But when I saw it, it\u2019s great.\u201d",
      "Cumming enjoys watching the contestants scheme and stumble through the game on television monitors in his dressing room \u2014 which he refers to as \u201ca James Bond baddies lair\u201d \u2014 while he makes his breakfast and hangs out with Lala, his canine co-host.",
      "\u201cI feel I\u2019m crazy with power, that I have all this information,\u201d he jokes.",
      "Each unexpected twist threw the contestants off their game and upped their anxiety, which affected their decision-making skills. \u201cBasically, there\u2019s mental breakdowns all around,\u201d says Cumming.",
      "The host, who always appears so self-possessed on screen, says that he had his own anxieties during filming one particular scene: the traitors selection at the first Round Table.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly stressful, and I feel I could sort of screw up the entire show in one fell swoop if I got it wrong,\u201d he shares.",
      "Cumming says that while the contestants sit around the table blindfolded, he circles the room \u201chundreds\u201d of times. He taps every contestant on the shoulder, both to capture the moment on camera and to demonstrate to contestants what it feels like to be selected as a traitor. Then Cumming continues to circle, making theatrical motions with his arms to add a bit of confusion to the process. He even goes around the table backward.",
      "At the same time, Cumming can hear discussion from the control room in his earpiece, increasing his own tension. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy when it\u2019s over,\u201d he says.",
      "Cumming knows that the round table was a success if he hears contestants dissecting his movements.",
      "\u201cI love it when they go, \u2018I heard the cloth of his jacket moving.\u2019 Then I go, \u2018Nailed it!\u2019\u201d he says jubilantly.",

OK,'\" Clarkson continued. \"And he let me know that day that that\u2019s what he wanted to go by for his stage name, I guess. I don\u2019t know. It was really cute. But, anyway, he was adorable. It was so much fun.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "CARACAS, Venezuela  \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn in Friday to serve a third six-year term, extending his increasingly repressive rule until 2031 despite protests and credible evidence that his opponent won the election.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by police, military and intelligence officers. Crowds of people, many sporting pro-Maduro T-shirts, gathered in adjacent streets and a nearby plaza.",
      "Maduro accused the opposition of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war,\u201d and said the faction\u2019s failure to stop the inauguration was \u201ca great Venezuelan victory.\u201d He accused external powers of \u201cattacking\u201d Venezuela, specifically the U.S. government, and promised to guarantee \u201cpeace and national sovereignty.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday more than ever I feel the weight of commitment, the power that I represent, the power that the constitution grants me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America.\u201d",
      "The opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines following the July 28 election, posted the tallies online and said they show Gonz\u00e1lez won twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election on the government\u2019s invitation, declared the opposition-published tallies legitimate. Other election experts that the government allowed to witness the vote said polling records posted online by the opposition appear to exhibit all of the original security features.",
      "On Friday, the European Union imposed sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials who had a role in the country\u2019s 2024 election, including the president and vice president of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, the electoral agency and others. The 27-nation bloc said those officials have put the nation\u2019s democracy at risk. The U.S. Treasury Department also slapped a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials, including the president of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, Maduro\u2019s transportation minister and state-owned airline, among others.",
      "On Thursday, as hundreds of anti-Maduro protesters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas, aides to opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she was briefly detained by security forces and coerced into recording videos.",
      "The popular former lawmaker, whom the government has barred from running for office, had emerged from months of hiding to join the rally to demand Gonz\u00e1lez be sworn in instead of Maduro.",
      "Machado addressed the rally then left on a motorcycle with her security convoy. Machado\u2019s press team later announced on social media that security forces \u201cviolently intercepted\u201d her convoy. Her aides confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner was detained.",
      "Leaders in the Americas and Europe condemned the government for suppressing opposition voices and demanded her release. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his support for Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "\u201cThese freedom fighters should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Maduro\u2019s supporters denied that Machado was arrested, saying government opponents were spreading fake news to generate an international crisis.",
      "The brouhaha ahead of Maduro\u2019s inauguration added to the litany of allegations of electoral fraud and brutal repression to silence dissent.",
      "Electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court \u2014 also filled with allies of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela \u2014 to audit the election results. The court reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory without providing thorough evidence and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But neither the council nor the ruling party produced any evidence that Maduro had won, even though their voting center representatives also were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine.",
      "The dispute over the results prompted international outrage and nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary. More than 20 people were killed during the unrest and many protesters reported being tortured in custody.",
      "Outside Friday\u2019s inauguration ceremony, Maduro\u2019s supporters were overjoyed. One of them was Maricarmen Ruiz, 18, who couldn\u2019t hold back her tears.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have words to express my emotion, I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said, expressing relief that opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez wasn\u2019t \u201cimposed\u201d instead as president.",
      "It is unclear how many heads of state attended Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, hosted by the ruling party-controlled National Assembly. Cameras showed Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega and Cuba\u2019s Miguel Diaz-Canel, and Maduro greeted delegates from what he said numbered more than 120 nations.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a close Maduro ally, said he would skip the event citing the detentions earlier in the week of another longtime Venezuelan opposition member and a human rights defender.",
      "Maduro\u2019s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba\u2019s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales. The 2018 election was widely considered a sham after his government banned major opposition parties from participating.",
      "And it remains unclear if Gonz\u00e1lez, who left for exile in Spain in September, will fulfill his promise to return to Venezuela by Friday.",
      "Government officials have repeatedly threatened Gonz\u00e1lez with arrest should he step on Venezuelan soil. On Tuesday, Gonz\u00e1lez said his son-in-law Rafael Tudares had been kidnapped in Caracas. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s daughter, Mariana Gonz\u00e1lez de Tudares, suggested in a statement that the government was behind her husband\u2019s disappearance.",
      "\u201cAt what point did being related to Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia become a crime?\u201d she said."

      "It has long been a source of shame as much as curiosity.",

      "In the country where teenage diarist Anne Frank is the most famous victim of the Holocaust, a research project funded by the Dutch government has for the first time published a list of nearly half a million people suspected of collaboration during World War II, after a law prohibiting its release expired on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "The \u201cWar in Court\u201d project, which\u00a0received an $18.5 million (18 million euros) grant from the three Dutch ministries that govern education, health and justice, has made public a digital archive that includes a list of 425,000 mostly Dutch people who were investigated for collaborating with the Netherlands\u2019 Nazi occupiers.",

      "\u201cAt the very least, it shows that huge numbers of people were accused of collaborating with the Nazi occupier,\u201d Stone told NBC News by email. \u201cAnd the fact that relatively few were imprisoned probably tells us as much about postwar Dutch society as it does about the wartime facts.\u201d",

      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an exclusive interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which are uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe gangs didn\u2019t take over in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was gradual. They worked on your mind first. They started kidnapping people in 2021, and I had to keep leaving my house to stay with my family. Eventually, it wasn\u2019t safe for me or my mom anymore.\u201d",
      "The mother and daughter spent two years shuttling between their home and staying with family members outside of Port-au-Prince. As the violence escalated, they fled Haiti. After a tumultuous escape, Dolcine and her mother came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s Humanitarian Parole Program, which currently creates a legal pathway for temporary visas for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Eligible individuals are granted permission to stay in the country for up to two years, allowing them also work. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including passing security screenings, and are required to have a U.S.-based sponsor. The program, known as the CHNV, aims to address the growing refugee crises in countries like Haiti.",

      "Sponsored by her great-aunt, Dolcine and her mother entered the U.S. legally in December 2023. She now works full time as an assistant at her church in New York City, while caring for her mother, who is disabled.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump announced plans to launch an unprecedented deportation initiative targeting undocumented criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers. During a NewsNation interview, Trump also mentioned his intention to end programs like Temporary Protected Status, which is set to expire in 2026 and would need to be renewed.\u00a0The program has been adopted by administrations going back to George H.W. Bush.",
      "However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emphasizes that potential beneficiaries of the program undergo rigorous background checks to ensure they pose no security threat to the U.S. Trump\u2019s team did not specifically address the impact of these plans on Haitian migrants when reached by NBC News.",

      "Orilas Jean Francois was also forced to leave Haiti, under extenuating circumstances, he said. Back home he owned construction and finance businesses, which provided a stable life for his family, he said. But in early 2024, Francois started to conceive an escape plan from the violence and economic collapse that define the island nation today.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to leave to find safety and a way to provide for my wife and children.\u201d",
      "Port-au-Prince is facing a surge in violence, with at least 5,600 killings and nearly 1,500 kidnappings reported last year, according to the United Nations. A December massacre in Cit\u00e9 Soleil claimed at least 207 lives, with victims mutilated, burned or dumped at sea by the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie gang.",
      "Political unrest and gang violence delayed his departure from Haiti multiple times, even after he was authorized to enter the U.S. under the Humanitarian Parole Program.",
      "\u201cIn March, I had my ticket and my documents ready to travel, but a massive prison break left the streets unsafe and flights were canceled,\u201d Francois said. His trip was delayed so many times that his initial authorization expired, forcing him to petition USCIS for an extension. \u201cThe stress was unbearable.\u201d",
      "Francois finally arrived in the U.S. in July under the program.After living with his family in New York City for a few months, Francois said he is focused on learning English and finding steady work.",

      "Francois and Dolcine both emphasized their commitment to self-sufficiency, pushing back on rhetoric about migrants relying on government aid.",
      "The temporary programs, however, come with issues. Last year, the Humanitarian Parole Program was briefly paused after at least 101,000 applications were filed by so-called serial sponsors, repeatedly using the same contact information and Social Security numbers, according to USCIS.",
      "Nonetheless, Dolcine highlighted the contributions of Haitian migrants in the United States, who are predominantly employed in service-related occupations, with a significant presence in health care support roles. According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 71% of Haitian immigrants aged 16 and older participate in the civilian labor force, compared to 66% of the overall foreign-born population.",

      "In the final weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House, the focus of his public remarks has not been about the confirmations of his Cabinet picks or on key parts of his campaign agenda like mass deportations or lowering prices.",
      "Instead, Trump \u2014 who has criticized U.S. military involvement in other countries \u2014 is advocating for America to gain more global territory, including by force, if necessary. Call it his annexation agenda.",
      "In recent days, Trump has repeatedly pushed the idea that he will take over Greenland from Denmark, reclaim the Panama Canal after the United States returned it to the Panamanian government decades ago and absorb Canada into the United States. Trump said he is keeping the option of using the military to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal on the table while saying he will exert \u201ceconomic force\u201d to pressure Canada to join the United States. He has also said he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, North America\u2019s tallest peak.",
      "Panamanian, Danish and Canadian leaders have all shot down Trump\u2019s wishes, with responses ranging from no to not \u201ca snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s willingness to provoke longtime U.S. allies and throw out unexpected demands gives a glimpse of the domestic, and global, shakeup he hopes to accomplish. Democrats and Republicans who spoke to NBC News, including close Trump allies, said some of his recent demands are serious and some are ways to gain leverage for other parts of his agenda, while others are just trolling.",
      "Greenland is an island Trump very much desires. A person familiar with the discussions said Trump has never given up on acquiring Greenland, which he tried to purchase during his first term for defense reasons and was rebuffed.",
      "This person added that Trump also enjoys the way the effort gets people spun up. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took a trip to Nuuk, the largest population center on the island of about 57,000 people, and the president-elect called in to deliver a message to Greenlanders.",
      "Acquiring the Panama Canal falls into the category of something Trump may want but is also using as an economic pressure campaign.",
      "For years, he has felt that President Jimmy Carter should not have returned the Panama Canal to Panama. But John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser who has since broken with him, told NBC News in an interview that while he served under Trump he didn\u2019t hear any talk of acquiring the Panama Canal (or making Canada the 51st state). The person familiar also said reclaiming the canal was not a focus during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "But it is now on the table because of another part of Trump\u2019s agenda: combating the influence of China.",
      "According to this person and a second person familiar with the discussions, Trump allies have shown the president-elect data they argue shows Chinese encroachment in the Western Hemisphere, including the accusation that Panama has the ability to prioritize Chinese over American shipping. The second person familiar with the discussions said Trump\u2019s threat to take the canal is \u201ca negotiating tool\u201d to get Panama to get more favorable treatment for U.S. shipments.",
      "On Canada, Trump\u2019s remarks amount to \u201can epic troll,\u201d the first person said, adding that he is not serious about absorbing the country into the United States. Yet, this person said, Trump believes his trolling could get some policies to cut his way and help with negotiations. Last month, Canadian officials announced a plan to increase spending on border security, which was a focus of the Republican presidential primary campaign last year.",

Feeley, who was the U.S. ambassador to Panama under President Barack Obama and Trump before he resigned over policy disagreements with Trump, said Trump\u2019s public push will put incoming ambassadors behind the eight ball.",
      "\u201cIf Trump attempts to operationalize the threats made to Panama, Canada and Greenland \u2026 it\u2019s going to put any ambassador in the most difficult position I can conceive of: telling a treaty ally your boss plans to take their sovereign homeland,\u201d Feeley said.",
      "Countering China's influence",
      "Trump and his allies have pointed to national security as the rationale for why the U.S. should acquire Greenland, with Trump posting on his Truth Social platform last month that American \u201cownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\u201d The island, which has been under Denmark\u2019s control since the 14th century, was fully integrated into Denmark in 1953 under the country\u2019s constitution, and it became a self-governing territory in 1979. Greenlanders have full citizenship in Denmark.",
      "Greenland is closer to New York than Copenhagen, and the United States briefly occupied it during World War II. It is home to a large U.S. Air Force base and major mineral reserves. In recent years, China has sought to make inroads on the island.",
      "Carla Sands, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Denmark, said the Danes simply do not have the capacity to properly defend the island, while China\u2019s attempts to boost ties with Greenland have had American officials on high alert.",
      "\u201cWe are great partners and allies with Denmark,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had diplomatic relations with them for 200 years. They\u2019re founding members of NATO. So we\u2019re good friends, but good friends sometimes have to have tough conversations. And one of the conversations was, \u2018How are you going to defend Greenland, part of your kingdom, when you can\u2019t even defend Denmark proper?\u2019\"",
      "\u201cThe only capabilities that Denmark controls for Greenland are defense and foreign policy; everything else Greenland controls,\u201d Sands added. \u201cAnd that makes Greenland really, really vulnerable to bad actors, because they want economic growth.\u201d",
      "But Rufus Gifford, the ambassador to Denmark in the Obama administration and finance chair of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, said gaining Greenland would not be anywhere near as simple as Trump may make it seem.For starters, Gifford said, \u201cany Danish prime minister that loses Greenland in this day and age would be the laughingstock of the country, and would be forever.\u201d And, he added, Greenlanders may not want to give up their \u201cfairly privileged place in Danish society.\u201d",
      "As far as national security concerns go, Gifford said any military incursion into Greenland would invoke NATO\u2019s Article Five, which requires the alliance\u2019s members to defend it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly concern about Chinese influence in Greenland, and there should be,\u201d he said, adding, though, \u201cthe only reason why you would say that, for national security reasons, Greenland needs to be American would be if you\u2019re threatening to pull out of NATO. And that part is all the scarier.\u201d",
      "When it comes to the Panama Canal, Trump has framed his own focus on U.S. ships being \u201covercharged\u201d to use the waterway, as he said Tuesday, while he believes Chinese ships are getting preferential treatment. Trump also said he long believed Carter was mistaken to have negotiated treaties that turned over control of the canal to Panama.",
      "A Hong Kong-based company operates two of the five ports that serve the canal. China, via its 2020 national security law, has extended its influence over Hong Kong.",
      "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who said in December that \u201cevery square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to be so,\u201d denied last month that China has influence over the waterway, which the Panama Canal Authority administers.",
      "\u201cIn the president\u2019s universe of alternate facts, he can huff and puff and maybe Panama will return him the canal,\u201d Feeley said. \u201cIn the real world, however, Panama is not about to return the canal. What he has done, in practical political terms, is solidify tremendous support among the 4.3 million Panamanians around Mulino, a relatively new president.\u201d",
      "'A full-on takedown'",
      "Trump has mocked the Canadian government for weeks after he met with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, to discuss the potential for tariffs of 25% on Canadian goods imported into the United States. He has called Trudeau, who announced his resignation this week, \u201cGov. Trudeau\u201d and suggested Canadians would love to be the 51st state. He has even called for hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, a famous Canadian who has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago, to run for prime minister.",
      "At his news conference Tuesday, Trump said he would use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to merge Canada with the United States, describing the northern border as an \u201cartificially drawn line.\u201d He lamented the United States\u2019 \u201cspending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada,\u201d a NATO ally that also shares a military alliance with the United States through North American Aerospace Defense Command.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s comments, Trudeau said on X: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\u201d",
      "Bolton said the poking at Canada \u201cprobably comes from sitting around the dinner table at Mar-a-Lago and thinking of things to do to make Justin Trudeau unhappy.\u201d\u201cThis is trolling,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cHe knows it offends Trudeau to call him \u2018Gov. Trudeau\u2019 and talk about Canada as the 51st state. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much thought beyond that.\u201d",
      "Bolton said it would be wrong to look at Trump\u2019s interest in acquiring foreign territory and conclude he is rolling out a new strategic vision for the United States.",
      "\u201cThere is no philosophy\u201d behind Trump\u2019s statements,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThere is no strategy. This is this week\u2019s series of neuron flashes.\u201d",
      "Coupled with calls from Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and Trump\u2019s sidekick, to replace leadership in the United Kingdom and Germany, Trump is putting immense pressure on some of America\u2019s closest allies before he even takes office. Trudeau\u2019s resignation was, in part, connected to Trump\u2019s pressure campaign and calls to implement sweeping tariffs.",
      "\u201cYou could make the argument that he took down Justin Trudeau just now,\u201d Gifford said, adding: \u201cMusk is trying to do the same in both the U.K. and Germany right now. So this isn\u2019t just like diplomatic pressure. This is like a full-on takedown of some of our best allies.\u201d",
      "Conservative media has boosted Trump\u2019s annexation effort in recent days. On Fox News, prime-time host Sean Hannity has promoted it as a wise endeavor. Then, the New York Post, one of Trump\u2019s favorite publications, highlighted the \u201cDonroe Doctrine\u201d on its Wednesday cover, a play on President James Monroe\u2019s 19th century outline of the U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Congressional Republicans are already pushing legislation to advance the agenda. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., plans to introduce a bill Thursday that would allow Trump to \u201center into negotiations for the reacquisition of the Panama Canal.\u201d And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced moments after Trump called to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America\u201d on Tuesday that she would introduce legislation in the House to do so.",
      "The first person familiar with the discussions told NBC News that Trump first expressed interest in changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico last month and that the president-elect was fixated on the idea, though people close to him do not believe he can do much it. But this person said Trump\u2019s push to rename Denali back to Mount McKinley is serious, and unlike changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, changing the name is fully within the power of the U.S. government. Obama changed the name from Mount McKinley to Denali, its earlier name, in 2015.",
      "Democrats have offered a mixed response to the agenda. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday on X that he \u201cwould welcome\u201d Greenland as the 53rd state \u201cright after we admit Puerto Rico and Washington DC.\u201d And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that he would \u201cagree to working with Donald Trump on renaming the Gulf of Mexico, only if he first agrees to work with us on an actual plan to lower costs for Americans.\u201d",

      "The outcome reflected shifts in the power balance in Lebanon and the\u00a0wider Middle East, with Shi\u2019ite Muslim Hezbollah badly pummeled from last year\u2019s war, and its Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad toppled in December.",
      "It also indicated a revival of Saudi influence in a country where Riyadh\u2019s role was eclipsed by Iran and Hezbollah long ago.",
      "U.S. ambassador to\u00a0Lebanon\u00a0Lisa Johnson said she was \u201cvery happy\u201d over Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun\u2019s election as president on Thursday, ending a more than two-year vacuum in the post.",
      "Johnson and other foreign envoys had attended Thursday\u2019s session at the Lebanese parliament in which Aoun was elected.",
      "The election of a new Lebanese president turns a new page for the country and must now be followed by the appointment of a new government capable of carrying out reforms, France\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.",
      "Foreign ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said that a new government will have carry out reforms necessary for\u00a0Lebanon\u2019s economic recovery, stability, security and sovereignty, and added that France calls on all Lebanese political leaders and authorities to work towards those goals.",
      "The presidency, reserved for a Maronite Christian in Lebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system, has been vacant since Michel Aoun\u2019s term ended in October 2022, with deeply divided factions unable to agree on a candidate able to win enough votes in the 128-seat parliament.",
      "Aoun fell short of the 86 votes needed in a first round vote, but crossed the threshold with 99 votes in a second round, according to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, after lawmakers from Hezbollah and its Shi\u2019ite ally the Amal Movement backed him.",
      "Momentum built behind Aoun on Wednesday as Hezbollah\u2019s long preferred candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, withdrew and declared support for the army commander, and as French and Saudi envoys shuttled around Beirut, urging his election in meetings with politicians, three Lebanese political sources said.",
      "\u201cThere is a very clear message from the international community that they are ready to support Lebanon, but that needs a president, a government,\u201d Michel Mouawad, a Christian lawmaker opposed to Hezbollah who voted for Aoun, told Reuters before the vote. \u201cWe did get a message from Saudi of support,\u201d he added.",

      "Aoun has a key role in shoring up a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0between Hezbollah and Israel which was brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces.",

      "Pope\u00a0Francis on Thursday stepped up his\u00a0recent criticism\u00a0of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave \u201cvery serious and shameful\u201d.",
      "In a yearly address to diplomats delivered on his behalf by an aide, Francis appeared to reference\u00a0deaths\u00a0caused by winter cold in Gaza, where there is\u00a0almost no electricity.",
      "\u201cWe cannot in any way accept the bombing of civilians,\u201d the text said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot accept that children are freezing to death because hospitals have been destroyed or a country\u2019s energy network has been hit.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0pope, 88,\u00a0who\u00a0was present for the address but asked an aide to read it as he is\u00a0recovering from a cold,\u00a0also condemned anti-Semitism; called for an end to the war in Ukraine and other conflicts around the world; and expressed concern over climate change.",
      "The comments were part of an address to Vatican-accredited envoys from some 184 countries that is sometimes called the\u00a0pope\u2019s\u00a0\u201cstate of the world\u201c\u00a0speech. The Israeli ambassador to the Holy See was among those present for the event.",
      "Francis, leader of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts.",
      "But he has recently been\u00a0more outspoken\u00a0about Israel\u2019s military campaign against Palestinian militant group Hamas, and has\u00a0suggested\u00a0the global community should study whether the offensive constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people.",
      "An Israeli government minister\u00a0publicly denounced\u00a0the pontiff in December for that suggestion.",
      "The\u00a0pope\u2019s text said he condemns antisemitism, and called the growth of anti-Semitic groups \u201ca source of deep concern\u201d.",
      "Francis also called for an\u00a0end to the war\u00a0between Ukraine and Russia, which has killed tens of thousands.",
      "\u201cMy wish for the year 2025 is that the entire international community will work above all to end the conflict that, for almost three years now, has caused so much bloodshed,\u201d he said.",
      "The\u00a0pope\u00a0also addressed conflicts in places including Sudan, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Nicaragua and reiterated his frequent calls for action to confront the impacts of global climate change, and the spread of misinformation on social media."

      "A treacherous journey that has often spelled death for asylum-seekers crossing the Atlantic Ocean ended with the miracle of life this week after a baby girl was born on a migrant boat headed toward Spain's Canary Islands.",

      "\"Christmas ends in the Canary Islands with the rescue of a baby born in the middle of a voyage on the sea,\" Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo, the Spanish government's maritime rescue agency, said Wednesday on X.",
      "The agency said rescue crews were able to safely rescue those on the dinghy, with the mother and her newborn child airlifted to the eastern Lanzarote city of Arrecife. Local media reported that they were taken to a hospital nearby.",
      "Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the mother and child's condition Thursday. Reuters reported that the child is a girl, citing regional government and medical authorities.",

      "Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo said it was not the first such rescue for Trujillo, the ship's captain. In 2020, it said, he responded to a similar incident in which a woman had also just given birth on a dinghy crossing the Atlantic.",

    "story": [
      "Lebanon\u2019s parliament was set Thursday to make yet another effort to elect a president, filling a\u00a0vacuum\u00a0that\u2019s lasted for more than two years.",
      "While 12 previous attempts have failed to choose a successor to former President Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022, there are indications that Thursday\u2019s vote may produce a head of state.",
      "The leading candidate is Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun, no relation to the former president. He is widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild after a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.",
      "Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
      "However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, apparently clearing the way for the army chief.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected.",
      "As a sitting army commander, Joseph Aoun is technically barred from becoming president by Lebanon\u2019s constitution. The ban has been waived before, but it means Aoun faces additional procedural hurdles.",
      "Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round.",
      "But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun would need a two-thirds majority even in the second round.",
      "Other contenders include Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund, and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon\u2019s General Security agency.",
      "A president is needed to appoint a permanent prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president.",
      "The next government will face\u00a0daunting challenges\u00a0apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for\u00a0reconstruction.",
      "Lebanon is six years into an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country\u2019s currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal."
