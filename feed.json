      "The U.S. State Department's revelation that it has revoked visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is the latest indication that the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make public points",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the United States revokes someone's visa, it is typically confidential, with few exceptions. But with British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan and others, the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make a public point when it deems a case particularly egregious.",
      "The State Department\u2019s number two diplomat made headlines when he posted a social media message this week saying visas for the band for an upcoming U.S. tour had been revoked. British police are investigating whether a crime was committed when the duo's frontman led the audience in chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces \u2014 at a music festival in the U.K.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that their visas had been revoked \u201cin light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\u201d",
      "The band rejected claims of antisemitism and said in a statement that it was being \u201ctargeted for speaking up\u201d about the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and certain statutes related to the privacy of government documents, the State Department has for years resisted or refused to discuss specific cases in which visas may have been denied or revoked. Certain exemptions apply, such as when foreign officials and their immediate family members are found to ineligible for entry into the United States for violating anti-corruption or human rights regulations.",
      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",
      "\u201cForeigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said when asked about the public announcement.",
      "She said one reason for announcing the revocations was to make clear that the administration is serious about the standards it will apply to visa holders and applicants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about that standard, and this was a very public event that violated that very basic standard about the nature of who we want to let into the country,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Other recent cases have been less clear-cut, although some have ended up in public court cases.",
      "Earlier this year, as part of an initiative to expel foreign students who are accused by the Trump administration of engaging in pro-Hamas, anti-Israel or antisemitic activity, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had rescinded at least 300 visas and expected that number to rise.",
      "Many of those cases were not publicized individually.",
      "One that was: Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained by immigration authorities in Massachusetts for authoring an opinion piece criticizing Tufts University for not taking a tougher line on alleged Israeli atrocities in Gaza.",
      "U.S. officials said at the time that her visa had been revoked because of adverse foreign policy consequences if she remained in the United States.",
      "Other high-profile and public cases of visa revocations for political reasons date back decades, including actor Charlie Chaplin in 1952 during the Truman administration and an ultimately unsuccessful deportation attempt against Beatles singer John Lennon in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe practice of ideological exclusion has a long history in the United States, having been used for decades as a political tool to keep U.S. audiences from being exposed to dissident viewpoints,\u201d the human rights group Amnesty International said in a 2020 report.",
      "\u201cDuring the Cold War, in particular, the U.S. government denied visas to some of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, writers and artists who, the government thought, might promote Communism or other 'subversive' views,\u201d it said.",

      "While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his high-stakes federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel",
      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "Monday was the last day as an independent agency for the six-decade-old humanitarian and development organization, created by President John F. Kennedy as a peaceful way of promoting U.S. national security by boosting goodwill and prosperity abroad.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered USAID absorbed into the State Department on Tuesday.",
      "The former presidents and Bono spoke with thousands in the USAID community in a videoconference, which was billed as a closed-press event to allow political leaders and others privacy for sometimes angry and often teary remarks. Parts of the video were shared with The Associated Press.",
      "They expressed their appreciation for the thousands of USAID staffers who have lost their jobs and life's work. Their agency was one of the first and most fiercely targeted for government-cutting by President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, with staffers abruptly locked out of systems and offices and terminated by mass emailing.",
      "Trump claimed the agency was run by \u201cradical left lunatics\u201d and rife with \u201ctremendous fraud.\u201d Musk called it \u201ca criminal organization.\u201d",
      "Obama, speaking in a recorded statement, offered assurances to the aid and development workers, some listening from overseas.",
      "\"Your work has mattered and will matter for generations to come,\u201d he told them.",
      "Obama has largely kept a low public profile during Trump\u2019s second term and refrained from criticizing the monumental changes that Trump has made to U.S. programs and priorities at home and abroad.",
      "\u201cGutting USAID is a travesty, and it\u2019s a tragedy. Because it\u2019s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world,\u201d Obama said. He credited USAID with not only saving lives, but being a main factor in global economic growth that has turned some aid-receiving countries into U.S. markets and trade partners.",
      "The former Democratic president predicted that \u201dsooner or later, leaders on both sides of the aisle will realize how much you are needed.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the State Department said it would be introducing the department\u2019s foreign assistance successor to USAID, to be called America First, this week.",
      "\u201cThe new process will ensure there is proper oversight and that every tax dollar spent will help advance our national interests,\u201d the department said.",
      "USAID oversaw programs around the world, providing water and life-saving food to millions uprooted by conflict in Sudan, Syria, Gaza and elsewhere, sponsoring the \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d that revolutionized modern agriculture and curbed starvation and famine, preventing disease outbreaks, promoting democracy, and providing financing and development that allowed countries and people to climb out of poverty.",
      "Bush, who also spoke in a recorded message, went straight to the cuts in a landmark AIDS and HIV program started by his Republican administration and credited with saving 25 million lives around the world.",
      "Bipartisan blowback from Congress to cutting the popular President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, helped save significant funding for the program. But cuts and rule changes have reduced the number getting the life-saving care.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve showed the great strength of America through your work \u2014 and that is your good heart,\u2019\u2019 Bush told USAID staffers. \u201cIs it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you,\" he said.",
      "Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, former Colombian President Juan Manual Santos and former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield also spoke to the staffers.",
      "So did humanitarian workers, including one who spoke of the welcome appearance of USAID staffers with food when she was a frightened 8-year-old child in a camp for Liberian refugees. A World Food Program official vowed through sobs that the U.S. aid mission would be back someday.",
      "Bono, a longtime humanitarian advocate in Africa and elsewhere, was announced as the \u201csurprise guest,\u201d in shades and a cap.",
      "He jokingly hailed the USAID staffers as \u201csecret agents of international development\u201d in acknowledgment of the down-low nature of Monday\u2019s unofficial gathering of the USAID community.",
      "Bono spoke passionately as he recited a poem he had written to the agency and its gutting. He spoke of children dying of malnutrition, in a reference to people \u2014 millions, experts have said \u2014 who will die because of the U.S cuts to funding for health and other programs abroad.",
      "\u201cThey called you crooks. When you were the best of us,\u201d Bono said.",

      "Oliver devoted a May 4 segment to names and promotions of minor league baseball teams, announcing: \u201cWe are willing to use all of our resources and stupidity to give one Minor League Baseball team a total rebrand.

      "Oliver announced Sunday he had chosen Moon Mammoths, using Bob Costas' voice as narrator of a promotional video introducing the moniker.",
      "The name was inspired by the 1991 discovery of woolly mammoth remains by George Moon, a Summit Township resident who found a bone while scuba diving in Lake Pleasant, about 8 miles south of Erie. The mammoth remains are housed in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Erie, which has won the past two Eastern League championships, will be renamed the Moon Mammoths for games on July 19, Aug. 19, Sept. 12 and Sept. 13.",
      "Major League Baseball said Monday the team will wear jerseys with a rising moon with the team\u2019s name across the chest, a moon on sleeves and a patch with a woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "Oliver is expected to attend the July 19 game against Chesapeake, called a \u201cMammoth Fun\u201d night. The first 1,000 ticketed fans will receive a Moon Mammoths squishy toy and there will be postgame fireworks. George Moon was also invited to attend.",

      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",
      "The center, which previously featured daily programs such as taekwondo and ballet, may not be operational in a few months if the funding landscape remains as is.",
      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",
      "A spokesman for the administration said Prasad \u201chas raised serious concerns\u201d about the issue.",
      "\u201cWe will not ignore these risks and will ensure that the gold standard of science is used for any decisions,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, in an emailed statement.",
      "Outside researchers have noted that cases of the heart condition tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",

      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",

      "\u201cThe level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,\" said District Attorney Melinda Katz. \u201cI thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court has thrown out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices\u2019 recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.",
      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",
      "The justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.",
      "The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.",
      "In one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care.",

      "A Ukrainian woman, Olha Kurtmalaieva, has endured cancer and war while fighting to bring her husband home from Russian captivity",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "A court in Estonia says Russia's military intelligence service ordered an arson attack on a restaurant and supermarket there last year",
      "An arson attack on a restaurant and supermarket in Estonia last year were ordered by Russian intelligence, an Estonian court said Wednesday.",
      "The attack was one in a series across Europe tracked by The Associated Press and linked to Russia by Western officials. The goal, they asserted, is to sow division in Western societies and undermine support for Ukraine.",
      "The Harju County Court in Estonia said the perpetrators were two Moldovan men who are cousins, both named Ivan Chihaial. One was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for the arson attack on the restaurant and supermarket, which the court said was carried out on behalf of Russia's security services.",
      "The other Ivan Chihaial was an accomplice and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison.",
      "In a statement, the court said the first Chihaial was tasked with the operation by Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU.",
      "It said he carried out a trial operation on behalf of the GRU in January 2024, setting fire to a Co-op supermarket in the village of Osula in southeastern Estonia. The next day someone acting on behalf of the GRU tasked him with setting fire to the Slava Ukraina restaurant in the capital, Tallinn.",
      "Chihaial drove with his cousin to the restaurant on the night of Jan. 31, 2024, then they set fire to it and left Estonia. The court said Chihaial's cousin was unaware he was working for the GRU.",
      "The court said the defendants set fire to the supermarket and the restaurant by breaking a window, pouring in gasoline, placing a bag with a gasoline can inside and igniting it.",
      "Authorities in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland worked to detain the men who were apprehended in Italy before being sent to Estonia to face trial, said State Prosecutor Triinu Olev-Aas.",
      "The arson is the latest attack on Estonia since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In prior cases, Estonia suffered cyberattacks and the windows of cars belonging to a politician and journalist were smashed.",
      "Previous attackers have been recruited inside Russia, which shares a border with Estonia. The Estonian Internal Security Service said the fact that Russia's intelligence agencies used Moldovans who were sent to the country showed they are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit, including among dual citizens.",
      "Russia has been accused of a widespread sabotage campaign by Western officials since its invasion of Ukraine. As well as cases of arson, the attacks across Europe range from stuffing car tailpipes with expanding foam in Germany to a plot to plant explosives on cargo planes, hacking that targeted politicians and critical infrastructure and spying by a ring convicted in the U.K.",
      "President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has told the AP that the Kremlin has never been shown \u201cany proofs\u201d supporting accusations of a broader sabotage campaign and said \u201ccertainly we definitely reject any allegations.\u201d",

      "Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has pardoned 16 more prisoners, continuing his selective releases while also cracking down on dissent",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko announced pardons for 16 more prisoners on Wednesday, a gesture that comes as the unrelenting crackdown on dissent continues.",
      "The newly pardoned prisoners were convicted on a variety of criminal charges, including extremism \u2014 a charge often used against dissidents and government critics in Belarus. Human rights advocates welcomed the release of the prisoners, but stressed that it is taking place as more people are being arrested in politically driven cases.",
      "Last month, the Belarusian government pardoned and released 14 prisoners, but at least 60 more people were arrested on politically motivated charges, said Pavel Sapelka, a rights advocate with the Viasna human rights center, the country's oldest and most prominent rights group. Sapelka, in conversation with The Associated Press, compared the situation in Belarus to \u201crevolving doors, where new political prisoners take the place of those released.\"",
      "Mass arrests and convictions of government critics in Belarus have continued since 2020, when Lukashenko was handed a sixth term in office in an election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.",
      "Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in the biggest demonstrations that the country had ever seen. Authorities unleashed a violent crackdown, detaining and beating thousands and driving many more into exile abroad. The suppression of dissent drew international condemnation, and the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus.",
      "As of Wednesday, Viasna has designated 1,164 people behind bars as political prisoners. The number includes 38 journalists and the group\u2019s founder, Ales Bialiatski, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. At least eight political prisoners have died behind bars.",
      "Lukashenko, who in January secured another term in office in another election the opposition denounced as a sham, has recently been pardoning some political prisoners, seeking to improve ties with the West. In total, he has pardoned and freed more than 300 prisoners since July 2024, including some U.S. citizens and other foreigners.",
      "Last month, Belarusian authorities released prominent opposition figure Siarhei Tsikhanouski and 13 others and brought them to Lithuania. Their release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.",
      "Commenting on the high-profile release on Tuesday evening, Lukashenko said \u201cGod forbid\u201d those freed last month died behind bars. \u201cWe would have been blamed for doing it to them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it's politics.\u201d",
      "Sapelka told AP on Wednesday that there likely aren't any prominent dissidents among the 16 newly released prisoners.",

      "These are among the factors that have led to the escalating tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan, the oil-rich Caspian Sea country where President Ilhan Aliyev has been in power since 2003 -- almost as long as the 25-year rule of Vladimir Putin in Russia.",
      "Here is a look at the previously warm relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan and what has happened:",
      "Russia and Azerbaijan developed strong economic and cultural ties after 1993 when Aliyev\u2019s father, Heydar, who also was Azerbaijan\u2019s Soviet-era Communist boss, became president. Like Putin, the younger Aliyev has suppressed political foes and restricted independent media.",
      "Azerbaijan has bought oil and natural gas from Russia to meet internal demand while exporting its own energy riches to the West. Russia also has been the main market for Azerbaijan\u2019s fruit and vegetable exports. It also is a key transport corridor for Russia\u2019s trade with Iran and other partners in the Middle East.",
      "Azerbaijani businessmen control significant assets in construction, real estate, trade and other sectors of the Russian economy.",
      "Russia is home to a sizable Azerbaijani diaspora. A 2021 census listed about a half-million ethnic Azerbaijanis living in Russia, but unofficial estimates put that number as high as 2 million.",
      "Relations with Baku have become increasingly important for the Kremlin since it sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, especially as Turkey has become a key economic partner for Russia as it faced sweeping Western sanctions.",
      "Just before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, an open confrontation erupted between two of its former republics in the South Caucasus \u2014 Azerbaijan and its neighbor, Armenia. After years of fighting, Armenian-backed separatists won control of Azerbaijan\u2019s region of Karabakh and nearby territories.",
      "Russia claimed neutrality in the conflict even though it provided economic assistance and supplied weapons to Armenia that hosted its military base. Moscow cosponsored peace talks under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, but they didn't produce a deal.",
      "In 2020, Azerbaijan's military, bolstered by weapons supplied by ally Turkey, recaptured broad swaths of territory that were held for nearly three decades by Armenian forces. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.",
      "Azerbaijan reclaimed full control of Karabakh in September 2023 after a lightning military campaign. Russia, busy with its war in Ukraine, didn\u2019t intervene, angering Armenia's leadership that responded by scaling down its ties with Moscow and bolstering relations with the West.",
      "The victory in Karabakh has fueled Azerbaijan\u2019s ambitions and prompted Aliyev to take a more assertive stand in relations with his neighbors.",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet crashed while on a flight from Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya. Azerbaijani authorities said the jet was accidentally hit by fire from Russian air defenses, then tried to land in western Kazakhstan when it crashed, killing 38 of 67 people aboard.",
      "Putin apologized to Aliyev for what he called a \u201ctragic incident\u201d but stopped short of acknowledging responsibility. Aliyev, meanwhile, criticized Moscow for trying to \u201chush up\u201d the incident.",
      "In May, Aliyev declined to attend Russia\u2019s Victory Day parade in Moscow alongside other leaders of ex-Soviet nations. Later that month, a Ukrainian foreign minister visited Baku, a sign of closer ties with Kyiv.",
      "On June 27, police raided the homes of several ethnic Azerbaijanis in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, in what authorities said was part of an investigation into murders dating back decades. Brothers Huseyn and Ziyaddin Safarov died and several other ethnic Azerbaijanis were seriously injured.",
      "The bodies were sent to Azerbaijan, where authorities attributed the deaths to \u201cpost-traumatic shock caused by multiple injuries.\u201d The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office said the brothers were subjected to beatings and other physical abuse by Russian police.",
      "Azerbaijan responded by calling off previously scheduled Russian official visits and cultural events.",
      "On Monday, masked police stormed the Baku offices of Sputnik Azerbaijan, a Kremlin-funded media outlet, and arrested seven of its employees. Police also rounded up eight other Russian IT experts and other professionals, who were accused of drug trafficking and cybercrime. Images of the detainees, who didn't have any known criminal record, showed their faces were badly bruised. The images caused outrage in Russia where many hawkish commentators accused Azerbaijan of treating Russians as hostages and urged a tough response.",
      "Russia on Tuesday briefly detained the leader of the Azerbaijani community in Yekaterinburg for interrogation. A video on Russian social media showed special forces breaking the windows of his vehicle, dragging him and his son out, and making them lie face down on the pavement. A prominent member of the Azerbaijani diaspora also was arrested in Voronezh in southern Russia.",
      "Azerbaijan strongly condemned what it called \u201cthe demonstrative and deliberate acts of extrajudicial killing and violence\u201d by Russian police following the deaths in Yekaterinburg.",
      "After the arrests of the Sputnik employees and other Russians in Baku, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Azerbaijan's ambassador to protest \u201cthe recent unfriendly actions of Baku and the intentional steps of the Azerbaijani side aimed to dismantle bilateral relations.\u201d",
      "Azerbaijan shot back by summoning the Russian ambassador to demand a probe into the deaths, punishment for those responsible and compensation for the victims \u2014 steps it said were \u201ccrucial for eliminating the negative atmosphere in bilateral relations.\u201d It shrugged off Moscow's complaints about the arrests of Russians in Baku",
      "Aliyev discussed the tensions with Russia in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, an act that seemed designed to rile the Kremlin.

      "Dri, a Capuchin friar, died Monday in the Argentine capital, where his funeral was being celebrated Wednesday, the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano said.",
      "Dri was made a cardinal by Francis in 2023 at the age of 96 in recognition of his lifetime of work hearing confessions of the faithful and dispensing merciful absolutions. Up until his death, he worked as the confessor at the Our Lady of Pompeii parish in Buenos Aires.",
      "Francis frequently referred to Dri during his pontificate and held him up as a model confessor for other priests, urging them to always be merciful in the confessional. For Francis, the sacrament of reconciliation was particularly important and he urged priests to always pardon those who seek forgiveness.",
      "He once quoted Dri as saying he was so willing to dispense absolutions because God himself \u201cgave me a bad example\u201d in forgiving all his sins.",
      "Pope Leo XIV, who was made a cardinal during the same consistory as Dri, issued a message of condolences Wednesday signed by the Vatican secretary of state. In it, he recalled Dri as a \u201cdevoted pastor, who was so dear to Pope Francis, and who for so many years gave his life to the service of God and the church as a confessor.\u201d",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s office says Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is secure in her job after a series of government U-turns dented her revenue-raising plans",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s office said Wednesday that Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is secure in her job after a series of government U-turns dented her revenue-raising plans.",
      "Speculation about Reeves\u2019 future mounted after she appeared to be in tears Wednesday in the House of Commons, the day after an embarrassing reversal for the government over its plans to cut welfare spending. Many viewers observed that Reeves looked exhausted and upset as she sat behind Starmer during the weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions session.",
      "The Treasury said Reeves was dealing with a \u201cpersonal matter.\u201d It would not elaborate.",
      "Starmer initially declined to say, when asked by opposition leader Kemi Badenoch, that Reeves would still have her job when the next election is called, likely in 2029.",
      "But Starmer\u2019s press secretary later said Reeves \u201cis going nowhere. She has the prime minister\u2019s full backing.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Starmer\u2019s government was forced to water down plans to curb welfare spending in order to quell a rebellion by lawmakers from his own party.",
      "In something of a hollow victory, the bill passed its first big House of Commons hurdle after the government appeased Labour Party rebels by softening and delaying cuts to welfare benefits for disabled people. Even so, 49 Labour lawmakers voted against the bill.",
      "The result is a major blow to Starmer\u2019s authority as he approaches the one-year anniversary of his election on Friday, reckoning with a sluggish economy and rock-bottom approval ratings.",
      "It also leaves the Treasury short of money it had counted on to invest in public services, making tax increases more likely. The government has promised not to raise key levies including income tax and sales tax.",
      "The government estimated that its welfare reforms would save 5 billion pounds ($7 billion) a year, but after the changes it's unclear whether they will save any money at all.",
      "The reversal follows a decision in May to drop a plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees, which Reeves had also counted on to raise money.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong\u2019s government has proposed a registration system to recognize same-sex partnerships formed overseas",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong\u2019s government on Wednesday proposed a registration system that would recognize same-sex partnerships formed overseas, granting such couples more rights in the city.",
      "In a document submitted to the legislature, the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said the proposed system would allow registration for same-sex adult couples who have married, formed civil partnerships or civil unions overseas, provided these relationships were legally recognized in those jurisdictions and one of them is a Hong Kong resident.",
      "After the registration, the couples would have rights including the ability to participate in medical decisions for their loved ones, provided consent is given. For mentally incapacitated adult patients, their partners can take part in the decisions as guardians.",
      "They would also enjoy the right to handle after-death matters for their partners, including claiming the bodies and deciding whether their remains can be used for medical treatment, education or research.",
      "Same-sex couples cannot get married or register for civil partnerships in Hong Kong. But authorities recognize same-sex marriages registered abroad for taxation and civil service benefits and other practical reasons, such as dependent visas.",
      "Many of the government\u2019s concessions were won through legal challenges and the city has seen growing social acceptance toward same-sex marriage in recent years.",
      "The government proposal came in response to the top court's landmark ruling in 2023 in favor of a framework for recognizing same-sex couples' rights. The ruling did not grant full marriage rights to same-sex couples but was a partial victory for prominent pro-democracy activist Jimmy Sham, who fought a five-year legal battle over the recognition of same-sex marriages registered overseas.",
      "Sham, who was sentenced to over four years for his role in an unofficial primary under a Beijing-imposed national security law, was released from prison in May.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Sham said heterosexual couples were not required to register their marriages overseas to get the recognition locally and questioned why same-sex couples had to do so.",
      "He also suggested that the government allow same-sex couples to enjoy equal prison visiting rights as heterosexual couples.",
      "\u201cI hope the government will listen to opinions from society and the community, and try to develop a solution that doesn\u2019t exceed society\u2019s acceptance level, while meeting the expectations of same-sex couples and avoiding legal challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Jerome Yau, co-founder of non-governmental organization Hong Kong Marriage Equality, said the government document was \u201cvery conservative\u201d and \u201cfar from acceptable.\u201d",
      "He said he failed to see the logic of only making those who are married or have formed partnerships overseas eligible for the measures.",
      "\u201cWe believe that will create an obvious inequality in the sense of local same-sex couples who are not married overseas won't be eligible to register the relationships. I think that\u2019s unfair, and potentially that will lead to further litigation,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped the bill would come with more details.",
      "The government is expected to table a bill in the legislature at a later date. Lawmakers will discuss the document on Thursday.",
      "Some pro-Beijing legislators have spoken out against granting same-sex couples equal rights, upholding the traditional view that marriage should only be between men and women.",
      "The government said its proposals were made after considering the city\u2019s actual situation, adding that there are different views over the recognition of same sex partnerships and it would have to strike a balance to avoid dividing society.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's Emperor Naruhito said Wednesday that he will honor thousands of Japanese prisoners of World War II who were held under harsh conditions in Mongolia when he visits the country next week.",
      "Naruhito, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, has been visiting some of the places where the bloodiest battles and bombings occurred, including Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Hiroshima. It's part of his effort at atonement and remembrance of the tragedy of war fought in the name of his grandfather, Emperor Hirohito.",
      "\u201cI will pay tribute to the Japanese people who unwillingly died in the distant land away from home, and think of their hardships,\u201d Naruhito said at a news conference ahead of his July 6-13 trip to Mongolia. His Harvard-educated former diplomat wife, Empress Masako, will accompany him.",
      "Just before the end of the hostilities in 1945, the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan, taking most of about 575,000 Japanese POWs to Siberia. But around 12,000 to 14,000 of them were taken to Mongolia, which was fighting alongside the Soviets against Japan.",
      "Most of the POWs were put to hard labor and construction work for the Mongolian government's headquarters, a state university and a theater that are still preserved in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The prisoners toiled under harsh conditions and scarce food. Japanese records show about 1,700 of them died in Mongolia.",
      "\u201cAs we mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the war this year, we should never forget the pain and sorrow of the people,\u201d Naruhito said. \u201cI believe it is important to not forget those who died, deepen understanding of the wartime past and to nurture the peace-loving heart.\u201d",
      "Naruhito has repeatedly stressed the importance of telling the war's tragedy to younger generations, pledging to contribute to efforts to promote the understanding of history and the determination for peace.",

    "story": [
      "The debate in the Catholic Church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass is heating up just as Pope Leo XIV\u2019s pontificate is getting under way",
      "ROME -- The debate in the Catholic Church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass is heating up just as Pope Leo XIV\u2019s pontificate is getting under way, with the apparent leak of Vatican documents that undermine the stated reason of his predecessor Pope Francis for restricting access to the ancient liturgy.",
      "The documents suggest that the majority of Catholic bishops who responded to a 2020 Vatican survey about the Latin Mass had expressed general satisfaction with it, and warned that restricting it would \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d",
      "The texts from the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office were posted online Tuesday by a Vatican reporter who has followed the Latin Mass dispute, Diane Montagna. The Vatican spokesman and prefect of the doctrine office didn\u2019t immediately respond when asked Wednesday to confirm their authenticity, or comment.",
      "If confirmed, the documents could add pressure on Leo to try to pacify the liturgical divisions that spread, especially in the United States, during Francis\u2019 12-year papacy. Since the start of his pontificate, Leo has said his aim is unity and reconciliation in the church, and many conservatives and traditionalists have pointed to the Latin Mass dispute as an area that requires urgent resolution.",
      "In one of his most controversial acts, Francis in 2021 reversed Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s signature liturgical legacy and restricted access for ordinary Catholics to the old Latin Mass. The ancient liturgy was celebrated around the world before the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council, which allowed Mass to be celebrated in the vernacular, with the priest facing the pews.",
      "Francis said he was cracking down on the spread of the old liturgy because Benedict\u2019s decision in 2007 to relax restrictions had become a source of division in the church. Francis said at the time he was responding to \u201cthe wishes expressed\u201d by bishops around the world who had responded to the Vatican survey, as well as the Vatican doctrine office\u2019s own opinion.",
      "\u201cThe responses reveal a situation that preoccupies and saddens me, and persuades me of the need to intervene,\u201d Francis wrote at the time. Benedict's relaxation had been \"exploited to widen the gaps, reinforce the divergences, and encourage disagreements that injure the church, block her path, and expose her to the peril of division,\u201d he said.",
      "The documents posted online, however, paint a different picture. They suggest the majority of bishops who responded to the Vatican survey had a generally favorable view of Benedict\u2019s reform and warned that suppressing or weakening it would lead traditionalist Catholics to leave the church and join schismatic groups. They warned any changes \u201cwould seriously damage the life of the church, as it would recreate the tensions that the document had helped to resolve.\u201d",
      "The documents include a five-page \u201coverall assessment\u201d of the survey findings, written by the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office, as well as a seven-page compilation of quotes from individual bishops or bishops\u2019 conferences.",
      "The documents contain some negative and neutral opinions, and say some bishops considered Benedict\u2019s reform \u201cinappropriate, disturbing,\u201d dangerous and worthy of suppression. But the Vatican's own assessment said the majority of bishops who responded expressed satisfaction. It cited the rise in religious vocations in traditionalist communities and said young Catholics in particular were drawn to the \u201csacredness, seriousness and solemnity of the liturgy.\u201d",
      "It's not clear what other evidence, anecdotes or documentation informed Francis\u2019 decision to reverse Benedict. But from the very start, Francis was frequently critical of traditionalist Catholics, whom he accused of being navel-gazing retrogrades out of touch with the evangelizing mission of the church in the 21st century.",
      "The new documents have comforted traditionalists who felt attacked and abandoned by Francis.",
      "\u201cThe new revelations confirms that Pope Francis restricted the Traditional Mass at the request of only a minority of bishops, and against the advice of the dicastery in charge of the subject,\u201d said Joseph Shaw, of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales. \u201cThe majority view of the bishops, that restricting the TLM would cause more harm than good, has sadly been proved correct.\u201d",
      "In an email, he said Leo should address the issue \u201curgently.\u201d",

They have witnessed an increasingly alarming spike of confrontations in the waters in recent years, with China using water cannons and dangerous maneuvers to defend its claim to the global trade route.",
      "China blames the Philippines for instigating the clashes. A 2016 international arbitration decision invalidated China\u2019s claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, but Beijing has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.",
      "\u0160akalien\u0117 said that in the Baltic Sea, Chinese ships and crew members have helped suspected Russian fleets damage undersea oil pipelines, and data and electricity cables belonging to rival European nations like Lithuania by dragging steel anchors on the seafloor.

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A relentless European heat wave helped fuel a deadly wildfire in Spain while the European Union presented plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under scorching temperatures on Wednesday.",
      "The blaze that broke out late on Tuesday created an enormous thick plume of ash and smoke that reached 14,000 meters (45,000 feet) of altitude, making it the largest registered by firefighters in Catalonia, a northeastern region of Spain.",
      "Two farmers were killed while apparently trying to flee in a vehicle, local authorities said Wednesday.",
      "Firefighters said that the fire spread at 28 kph (17 mph) at one point as it consumed 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) mostly of grain fields, making it one of the fastest fires registered in Europe.",
      "\u201cWildfires today are not like they were before,\u201d Salvador Illa, the regional president of Catalonia, said. \u201cThese are extremely dangerous. From the very first moment, it was considered to be beyond the capacity of extinction. I mean that not even with two or three times the number of firefighters, they have told me, it would have been possible to put out.\u201d",
      "Firefighters credited a rainstorm later on Tuesday for having \u201cquickly changed the situation and helped speed up getting the fire stabilized.\u201d",
      "Two of the 500 firefighters who deployed needed treatment at a local hospital for their injuries. Some 14,000 residents were ordered to stay indoors for several hours on Tuesday night.",
      "More hot weather is expected on Wednesday with temperatures in the Lleida region forecast to reach a high of 39 C (102 F).",
      "The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts said that it was closely monitoring the abnormally hot temperatures. Weather experts link the heat wave to climate change.",
      "As much of Europe was scorched by torrid weather, the European Commission unveiled proposals to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040 as the 27-nation bloc aims to be fully carbon-neutral by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe are finally here on a very hot day, and some would call that very timely,\u201d Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters in Brussels.",
      "The proposals include allowing businesses to use international carbon credits to offset their emissions. Under the plan, international carbon credits could be used \u2014 starting in 2036 and limited to 3% of benchmark 1990 EU emissions \u2014 to reach the 2040 emission reduction target.",
      "The proposals have to be approved by the EU\u2019s 27 member states.",

      "Experts say higher surface temperatures are bad for sea life and make for warmer nights on shore.",
      "\u201cA much warmer sea around us contributes to the nights not cooling down, which is detrimental to people\u2019s rest,\u201d Manuel Vargas, researcher at the Oceanographic Center of Malaga, told The Associated Press.",
      "Also in Spain's southern city of Malaga, the international Red Cross set up an air-conditioned \u201cclimate refuge\u201d to help residents. The Spanish Red Cross was itself providing an \u201cassisted bathing service\u201d to help people with reduced mobility to cool down in waters at the beach.",
      "Heat alerts were issued for 17 Italian cities Wednesday. The corresponding surge in air conditioning was straining the electric grid and causing periodic blackouts. On Tuesday, parts of Florence\u2019s historic center had a blackout following a surge in electricity use, energy company Enel said.",
      "Italy\u2019s labor ministry, meanwhile, summoned union representatives to a meeting Wednesday to finalize a protocol on protecting farm, construction and other workers who labor outdoors from heat exposure. This came after a construction worker died in Bologna this week.",

    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s president has ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American and Israeli airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities, likely further limiting inspectors' ability to track Tehran's program that had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "The order by President Masoud Pezeshkian included no timetables or details about what that suspension would entail. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi signaled in a CBS News interview that Tehran still would be willing to continue negotiations with the United States.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\u201d Araghchi said, referring to Trump's comments that talks could start as early as this week. However, he added: \u201cThe doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\u201d",
      "Iran has limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West \u2014 though as of right now Tehran has denied that there's any immediate plans to resume talks with the United States that had been upended by the 12-day Iran-Israel war.",
      "Iranian state television announced Pezeshkian's order, which followed a law passed by Iran\u2019s parliament to suspend that cooperation. The bill already received the approval of Iran's constitutional watchdog, the Guardian Council, on Thursday, and likely the support of the country's Supreme National Security Council, which Pezeshkian chairs.",
      "\u201cThe government is mandated to immediately suspend all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its related Safeguards Agreement,\u201d state television quoted the bill as saying. \"This suspension will remain in effect until certain conditions are met, including the guaranteed security of nuclear facilities and scientists.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that would mean for the Vienna-based IAEA, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog. The agency long has monitored Iran\u2019s nuclear program and said that it was waiting for an official communication from Iran on what the suspension meant.",
      "A diplomat with knowledge of IAEA operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation in Iran, said that IAEA inspectors were still there after the announcement and hadn\u2019t been told by the government to leave.",
      "Iran's decision drew an immediate condemnation from Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar.",
      "\u201cIran has just issued a scandalous announcement about suspending its cooperation with the IAEA,\u201d he said in an X post. \u201cThis is a complete renunciation of all its international nuclear obligations and commitments.\u201d",
      "Saar urged European nations that were part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal to implement its so-called snapback clause. That would reimpose all U.N. sanctions on it originally lifted by Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, if one of its Western parties declares the Islamic Republic is out of compliance with it.",
      "Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, and the IAEA doesn't have access to its weapons-related facilities.",
      "Iran's move so far stops short of what experts feared the most. They had been concerned that Tehran, in response to the war, could decide to fully end its cooperation with the IAEA, abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rush toward a bomb. That treaty has countries agree not to build or obtain nuclear weapons and allows the IAEA to conduct inspections to verify that countries correctly declared their programs.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% \u2014 enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight. The IAEA served as the main assessor of Iran's commitment to the deal.",
      "But U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in 2018, unilaterally withdrew Washington from the accord, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough and didn\u2019t address Iran\u2019s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "Israeli airstrikes, which began June 13, decimated the upper ranks of Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guard and targeted its arsenal of ballistic missiles. The strikes also hit Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, which Israel claimed put Tehran within reach of a nuclear weapon.",
      "Iran has said the Israeli attacks killed 935 \u201cIranian citizens,\u201d including 38 children and 102 women. However, Iran has a long history of offering lower death counts around unrest over political considerations.",
      "The Washington-based Human Rights Activists group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, has put the death toll at 1,190 people killed, including 436 civilians and 435 security force members. The attacks wounded another 4,475 people, the group said.",
      "Meanwhile, it appears that Iranian officials now are assessing the damage done by the American strikes conducted on the three nuclear sites on June 22, including those at Fordo, a site built under a mountain about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tehran.",
      "Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show Iranian officials at Fordo on Monday likely examining the damage caused by American bunker busters. Trucks could be seen in the images, as well as at least one crane and an excavator at tunnels on the site. That corresponded to images shot Sunday by Maxar Technologies similarly showing the ongoing work.",

      "Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a tough test in an upper house election this month as his minority government struggles after its major defeat in last year\u2019s snap election",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a tough test in an upper house election later this month as his minority government struggles after its major defeat in last year's snap election.",
      "Ishiba has survived so far, though he had to make some concessions to the opposition \u2014 an unusual step for the Liberal Democratic Party that has dominated Japan\u2019s postwar politics.",
      "Official campaigning begins Thursday for the July 20 vote for the upper house, the less powerful of Japan\u2019s two parliamentary chambers.",
      "Ishiba has modest goals for the election and the opposition is divided, so the outcome is unlikely to force an immediate change of government. But it will be a tough test on Ishiba\u2019s handling of economic woes at home and global challenges such as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war.",
      "\u201cI will defend Japan\u2019s national interest at all cost,\u201d Ishiba said Wednesday, reiterating his determination to not make any concession on safety or other areas in the tariff negotiations despite Trump\u2019s new threat. \u201cJapan has its own national interest and I will do my utmost to protect it.\u201d",
      "Ishiba\u2019s goal is a simple majority. Half of the 248 seats for six-year terms in the upper house are being decided, and the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito would need to win 50 combined. That's on top of their 75 seats that are not being contested in this election.",
      "That would be a retreat from their current number of 141 seats. \u201cIt won't be easy. But in this difficult situation, it is a must-attain goal,\" Ishiba said Wednesday, without saying how he would take responsibility if he doesn't meet his goal.",
      "A poor result in the upper house election would not immediately cause a change of government but could trigger a LDP leadership change or regrouping of a governing coalition.",
      "The LDP was defeated in the previous election largely because many of its usual supporters voted for centrist to conservative opposition groups to punish the governing party over its corruption scandals. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, and the surging Democratic Party for the People, or DPP, as well as an emerging right-wing populist Sanseito have significantly gained ground.",
      "But the opposition groups are too fractured to find a common platform to gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "When Ishiba lost big in October, there was speculation of a trilateral coalition government with the DPP or another conservative Japan Innovation Party, but they have cooperated only on certain legislation. A loss of majority in the upper house by Ishiba\u2019s party could reignite momentum for coalition regroupings.",
      "Opposition CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda has said a loss of majority in both houses would help opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP, such as consumption tax cuts.",
      "Measures to mitigate soaring prices, dwindling wages and burdens of social security payment are the top focus of frustrated voters hit by economic woes.",
      "Ishiba\u2019s handling of the recent rice panic will be tested. Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan\u2019s farming policies, adding to consumer concern and frustration.",
      "The rice crisis cost Ishiba's government one farm minister, but the replacement, Shinjiro Koizumi, took rapid and bold measures including the unprecedented release of emergency reserves that brought the staple back to normal prices, just in time for the election.",
      "In another setback, Trump complained about little progress in trade negotiations with Ishiba's government, saying Japan is not only not buying automobiles, but is also not buying enough U.S. rice despite its rice shortage.",
      "While NATO leaders recently adopted a massive hike in defense spending after pressure from Trump, Ishiba said Japan should make its own decision on any such spending.",
      "Ishiba\u2019s party adopted a campaign platform that included cash payouts to cushion the impact of inflation and dwindling wages, which opposition parties criticized as pork. The main opposition CDPJ calls for increased welfare spending, while DPP focuses on wage increase.",
      "Ishiba also needs to offset consumer worries over uncertainty in the Middle East and its impact on energy costs.",

      "An emboldened Russia has ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- An emboldened Russia has ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine, scattering Kyiv\u2019s precious reserve troops and threatening to expand the fighting to a new Ukrainian region as each side seeks an advantage before the fighting season wanes in the autumn.",
      "Moscow aims to maximize its territorial gains before seriously considering a full ceasefire, analysts and military commanders said. Ukraine wants to slow the Russian advance for as long as possible and extract heavy losses.",
      "Kremlin forces are steadily gaining ground in the strategic eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, the capture of which would hand them a major battlefield victory and bring them closer to acquiring the entire Donetsk region. The fighting there has also brought combat to the border of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time.",
      "In an effort to prevent Moscow from bolstering those positions in the east, Ukrainian forces are trying to pin down some of Russia\u2019s best and most battle-hardened troops hundreds of kilometers away, in the northeast Sumy region.",
      "\u201cThe best-case scenario for Ukraine,\" said Russian-British military historian Sergey Radchenko, \"is that they\u2019re able to stall or stop the Russian advance\" in the Ukrainian industrial heartland known as Donbas, which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Then Ukraine could \"use that as the basis for a ceasefire agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a better chance for Russia to come to some kind of terms with Ukraine\" in the fall when the Russians \"see the extent of their offensive,\u201d Radchenko added.",
      "While the battles rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is waiting to learn whether the Trump administration will support tougher sanctions against Russia and back a European idea to establish a \u201creassurance force\u201d to deter Moscow.",
      "A setback came with the U.S. decision Tuesday to halt some weapons shipments to Ukraine out of concern over America's own depleted stockpiles.",
      "In the Sumy region, Ukrainian forces face a constant barrage of aerial glide bombs, drones and relentless assaults by small groups of Russian infantrymen. They endure the attacks to prevent Russian forces from being moved to other battlegrounds in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Ukrainian forces intensified their own attacks in Sumy in April and even conducted a small offensive into Russia's neighboring Kursk region to prevent up to 60,000 battle-hardened Russian forces from being moved to reinforce positions in the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Ukraine\u2019s top army commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last week.",
      "If those troops had been moved, they could have increased the tempo of Russian attacks across the front line and stretched Ukrainian forces thin.",
      "The strategy did not come without criticism. Commanders who were ordered to execute it complained that it resulted in unnecessary loss of life.",
      "Russian forces have penetrated up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) into the northern Sumy region from different directions along the border.",
      "Ukrainian forces are determined to keep them there to avoid freeing up Russian forces to fight in the east. So far they have succeeded, locking up to 10,000 Russian troops in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region alone, where Ukraine maintains a small presence after being mostly forced out by Russian and North Korean troops earlier in the year.",
      "The war's largest battle is being waged in Donetsk as Russia inches toward its stated goal of capturing all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.",
      "Unable to tackle the strategically significant logistical hub of Pokrovsk directly, Russian forces are attempting to encircle the city, a maneuver that requires encroaching on the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Bringing the war to a sixth Ukrainian region would be detrimental for Ukrainian morale and give Russia more leverage in negotiations if its forces manage to carve out a foothold there.",
      "Sabotage groups have crossed the border, only to be eliminated by Ukrainian forces.",
      "But in time, commanders fear that Russia will advance as Ukraine continues to grapple with severe shortages.",
      "Lack of soldiers and supplies across the 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) front line mean that Ukrainian forces must concentrate on holding their positions and conserving resources rather than advancing, said Oleksii Makhrinskyi, deputy commander of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion.",
      "Commanders describe battles so intense under drone-saturated skies that rotating forces in and out of position has become a deadly operation. Ukrainian forces remain in combat positions for several weeks at a time or more, relying on supplies carried in by drones.",
      "The Russians' goal \"is just to enter Dnipropetrovsk region, to have a good position politically if the presidents negotiate peace,\u201d said Andrii Nazerenko, a commander of the 72nd Brigade, a drone unit in eastern Ukraine, referring to potential talks between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re really close to getting what they want,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy hopes U.S. President Donald Trump will move away from his administration's past ambivalence toward Ukraine and signal his intention to continue American support, a move that could also alter Moscow\u2019s calculations.",
      "The two presidents met last week on the sidelines of a NATO summit and discussed a possible weapons package, including Patriot missile systems that Ukraine intends to purchase with European support.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department announcement now calls that into question although it did not specify which weapons were being held back when it disclosed the Pentagon review of American weapons stockpiles Tuesday. The halt of any weapons from the U.S. would be a blow to Ukraine as it struggles to confront Russia\u2019s daily aerial barrages.",
      "Zelenskyy also hopes Trump will punish Russia by imposing harsher sanctions on its energy and banking sectors, which bankroll the Kremlin\u2019s war effort.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have imposed successive sanctions on Russia since the full-scale invasion in 2022, but Zelenskyy says those measures have not been enough to pierce Moscow\u2019s war machine. He has proposed a $30 per barrel price cap on Russian oil.",
      "EU sanctions envoy David O\u2019Sullivan said Europe needs to maintain the sanctions pressure while also \u201cholding out the prospect that if Russia behaves correctly, we could have some kind of ceasefire and some kind of sense of negotiation, but for the moment Russia doesn\u2019t seem to want that.\u201d",
      "Kyiv\u2019s closest European allies are also awaiting a sign from Trump that he will support a plan to deploy foreign troops in Ukraine to guard against future Russian aggression after a ceasefire agreement. That is likely the best security guarantee Ukraine can hope for in lieu of NATO membership.",
      "Meanwhile on the battlefield, Russian forces appear increasingly confident.",
      "Nazerenko noticed a shift in the morale of advancing Russian infantrymen in recent months. Instead of running away while being assailed by Ukrainian drones, they keep pushing forward.",
      "Nazerenko could not help but ask a Russian prisoner: \u201cYou know you will die. Why go?\u201d",
      "Because, the Russian soldier replied: \u201cWe will win.\u201d",

      "Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has said the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending speculation ignited by his remark that he might be the last person to hold the role",
      "DHARAMSHALA, India -- Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday said the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that started when he indicated that he might be the last person to hold the role.",
      "Speaking at prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signalling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama\u2019s succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China\u2019s tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China\u2019s Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\u201d he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \u201caccordance with past tradition.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday about the Dalai Lama's announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing said \u201cthe reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\u201d and \"approval by the central government.\u201d",
      "Mao said the process must \u201cfollow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Separately, Amnesty International\u2019s China Director, Sarah Brooks, in a statement Wednesday said the efforts by Chinese authorities to control the selection of the next Dalai Lama was a \u201cdirect assault\u201d on the right to freedom of religion.",
      "\u201cTibetan Buddhists, like all faith communities, must be able to choose their spiritual leaders without coercion or interference by the authorities,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \u201can earnest request with single-minded devotion\u201d that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \u201cfor the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\u201cIn response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\u201d he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \u201cunique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe not only strongly condemn the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\u201d he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama\u2019s reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent\u2019s death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian domestic flight was delayed for two hours after a stowaway snake was found in the plane\u2019s cargo hold, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "The snake was found on Tuesday as passengers were boarding Virgin Australia Flight VA337 at Melbourne Airport bound for Brisbane, according to snake catcher Mark Pelley.",
      "The snake turned out to be a harmless 60-centimeter (2-foot) green tree snake. But Pelly said he thought it could be venomous when he approached it in the darkened hold.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after I caught the snake that I realized that it wasn\u2019t venomous. Until that point, it looked very dangerous to me,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s most venomous snakes are native to Australia.",
      "When Pelley entered the cargo hold, the snake was half hidden behind a panel and could have disappeared deeper into the plane.",
      "Pelley said he told an aircraft engineer and airline staff that they would have to evacuate the aircraft if the snake disappeared inside the plane.",
      "\u201cI said to them if I don\u2019t get this in one shot, it\u2019s going to sneak through the panels and you\u2019re going to have to evacuate the plane because at that stage I did not know what kind of snake it was,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "\u201cBut thankfully, I got it on the first try and captured it,\u201d Pelley added. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get it that first time, the engineers and I would be pulling apart a (Boeing) 737 looking for a snake still right now.\u201d",
      "Pelley said he had taken 30 minutes to drive to the airport and was then delayed by security before he could reach the airliner.",
      "An airline official said the flight was delayed around two hours.",
      "Because the snake is native to the Brisbane region, Pelley suspects it came aboard inside a passenger\u2019s luggage and escaped during the two-hour flight from Brisbane to Melbourne.",
      "For quarantine reasons, the snake can\u2019t be returned to the wild.",
      "The snake, which is a protected species, has been given to a Melbourne veterinarian to find a home with a licensed snake keeper.",

      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants earmarked for immigrants\u2019 children and low-income students to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, typically is a coldlike nuisance, but it can be severe, even life-threatening, for infants and older adults.

      "In April, the CDC\u2019s influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended expanding RSV vaccination to high-risk adults as young as 50, too. But the CDC lacks a director to decide whether to adopt that recommendation and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn\u2019t immediately act.",

      "On Wednesday, a page on CDC's website said that on June 25, Kennedy had adopted the ousted panel's recommendation to expand RSV vaccination to high-risk 50-somethings and it is \u201cnow an official recommendation of the CDC.\u201d",

Trump promptly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations like the one with Vietnam. The pause expires Tuesday, but so far the Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with only one of those countries \u2014 the United Kingdom.

We can do that. It's the big countries that everybody's keeping their eyes on.'' She doubts that Trump will be able to impose such a lopsided agreement on big trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.",
      "The United States last year ran a $122 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. That was the third-biggest U.S. trade gap \u2014 the difference between the goods and services it buys from other countries and those it sells them \u2014 behind the ones with China and Mexico.",
      "In addition to the 20% tariffs, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 40% tax on \"transshipping'' \u2014 goods from another country that stop in Vietnam on their way to the United States. Washington complains that Chinese goods have been dodging higher U.S. tariffs by transiting through Vietnam.",

      "Reporting in Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria was tough work for reporter Jane Ferguson",
      "NEW YORK -- Jane Ferguson has won awards for unflinching reporting from dangerous lands including Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. So she was unlikely to be intimidated by seeking financing for a new journalism platform, despite tough times for the news industry.",
      "\u201cIt's very high pressure,\u201d said Ferguson, founder of Noosphere. \u201cI'm used to pressure in the field.\u201d",
      "Started this year, Noosphere offers journalists a place to showcase work to consumers who are attracted by a more personal style of reporting than they'd normally see on traditional outlets.",
      "It's similar to Substack, with a twist. Instead of paying for feeds of individual journalists \u2014 the Substack model \u2014 people who subscribe to Noosphere for $14.99 a month get access to all of its journalists. There are 20 so far, expected to increase to 24 with the site's upcoming British launch.",
      "Noosphere \u2014 named to reference a state of consciousness advanced by Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 arrives at a time of flux in the news industry. Consumers are fleeing newspapers and television news and trying different approaches springing up in a new media world.",
      "Ferguson raised $1 million to get Noosphere off the ground and is about to announce an additional round of investment.",
      "Ferguson, 40, grew up in Northern Ireland, and was attracted to the high-stakes, high-risk world of international reporting. For CNN International and then PBS NewsHour, she worked largely alone, covering stories about famine and war crimes in South Sudan, the conflict in Syria and Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.",
      "The latter experience left her shell-shocked and heartbroken, wondering if she'd reached the end of that phase of her career. \u201cI had been on the road for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI was exhausted, and in some respects, burnt out.\u201d",
      "She settled in the United States, teaching \u2014 and learning \u2014 at Princeton. She took classes in entrepreneurship and built contacts in the business world. Ferguson knew how many of her former international colleagues had to hustle to find outlets for their work, and envisioned Noosphere as a landing spot. Her business partner, Seb Walker, worked at Vice Media, known for its strong international reporting before filing for bankruptcy in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt's gotten a lot harder to continue making a living doing this,\u201d said Matthew Cassell, an international correspondent whose credits include Vice. A member of Noosphere's inaugural class of journalists, Cassell has posted videos giving his perspectives on the Israel-Iran war, along with recent reporting from the West Bank.",
      "Shrouq Al Aila contributed video from Gaza, showing efforts to distribute aid as the sound of gunfire is heard in the background. Oren Ziv reported from a missile strike in Israel, walking through a hospital's shattered hallways to show the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a really high-quality reporter is Face-Timing you from the field,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwhich is really cool.\u201d",
      "News consumers, particularly young ones, are souring on more stilted, conventional television news reporting, said veteran journalist Kate O'Brian, who is on Noosphere's board of directors. \u201cThe stage has been set for an audience who wants to hear directly from the journalist,\u201d O'Brian said.",
      "Ferguson envisions a reporting staff that is roughly half international, half based in the United States. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza reports on Washington for Noosphere.",
      "Her biggest signing to date is former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd. He started a Sunday night show in June, with \u201cWar Room\u201d host Steve Bannon and Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, as his first guests. Todd has hired the former producer for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, a clue to his ambitions for an eclectic show interviewing interesting people from politics and business.",
      "\u201cJane's hard to say no to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cLike any smart executive, she knows what she doesn't know, and goes to find smart people who she thinks know more.\"",
      "Ferguson's bet is that audiences can only afford so many Substack subscriptions to individual journalists, and that Noosphere will offer access to more at a set price. She's also talked to news outlets interested in acquiring some of the reporters' work.",
      "The challenge to getting Noosphere established is an increasingly crowded marketplace, and several of her journalists aren't household names.",
      "Noosphere journalists are paid a percentage of subscription fees, and given a greater amount if a subscriber specifically cites that contributor's work in signing on. Ferguson will not say how many subscribers she has yet.",
      "\u201cSubstack created a market that did not exist before and I give them huge kudos for that,\u201d O'Brian said. \u201cThis is just a different way of approaching it.\u201d",
      "To succeed, \u201cyou have to offer a lot,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can't just offer one or two things. Every hot spot around the world, Noosphere will have journalists on the ground. They have a reasonable chance to be very successful in their lane. The question is how big the lane can get.\u201d",
      "Todd said Noosphere's advantage is that it has been created by reporters, a distinction from the lack of journalism experience found among executives in the business, he said.",
      "Ferguson, too, has wondered whether journalism can survive the diminishment or death of news organizations. \u201cThe solution for the problems of the industry are going to come from journalists and not media executives,\u201d she said.",

      "An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- An analysis finds that a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans, a sum that could be potentially managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.",
      "The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category that includes roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand \u2014 and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president.",
      "The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump\u2019s import taxes, contradicting his claims that foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.",
      "The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to instead schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would have faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.",
      "Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: \u201cEverything\u2019s going well.\u201d",
      "The president has indicated that he will set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. India and Vietnam have signaled that they\u2019re close to a trade framework.",
      "There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report that it expects companies to pass along 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses\u2019 inflation expectations to say that companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.",
      "The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest that the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted that companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and that wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins that they might need to spread the tariffs costs to their customers.",
      "The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday interview that the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.",
      "\u201cPeople who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Bessent said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
      "The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.",

      "The blaze that broke out late on Tuesday created an enormous thick plume of ash and smoke that reached 14,000 meters (45,000 feet) of altitude, making it the largest registered by firefighters in Catalonia, a northeastern region of Spain.",
      "Two farmers were killed while apparently trying to flee in a vehicle, local authorities said Wednesday.",
      "Firefighters said that the fire spread at 28 kph (17 mph) at one point as it consumed 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) mostly of grain fields, making it one of the fastest fires registered in Europe.",
      "\u201cWildfires today are not like they were before,\u201d Salvador Illa, the regional president of Catalonia, said. \u201cThese are extremely dangerous. From the very first moment, it was considered to be beyond the capacity of extinction.

      "It does not.",
      "At best, Trump's \u201cno tax on Social Security\u201d claim exaggerates the benefits to seniors if either the House or Senate-passed proposals is signed into law.",
      "Here's a look at Trump's recent statements, and what the proposals would \u2014 or would not \u2014 do.",
      "Trump repeatedly told voters during his 2024 campaign that he would eliminate taxes on Social Security. As his massive legislative package has moved through Congress, the Republican president has claimed that's what the bill would do.",
      "Trump said on a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\" that the bill includes \u201cno tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime.\u201d",

Those who won't be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don\u2019t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.",
      "The Senate proposal includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65, contrasted with the House proposal, which includes a temporary deduction of $4,000.",
      "The Senate proposal approved Tuesday would eliminate Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.",

      "Touting a new Council of Economic Advisers analysis, the White House said Tuesday that \u201c88% of all seniors who receive Social Security \u2014 will pay NO TAX on their Social Security benefits,\" going on to say that the Senate proposal\u2019s $6,000 senior deduction \u201cis estimated to benefit 33.9 million seniors, including seniors not claiming Social Security. The deduction yields an average increase in after-tax income of $670 per senior who benefits from it.\u201d",
      "Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation think tank, said conflating the tax deduction with a claim that there will be no tax on Social Security could end up confusing and angering a lot of seniors who will expect to not pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.",

      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Koreans swam, rode water park slides and enjoyed other water activities at a newly opened mammoth beach resort, state media reported Wednesday, as the country largely maintains a ban on the entry of foreign tourists.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma eastern coastal tourist zone, which North Korea says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the heart of leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s struggling economy. But prospects for the resort, the biggest tourist complex in North Korea, aren\u2019t clear, as the country won\u2019t likely fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon, observers say.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported the Wonsan-Kalma area began service Tuesday, drawing a large number of North Koreans who enjoyed open water swimming, slides and other attractions at a water park and various water activities in the area.",
      "\u201cThe guests\u2019 hearts were filled with overwhelming emotion as they felt the astonishing new heights of our-style tourism culture blossoming under the era of the Workers\u2019 Party,\" KCNA said in a typical propaganda-driven dispatch.",
      "Photos released by North Korean state media showed children with tubes and inflatable balls dipping into the sea, while others in colorful swimsuits beamed while sitting beneath red-and-white parasols.",
      "Kim said at the inaugural ceremony last week the site would be recorded as \u201cone of the greatest successes this year\" and called its opening \u201cthe proud first step\u201d toward realizing the government\u2019s policy of developing tourism.",
      "Since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn\u2019t said whether and when it would fully resume international tourism.",
      "Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled while there are questions about ties between the two socialist neighbors. In February this year, North Korea allowed a small group of international tourists to visit its northeastern border city of Rason, only to stop that tour program in less than a month.",
      "Since February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid expanding military cooperation between the countries. But Russian government records seen by South Korean experts show a little more than 2,000 Russians, only about 880 of them tourists, visited North Korea last year, a number that is too small to revive North Korea's tourism.",
      "Russia\u2019s Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said last week that the first group of Russian tourists to the Wonsan-Kalma resort will depart on July 7 for a eight-day trip that includes a visit to Pyongyang.",

      "The White House said Trump's nominees for the federal utility are Tennesseans Lee Beaman, Mitch Graves and Jeff Hagood; and Randall Jones of Alabama.",
      "The selections follow Trump's firing of three Biden-nominated board members since late March. The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump's picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them.",
      "Without a quorum, TVA's board can take actions needed for ongoing operations but cannot jump into new areas of activity, start new programs or change the utility's existing direction.",

They wrote that studies and hurdles under the TVA board were bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular nuclear reactor.",

      "Less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories are just about everywhere these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Fashion \u201cdupes,\u201d or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles.",
      "In the latest example, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel.",
      "Across the retail industry, it\u2019s far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Herm\u00e8s' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There\u2019s a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas.",
      "It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday\u2019s complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful of companies have \u201creplicated or copied\u201d its apparel to sell cheaper offerings \u2014 including those popularized online through hashtags like \u201cLululemonDupes\u201d on TikTok and other social media platforms.",
      "For years, companies have rolled out a range of cheaper option for consumers to buy instead of pricey name-brands or designer labels \u2014 often through retailers' house or generic brands. Unlike more direct copies of the product with an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, \u201cpure\u201d dupes that just resemble certain features are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items.",
      "But the rising frenzy for dupes, particularly in the fashion space, signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing.",
      "Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Herm\u00e8s\u2019 coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item \u2014 sold by Kamugo, which doesn\u2019t appear to have its own website \u2014 was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a \u201cwirkin.\u201d Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart\u2019s site selling similar totes.",
      "While popular among shoppers, these kind of look-alikes can frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the \u201cwirkin,\u201d Herm\u00e8s Executive Chairman Axel Dumas shared his annoyance, for example.",
      "\u201cMaking a copy like this is quite detestable,\u201d Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was \u201cquite touching\u201d to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style \u2014 and that \u201cdifference in quality\u201d was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Herm\u00e8s.",
      "Alexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, said that \u201cthe term \u2018dupe\u2019 itself doesn\u2019t tell us much about legality,\" noting the word has also been used to describe more traditional counterfeits.",
      "But overall, dupes can move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly if a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original.",
      "\u201cWith fashion, in particular, we\u2019re going to get into some thorny questions,\" Roberts said. That includes what intellectual property rights exist and how enforceable they are, she explained, and whether there is actual infringement or if a product is just \u201cpositioning itself as a less expensive alternative.\u201d",
      "Often such disputes boil down trademark questions around consumer confusion or patented product designs. Several businesses have already put this to the test, but not always successfully.",
      "In December, for example, Benefit lost a lawsuit in California over E.l.f.'s $6 Lash \u2019N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit\u2019s $29 Roller Lash mascara. The judge\u2019s decision was \u201ca resounding win for us,\u201d E.lf. CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an E.l.f. product that\u2019s a much better value.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had \u201cunlawfully traded\u201d on Lululemon\u2019s reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement \u201cdirected to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.\u201d",
      "Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several products, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men\u2019s Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco\u2019s website showing the item priced at $19.97.",
      "Roberts said she was \u201ca little skeptical\u201d of some of Lululemon's claims, noting that the design patents in particular could be hard to challenge. And she pointed to Lululemon's asserting common law trade dress over a \u201ctriangle kind of shape in the crotch region\u201d of the ABC pants.",
      "\u201cMy first reaction as a trademark expert is that looks pretty functional,\u201d she said, and functional matter is not protected under trademark law. \u201cI was just cracking up because that particular claim seemed really far-fetched to me. Those pants look really basic.\"",
      "Still, Roberts noted that Lululemon had some plausible claims.",
      "Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't clearly reveal that information to customers. Due to this, Lululemon claims some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the \u201coriginal\u201d products.",
      "Roberts said this could rule in Lululemon's favor as something that \u201cweighs toward consumer confusion.\u201d Still, she noted that most of the products Lululemon mentioned in its complaint weren't sold under the Kirkland brand, which could undermine the argument.",
      "A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit.",
      "Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged \u201ccopycat products\u201d in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.",

      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was blocking transactions between U.S. banks and Mexican branches of CIBanco and Intercam Banco, as well as the brokering firm Vector Casa de Bolsa. All three have fiercely rejected the claims.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum accused U.S. officials of providing no evidence to back their allegations, though the sanctions announcement made specific accusations on how money was transferred through the companies. It detailed how \u201cmules\u201d moved money through accounts in the U.S., as well as transactions carried out with Chinese companies that U.S. officials said provided materials to produce fentanyl.",
      "Mexico\u2019s banking authority has announced that it is temporarily taking over management of CIBanco and Intercam Banco to protect creditors.",
      "Sheinbaum said Tuesday that the Mexican government is doing everything within its power to ensure that creditors aren\u2019t affected, and said they were well \u201cwithin their right\u201d to pull their money from the banks.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department said that the sanctions would go into effect 21 days after the announcement.",
      "Fitch Ratings has downgraded the three institutions and other affiliates, citing \u201canti-money laundering concerns\u201d and saying the drop \u201creflects the imminent negative impact\u201d that the sanctions could have.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- A German court has suspended proceedings in the trial of former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn, who has been charged with fraud and market manipulation in connection with Volkswagen's use of rigged software that let millions of diesel-engine cars cheat on emissions tests.",
      "The regional court in Braunschweig on Tuesday cited an unspecified health issue that meant Winterkorn, 78, was not in a condition to face trial.",
      "The court said in a statement that it had \"provisionally terminated\u201d the proceedings. It said the health issue represented a \u201ctemporary impediment\u201d and would continue to be reviewed with the help of an expert so that proceedings could resume if Winterkorn recovers.",
      "Winterkorn went on trial in September, 2024 but the proceedings were suspended a few days later after Winterkorn had an accident.",
      "Germany's code of criminal procedure allows for a court to provisionally terminate proceedings \u201cif the absence of the indicted accused or some other personal impediment prevents the main hearing being held for a considerable time.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say Winterkorn knew about the illegal software well before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced its discovery of the violation in September 2015. He resigned days later. He has said he learned about the practice only shortly before the announcement and earlier testified during civil proceedings that the allegations against him \u201care not correct.\u201d",
      "In May, four former Volkswagen managers were convicted of fraud and two of them given prison sentences for their part in the manipulation of emissions controls.",
      "The former head of diesel development was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, and the head of drive train electronics to two years and seven months by the court in Braunschweig. Two others received suspended sentences of 15 months and 10 months.",
      "The company has paid more than $33 billion in fines and compensation to vehicle owners. Two VW managers received prison sentences in the U.S. The former head of the company\u2019s Audi division, Rupert Stadler, was given a suspended sentence of 21 months and a fine of 1.1 million euros ($1.25 million). The sentence is still subject to appeal.",

      "The mineral-rich Arctic island is open for tourism. Whale-watching tours, excursions to the iconic puffin island and guided charters through remote settlements are just the beginning of what Greenland has to offer visitors. Locals want to show what makes the island unique beyond a recent diplomatic dustup with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cOur goal and mission is to present and be the ambassadors of Greenland,\u201d said Casper Frank M\u00f8ller, the chief executive of Nuuk-based tour guide company Raw Arctic, \u201cand to show what beauty you can experience while you\u2019re here.\u201d",

      "Before the direct flight, air passengers departing from the U.S. needed a layover in Iceland or Denmark to reach Greenland. The change benefited travelers like Doug Jenzen, an American tourist who was on the United Airlines plane from New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI came with the purpose of exploring some of the natural sites around the world\u2019s largest island, hoping to support things like ecotourism and sustainable travel while supporting the local economy,\u201d Jenzen said.",
      "Cruise ships can already dock on the island but they bring less money to businesses catering to tourists because passengers sleep and usually eat on board.",
      "Some 150,000 tourists visited Greenland in 2024, according to Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's business minister.",
      "\u201cWe really want to grow the tourism sector. It\u2019s a very good fit for many in Greenland,\u201d Nathanielsen added. \u201cTourism is about good vibes. It\u2019s about sharing culture, sharing history. It\u2019s about storytelling. And as Inuit, that\u2019s very much part of our heritage.\u201d",
      "Greenland gained worldwide attention when Trump earlier this year announced he wanted to take control of the semiautonomous Danish territory, through a purchase or possibly by force.",
      "Denmark, a NATO ally, and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. gathering intelligence there.",
      "Despite the diplomatic tension, Frank M\u00f8ller of Raw Arctic sees an upside.",
      "\u201cIt has kind of put Greenland on the world map. And it\u2019s definitely a situation that Raw Arctic has used to our advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, beefing up the tourism industry should happen at a pace that prioritizes the voices and comfort levels of the roughly 56,000 people on the island, he added.",
      "Andreassen, of Nuuk Water Taxi, agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to tell my own story. Because I always feel like when I meet new people, I always introduce a whole Greenland,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to show our own culture, our own nature. Not by television, not by other people from other countries.\"",
      "In June, Pinar Saatci, a 59-year-old Turkish tourist, saw several whales breach the ocean surface during a boat tour.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be here, at the other part of the world, so far away from home,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting and unforgettable moment.\u201d",

      "The social media accounts for each city posted responses to Cunningham, who said Tuesday she wasn't sure \u201chow excited people are to be going to Detroit or (Cleveland).\u201d",
      "The X account for Cleveland posted a video of Fever star Caitlin Clark talking about having a good time in Cleveland during the 2024 Final Four in college, noting: \u201cSophie, your teammate doesn't seem to think Cleveland is too bad!\u201d",

      "The PGA Tour is changing how it pays $100 million in bonus money for the FedEx Cup",
      "The PGA Tour has done away with the staggered start for the FedEx Cup finale. In its place is a new pay structure with staggered bonuses to whoever is leading at three points in the final month of the season.",
      "The FedEx Cup champion will get $10 million, down from $25 million. However, if the No. 1 seed would still get $25 million if he stays at the top throughout the playoffs.",
      "The bonus pool remains at $100 million under the structure released Wednesday.",
      "But instead of the FedEx Cup champion receiving $25 million at the end of the Tour Championship, the No. 1 player will get $10 million after the regular season ends with the Wyndham Champion. Whoever leads the FedEx Cup after the BMW Championship gets $5 million. And the Tour Championship winner gets $10 million.",
      "This caps an overhaul to what the PGA Tour hopes can lead to a more compelling \u2014 and less confusing \u2014 end to the season.",
      "The staggered start \u2014 also known as starting strokes \u2014 gave the No. 1 seed a two-shot lead at the Tour Championship by putting him at 10-under par before the tournament event started.",
      "Now the top 30 who reach East Lake will start even, just like any tournament, and whoever wins the Tour Championship is the FedEx Cup champion.",
      "To account for the winner-take-all nature of the Tour Championship, the pay structure was altered to make sure season-long performances were still rewarded, and top players did not get penalized too much for having a bad week at East Lake.",
      "Scottie Scheffler was so dominant last year he led the FedEx Cup all through the playoffs, picking up the $25 million bonus as the champion.",
      "If the new payment structure had been in place in 2023, however, Jon Rahm would have received $10 million for leading the FedEx Cup going into the playoffs; Scheffler would have won $5 million for leading after the BMW Championship; and Viktor Hovland would have won $10 million for being the FedEx Cup champion.",
      "Rahm was the No. 1 seed starting the 2023 playoffs, tied for 18th in the Tour Championship and his postseason payout was $675,000. Under the new payment plan, Rahm would have received $12,208,750 for his FedEx Cup bonus \u2014 No. 1 going into the playoff, No. 4 after the BMW Championship and a tie for 21st in the Tour Championship.",
      "The Tour Championship effectively would have a $40 million purse, but the bonus money still will count as unofficial.",
      "The FedEx Cup points for the FedEx St. Jude Championship and the BMW Championship will remain quadruple the value to allow for movement in the standings.",
      "The Comcast Business Tour Top 10 is still around, a $40 million bonus pool for the regular season. So for this year, whoever leads the FedEx Cup going into the postseason would get $10 million from the FedEx Cup bonus and $8 million from Comcast.",

      "Gary Woodland will be going to his first Ryder Cup as an assistant captain for the American team",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- Former U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland will make his first Ryder Cup appearance this year, announced Wednesday as the fifth and final assistant to U.S. captain Keegan Bradley for the matches at Bethpage Black.",
      "Woodland joins Jim Furyk, Brandt Snedeker, Kevin Kisner and Webb Simpson as U.S. assistants when the Americans try to win back the cup from Europe on Sept. 26-28.",
      "The assistants could take on extra significance this year as Bradley decides whether to be the first playing captain since 1963. Bradley won the Travelers Championship two weeks ago, giving him more wins in the last year than any American except Scottie Scheffler.",
      "Two months remain before the six players qualify, followed by six captain's picks.",
      "\u201cAs a major champion and someone who is still competing at a high level, he is well aware of the demands of performing on golf\u2019s biggest stages,\u201d Bradley said of Woodland, who won the 2019 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. \"He will be a valuable leader for us over the coming months and throughout the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black.\u201d",
      "Woodland's lone experience in team matches was playing in the 2019 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne, going 1-1-1 in another U.S. victory. Tiger Woods was a playing captain that year.",
      "The Kansas native is favorite among players and a recent winner of the PGA Tour Courage award for having a lesion removed from his brain in September 2023 on a tract that caused unfounded fears.",
      "Woodland was runner-up in the Houston Open this year and is No. 68 in the FedEx Cup.",

      "Malik Beasley should be riding high right now, after a season where he became just the fifth player in NBA history to make at least 300 shots from 3-point range in a single season.",
      "Instead, his future seems very uncertain.",
      "He's a free agent and facing some serious off-court issues \u2014 including being part of an investigation surrounding what's believed to be unusual betting patterns on games and now some unrelated legal matters involving his personal finances.",
      "Beasley was a key part of the Detroit Pistons this past season, averaging 16.3 points per game for a team that made the playoffs and was one of the feel-good stories in the NBA \u2014 winning 44 games after winning only 14 in the previous season.",
      "Some questions and answers about Beasley's current situations and his future:",
      "Beasley has not been charged with any crime. Federal investigators, who have not commented publicly, are looking into betting patterns surrounding some games Beasley played in during the 2023-24 season when he was with the Milwaukee Bucks.",
      "The primary focus of the probe is what are called \u201cprop bets,\u201d ones where bettors can wager if a player will go over or under a certain statistical total \u2014 like will he score more than 10.5 points, grab 5.5 or more rebounds, that sort of thing.",
      "It is similar to other investigations \u2014 such as the one that led to the banning of then-Toronto player Jontay Porter from the league. Terry Rozier, who plays for the Miami Heat, was a subject of a similar probe surrounding part of his time with the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier was never charged and never faced any penalty from the NBA.",
      "ESPN reported that one game in question surrounded Beasley's performance on Jan. 31, 2024, and in particular whether he would get more or less than 2.5 rebounds. Bettors, ESPN was told, wagered large sums that he would not get that many rebounds. But Beasley got six rebounds that night, meaning those \u201cunder\u201d bets did not pay out.",
      "News of the gambling probe broke on Sunday, followed by news of lawsuits two days later \u2014 including one brought by a sports representation agency that is seeking more than $2 million in damages.",
      "That suit, brought by Hazan Sports Management Group, says Beasley breached his contract and failed to fully repay a $650,000 advance, among other issues. Beasley and that agency parted ways in recent months, even though it negotiated a $6 million contract for him to play with the Pistons this past season.",
      "\u201cI have been with Malik for a long time, I have seen a lot of people around him come and go, but I have stayed away from any of his financial management or mismanagement or decisions he would make with money,\u201d Beasley\u2019s criminal defense lawyer, Steve Haney, told The Detroit News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m his lawyer. I don\u2019t get involved in his finances,\u201d Haney told the newspaper. \u201cYou hope to get them around the best business people and planners and management people. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Other issues that were revealed were issues with rent payments, along with a settlement with a dentist and even a barber who works with a number of NBA players.",
      "The NBA has seen a huge spike in dependency on the 3-point shot in recent years, and Beasley \u2014 who made 319 of them this past season, one back of Minnesota's Anthony Edwards for the most in the league \u2014 is an elite 3-point shooter.",
      "Only two players have made more than 1,000 3s over the last four seasons. Golden State's Stephen Curry, the league's all-time 3-point king, is one. Beasley is the other.",
      "This means Beasley should be in high demand, given the fact that he has a skill all teams crave. And the Pistons, according to a person with knowledge of the talks, were prepared to offer Beasley a three-year contract to stay. But given the seriousness of the issues that have come up in recent days, those talks cooled.",
      "On Tuesday, Detroit struck a deal to bring in former Miami guard Duncan Robinson \u2014 another elite 3-point shooter \u2014 after striking a three-year deal.",
      "Beasley is a free agent, meaning he can sign with any team. Outside of the off-court concerns, here's another problem: Very few teams have the means available under the salary cap to give a new player a contract in the range of what Beasley would be worth, which is probably in the $15 million annually range.",
      "He may have to accept something much, much smaller \u2014 possibly even a minimum deal of about $3 million \u2014 to have a chance with a team next season.",

      "Aryna Sabalenka has come back after being two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home.",
      "Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Zheng Qinwen and No. 9 Paula Badosa. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players \u2014 10 women, 13 men \u2014 were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years.",
      "\u201cOf course you're going to know the overall picture. ... I hope it\u2019s no upsets anymore in this tournament,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said afterward with a chuckle. \"If you know what I mean.\u201d",
      "She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month \u2014 drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week \u2014 but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club.",
      "A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder.",
      "On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C).",
      "At Centre Court, the 48th-ranked Bouzkova went ahead 6-5 in the first set with the match's initial service break thanks to a double-fault by Sabalenka. Bouzkova served for that set, and was two points away from it at 30-15 in that game, again at 30-all, then once more at deuce.",
      "But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout.",
      "\u201cThat was a tough moment,\" said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. \u201cUntil that point, (my) return wasn\u2019t great enough to break her serve. I'm really glad ... everything clicked together and I was able to break her back. I kind of like felt a little bit better.\u201d",
      "That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that.",
      "Sabalenka compiled a 41-17 edge in winners while making only 18 unforced errors in a match that lasted a little more than 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men.",
      "Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 major championships at Wimbledon will lead off the Centre Court schedule on Day 4 against Britain's Dan Evans at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), followed by Iga Swiatek vs. Caty McNally, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. Aleksandar Vukic.",

      "Buffalo Bills first-round draft pick Maxwell Hairston faces a lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault in 2021",
      "BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills first-round draft pick Maxwell Hairston was accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting a woman in 2021 at the University of Kentucky.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Kentucky by a woman who claims Hairston entered her dorm room without being invited, ignored her when she said didn't want to have sexual intercourse, forcibly removed her bottoms and sexually assaulted her. The Associated Press does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.",
      "Texts seeking comment Wednesday were sent to agents for Hairston.",
      "The Bills had no comment and referred to statements made by general manager Brandon Beane in April during the draft. Beane said at the time the team had \u201cfully investigated\u201d a sexual assault allegation from 2021 involving Hairston, who he called \u201can impeccable kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s unfortunate when things like that are attached to someone\u2019s name. And in this case, doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there,\u201d Beane said.",
      "Hairston is from West Bloomfield, Michigan, and spent three seasons playing at Kentucky (2022-\u201924) before being selected by the Bills in the first round \u2014 30th overall \u2014 of the NFL draft in April. The 21-year-old Hairston is being given the opportunity to win a starting job at cornerback this season.",
      "The Bills have been off since completing their mandatory practices in mid-June, and return later this month for the start of training camp.",

      "The Lions are now two from two in five days in Australia after a 54-7 tour-opening win over Western Force in Perth on the weekend.",
      "On a cool, windy night in Brisbane, the Lions again took a while to get started, twice falling behind to early tries before turning a 12-7 deficit into a 21-12 halftime lead.",
      "Skipper Itoje, who was rested for the first game, ran powerfully onto an inside pass from scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park five minutes after the break to crack the game open, with the Lions scoring three tries in 15 minutes.",
      "The Lions were determined to play with pace and high-tempo, spreading the ball to the edges regularly and maintaining a positive attacking shape to generate space and scoring opportunities.",
      "\u201cAs a team we just wanted to be better today, take a step forward. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a step in the right direction,\u201d Itoje said of his first win as Lions captain. \"I think we were a little bit more clinical, sharper, a little bit more accurate on the ball.",

      "Flyhalf Finn Russell again orchestrated the Lions attack before he was rested after 55 minutes.",

      "Plans call for developers to build a pair of 200-meter (650-feet) towers and a smaller tower. The stadiums are to be rebuilt in the reconfigured space with the baseball stadium going where the rugby stadium now stands.",
      "The open letter is critical of so-called private finance schemes that give private developers access to park space. Hibiya Park is Tokyo's oldest public park, another example of this approach.",
      "Opposition to the Jingu redevelopment has included novelist Murakami, a conservancy group, and botanists and environmentalists who argue the sprawling project threatens 100-year-old gingko trees that grace the area's main avenue.",
      "A global conservancy body ICOMOS, which works with the United Nations body UNESCO, has said the development will lead to \u201cirreversible destruction of cultural heritage\u201d with trees and green space being lost.",
      "Opposition groups are pitted against powerful real-estate developer Mitsui Fudosan, the Shinto religious body, and Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that many Japanese citizens are not so much interested in democratically regulating their own city and are used to demolishing buildings,\u201d Kohei Saito, a Japanese political economist at Tokyo University, wrote to The Associated Press.",
      "He said \u201ccompanies with political power try to maximize their short-term profits without consideration of Tokyo's attractiveness (history, culture), inhabitants' well-being and future generations.\u201d",
      "Zoning changes to allow high-rise buildings in the area were made around 2013 by the Tokyo government when the city won the bid for the 2020 Olympics. Many of those changes permitted building the neighboring National Stadium but also applied to the park area.",
      "\u201cThe process of rezoning the area lacked transparency and democratic procedure and constitutes an illegal abuse of the governor\u2019s discretion in urban planning decisions,\u201d the open letter said.",
      "The Jingu district was considered \u201ccommon property\u201d until after World War II when the government sold it to Shinto under a promise it would remain a common space.",
      "The national government comes into play because the rugby venue is the property of the Japan Sport Council, a national government affiliated body. The rugby venue represents about 30% of the Jingu Gaien area.",
      "Opponents hope the timing later this month of a national election might aid their cause with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba heading a minority government.",
      "Former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has ties to the rugby venue.",
      "In addition to serving two decades ago as prime minister, he is the former president of the Japan Rugby Football Union and also served as the president of the 2020 Olympic organizing committee until he was forced to resign after making sexist comments about women.",
      "Opened in 1926, developers argue the baseball stadium is too old to save. However, Fenway Park in Boston dates from 1912 and Wrigley Field in Chicago from 1914. Both have been refurbished and are among the most venerated in the United States.",
      "Meiji Kinenkan, a historic reception hall in Jingu Gaien, dates from 1881 and is still widely used with no calls for its demolition. Mitsui Fudosan\u2019s headquarters building in Tokyo dates from 1929. Koshien Stadium, located near Osaka, was built in 1924 and has been in use since a refurbishment.",
      "The new rugby stadium would be an indoor venue with plastic grass, which players view as the least desirable surface for the sport.",

      "Nikolaj Ehlers could choose his destination as soon as Wednesday after letting the start of NHL free agency pass without signing a contract.",
      "Ehlers became one of the rare top players available not to sign on the first day of free agency, opting instead to sit back and consider his options. Carolina, Tampa Bay and Washington were considered among the teams interested in pursuing the 29-year-old from Denmark who played his first nine seasons with Winnipeg.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had talks with his agent,\" Hurricanes general manager Eric Tulsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking his time to field offers. He\u2019s obviously a very popular person right now, and we\u2019re waiting to see where that goes.\u201d",
      "Ehlers and his camp watched Tuesday as fellow winger Brock Boeser re-signed in Vancouver for just over $50 million and older forward Mikael Granlund got $7 million annually from Anaheim. With the salary cap increasing a record amount to $95.5 million and a lack of high-end talent available, Ehlers could sign the most lucrative contract among players changing teams this summer.",
      "Ehlers going unsigned is almost certainly holding things up for players like Anthony Beauvillier and Jeff Skinner, who could be part of a Plan B or C for those who don't land their first choice.

      "Defensemen Dmitry Orlov, Brent Burns and Matt Grzelcyk, forwards Jack Roslovic and Mason Appleton and goaltenders Ilya Samsonov and Alexandar Georgiev are also still available.",
      "\u201cDay 1 is always a little bit hectic and crazy,\u201d said San Jose GM Mike Grier, who made multiple moves but still needs to spend more to get to the salary floor. \u201cWe\u2019ll kind of see how things shake out. After (Tuesday night), things will settle down and teams will kind of regroup and see what\u2019s out there and the free agents will do the same.\u201d",

      "Shriners Children's operates 17 hospitals in the United States and one each in Mexico and Canada, plus clinics. The system is owned by Shriners International, a Masonic order. It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",

      "Georgia Tech owns the land adjoining its campus near downtown Atlanta, while the company built labs that opened last year. The development aims to emulate Georgia Tech's success in joint developments with technology companies in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood. That tech sector has been a major driver of growth in Atlanta in recent years, and officials are now trying to bolster growth from biomedical research.",
      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to really help embed some of their researchers here with Georgia Tech, to walk across campus, to work in the same labs, to have that physical presence together,\u201d West said. \u201cI think we can accomplish great things by doing that.\u201d",
      "The state and local governments are providing incentives to Shriners Children\u2019s, although it is not exactly clear how that would work because nonprofits are generally exempt from income and property taxes. In Georgia, nonprofit organizations do have to pay sales taxes, which means the state could waive such taxes on equipment purchases. Jessica Atwell, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said the state won\u2019t release documents until they are finalized.",

      "Ancient DNA has revealed links between the cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient DNA has revealed a genetic link between the cultures of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Researchers sequenced whole genomes from the teeth of a remarkably well-preserved skeleton found in a sealed funeral pot in an Egyptian tomb site dating to between 4,495 and 4,880 years ago.",
      "Four-fifths of the genome showed links to North Africa and the region around Egypt. But a fifth of the genome showed links to the area in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization flourished.",
      "\u201cThe finding is highly significant\" because it \u201cis the first direct evidence of what has been hinted at\u201d in prior work,\u201d said Daniel Antoine, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum.",
      "Earlier archeological evidence has shown trade links between Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as similarities in pottery-making techniques and pictorial writing systems. While resemblances in dental structures suggested possible ancestral links, the new study clarifies the genetic ties.",
      "The Nile River is \u201clikely to have acted as an ancient superhighway, facilitating the movement of not only cultures and ideas, but people,\u201d said Antoine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeleton was found in an Egyptian tomb complex at the archaeological site of Nuwayrat, inside a chamber carved out from a rocky hillside. An analysis of wear and tear on the skeleton \u2014 and the presence of arthritis in specific joints \u2014 indicates the man was likely in his 60s and may have worked as a potter, said co-author and bioarchaeologist Joel Irish of Liverpool John Moores University.",
      "The man lived just before or near the start of ancient Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified as one state, leading to a period of relative political stability and cultural innovation \u2014 including the construction of the Giza pyramids.",
      "\u201cThis is the time that centralized power allowed the formation of ancient Egypt as we know it,\u201d said co-author Linus Girdland-Flink, a paleogeneticist at the University of Aberdeen.",
      "At approximately the same time, Sumerian city-states took root in Mesopotamia and cuneiform emerged as a writing system.",

      "Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months compared to a year earlier as boycotts over Elon Musk\u2019s political views continue to keep buyers away",
      "NEW YORK -- Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away.",
      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",
      "\u201cThe numbers weren\u2019t as bad as thought with all the analyst forecast cuts we saw over the past week,\u201d said Morningstar's Seth Goldstein, though he added the report overall showed the company faces big challenges. \u201cThe current product lineup is at market saturation and Tesla will need the new affordable vehicle to grow deliveries.\u201d",
      "Musk has promised a cheaper EV model would be coming this year that would boost sales.",
      "It's not clear yet if Musk's latest feud with Trump will help lure back buyers who have been angry at the billionaire's political positions. After Musk once again took to social media to criticize Trump's budget bill, the president threatened Tuesday to use the power of his office to hurt his companies, including Tesla, pushing its stock down more than 5%.",
      "A June AP-NORC poll showed about half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans.",
      "The new figures come as Tesla is focusing less on new models and more on robots, self-driving technology and robotaxis ferrying passengers around without anyone behind the wheel.",
      "Tesla is in the midst of a test run of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, that seems to have gone smoothly for the most part. But it also has drawn the scrutiny of federal car safety regulators because of a few mishaps, including one case in which a Tesla cab was shown on a video heading down an opposing lane.",
      "The competition from rival EV makers is especially fierce in Europe where China's BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. Tesla sales fell 28% in May in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla's best selling Model Y. That new version has been out for months now.",
      "Tesla reports second quarter financial results on July 23. In the first quarter, net income fell 71%.",

      "BANGKOK -- A U.S. judge has ruled that China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei\u2019s request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there.",
      "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks.",
      "In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.",
      "Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.",
      "Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of \u201ceconomic bullying\u201d and of improperly using national security as a pretext for \u201coppressing Chinese companies.\u201d In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were \u201dimpermissibly extraterritorial,\" and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud.",
      "The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies.",
      "The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.",

      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A proposal to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade was soundly defeated in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, thwarting attempts to insert the measure into President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts.",
      "The Senate voted 99-1 to strike the AI provision from the legislation after weeks of criticism from both Republican and Democratic governors and state officials.",
      "Originally proposed as a 10-year ban on states doing anything to regulate AI, lawmakers later tied it to federal funding so that only states that backed off on AI regulations would be able to get subsidies for broadband internet or AI infrastructure.",
      "A last-ditch Republican effort to save the provision would have reduced the time frame to five years and sought to exempt some favored AI laws, such as those protecting children or country music performers from harmful AI tools.",
      "But that effort was abandoned when Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal. Voting on the amendment happened after 4 a.m. Tuesday as part of an overnight session as Republican leaders sought to secure support for the tax cut bill while fending off other proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.",
      "Proponents of an AI moratorium had argued that a patchwork of state and local AI laws is hindering progress in the AI industry and the ability of U.S. firms to compete with China.",
      "Some prominent tech leaders welcomed the idea after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who leads the Senate Commerce committee, floated it at a hearing in May.",
      "But state and local lawmakers and AI safety advocates argued that the rule is a gift to an industry that wants to avoid accountability for its products. Led by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a majority of GOP governors sent a letter to Congress opposing it.",
      "Also appealing to lawmakers to strike the provision was a group of parents of children who have died as a result of online harms.",

      "A federal judge has allowed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed, rejecting the company's request to dismiss the case",
      "A federal judge on Monday rebuffed Apple's request to throw out a U.S. government lawsuit alleging the technology trendsetter has built a maze of illegal barriers to protect the iPhone from competition and fatten its profit margins.",
      "The 33\u2014page opinion from U.S. District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027.",
      "Apple has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the Justice Department had distorted the contours of the smartphone market and made a series of other misinterpretations that warranted the case be thrown out.",
      "But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial.",
      "The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation.",
      "The lawsuit \u201csets forth several allegations of technological barricades that constitute anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Neals wrote in his opinion. The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \u201cdangerous possibility\u201d that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly.",
      "In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court.\u201d",
      "The antitrust lawsuit isn't the only legal headache threatening to undercut its profits, which totaled $94 billion on sales of $295 billion in its fiscal year ending last September.",
      "Another federal judge in April issued a civil contempt order banning Apple from collecting any fees from in-app transactions on the iPhone that are funneled through other options besides its once-exclusive payment processing system that charged commissions ranging from 15% to 30%.",
      "Apple also could lose a more than $20 billion annual payment that it gets for making Google the default search tool on the iPhone and other products as part of another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department. A federal judge in Washington D.C. is considering whether to ban the deals with Apple as part of a shake-up being proposed to address Google's illegal monopoly in searc h.",
      "Neals' decision to allow the Justice Department's antitrust case to proceed came on the same day that Apple was hit with a lawsuit by app maker Proton amplifying the accusations of wrongful conduct by the company. The lawsuit, which will seek to be certified as a class action presenting thousands of developers who have made iPhone apps, is asking for punitive damages against Apple, as well as a court order to dismantle its walled garden.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place.

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

Combs has said that all of the sex was consensual and that while his relationships sometimes involved domestic violence, he wasn't engaged in trafficking.",
      "Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said Combs was simply part of the swinger lifestyle and that he \"vehemently denies the accusations made by the SDNY.\"",

      "Following comments from Sean Combs' large defense team, attorney Marc Agnifilo said they will not be talking about the bail decision because it's still a \"pending, unresolved matter.\"",
      "\"The one thing I'm going to leave with this we are not nearly done fighting. We are just getting started,\" he said. \"To win this and to defeat the prosecutors from the Southern District of New York takes effort from beginning to end.\"",
      "\"Today was a major, major step in the right direction. But we fight on and we're going to win and we're not going to stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family,\" he continued.",

      "Agnifilo said the jury was \"wonderful.\"",
      "\"They listened to every word, and they got the situation right, or certainly right enough,\" he said. \"They acquitted him of the sex trafficking, which he was absolutely innocent of. They acquitted him of the racketeering conspiracy that he was absolutely innocent of.\"",
      "Judge agrees to move up sentencing date",
      "After defense attorneys asked for a more expedited sentencing, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian agreed to move up the sentencing date from October. He did not set a new date for the sentencing itself.",

    "summary": "Lawsuit accuses Trump administration of 'systemic pattern' of targeting minorities in immigration crackdown",
    "story": [
      "The Los Angeles raids began last month and resulted in protests across the city.",
      "A lawsuit was filed against President Donald Trump's administration claiming masked agents have been targeting \"individuals with brown skin\" in Southern California, arresting them without probable cause and keeping them in \"dungeon-like\" conditions in efforts to deport them.",
      "The claim, filed in the Central District of California on Wednesday, attempts to block the administration's \"ongoing pattern and practice of flouting the Constitution and federal law.\" The lawsuit looks to stop \"indiscriminate immigration operations flooding street corners, bus stops, parking lots, agricultural sites, day laborer corners, and other places...\"",
      "\"Since June 6th, marauding, masked goons have descended upon Los Angeles, terrorizing our brown communities and tearing up the Constitution in the process,\" Mohammad Tajsar, ACLU Southern California attorney who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement.",
      "\"No matter their status or the color of their skin, everyone is guaranteed Constitutional rights to protect them from illegal stops. We will hold DHS accountable.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News in a statement that allegations claiming law enforcement have targeted individuals because of their skin color are not true.",
      "\"Any claims that individuals have been 'targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,\" McLaughlin said. \"These type of smears are designed to demonize and villainize our brave ICE law enforcement.\"",
      "A major complaint in the lawsuit alleges that detainees are being kept in substandard confinement facilities that are detrimental to their overall health.",
      "\"Members of the Southern California community have been whisked away and disappeared into a grossly overcrowded dungeon-like facility lacking food, medical care, basic hygiene, and beds,\" Mark Rosenbaum, a Public Counsel attorney who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The objective of this draconian crackdown is to eviscerate basic rights to due process and to shield from public view the horrifying ways ICE and Border Patrol agents treat citizens and residents who have been stigmatized by our government as violent criminals based on skin color alone.\"",
      "McLaughlin told ABC News on Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers have higher standards than most United States prisons and those in detention are receiving adequate meals and health care.",
      "\"All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members,\" McLaughlin said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\"This includes medical, dental, and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.\"",
      "The Southern California raids have led to the detention of more than 1,500 people, according to the plaintiffs' attorneys. They claim that federal agents consistently refuse to identify themselves or what agency they are with when asked, using anonymity as a tactic to shield alleged lawlessness.",
      "\"In these interactions, agents typically have no prior information about the individual and no warrant of any kind,\" according to the lawsuit. \"If agents make an arrest, contrary to federal law, they do not make any determination of whether a person poses a risk of flight before a warrant can be obtained. Also contrary to federal law, the agents do not identify themselves or explain why the individual is being arrested.\"",

The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "The majority leader added, \"When you talk to members, there's some that still are holding out for something different, but at the end of the day, they know this is probably as good as we're going to get.\"",
      "Scalise said that Republican leadership is meeting with small groups of members who haven't locked in their support, and the president is also helping on that today as their \"best closer.\"",

      "In a 128-page order, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrote that President Donald Trump cannot \"adopt an alternative immigration system,\" saying that Trump has exceeded his legal authority as president.",

      "A key test vote is expected in the House on Wednesday, but it's unclear if it will pass given divisions within the GOP. Several House Republicans were spotted at the White House to meet with President Trump, who is ramping up pressure on lawmakers to get the bill to his desk.",
      "But several changes made by the Senate to the bill passed by the House back in May could become sticking points.",
      "Medicaid provisions",
      "The Senate made even deeper cuts and other changes to Medicaid, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating 11.8 million Americans could lose their health insurance over the next decade as a result. That's roughly three million more people than the CBO estimate for the House bill.",
      "The Senate kept many of the new work requirements for Medicaid that the House approved, but significantly altered the Medicaid provider tax that states use to secure more federal funding for the health program.",
      "That became a point of contention among some Senate Republicans, including North Carolina's Thom Tillis and Maine's Susan Collins, who both voted against the Senate bill.",
      "Already, some House Republicans have voiced similar concern.",
      "Rep. David Valadao, a moderate California Republican, said he would vote no on the Trump bill unless the Senate stuck to the exact Medicaid provisions in the House-passed bill.",
      "\"I support the reasonable provisions in H.R. 1 that protect Medicaid's long-term viability and ensure the program continues to serve our most vulnerable, but I will not support a final bill that eliminates vital funding streams our hospitals rely on, including provider taxes and state directed payments, or any provisions that punish expansion states,\" Valadao said in a statement.",
      "Deficit and debt limit",
      "The CBO estimated the Senate bill would add roughly $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years -- about $1 trillion more than the version passed by the House.",
      "The Senate version also includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, significantly higher than the $4 trillion hike approved by the lower chamber.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, on Tuesday said the \"overall deficit number is not good\" and that he was not \"inclined\" to support the Senate bill.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, said the House should take more time to work through the Senate bill and find a compromise.",
      "\"The Senate bill moved way far away from the House bill, added $750 billion to an already large deficit and debt,\" Harris said on CNBC on Wednesday morning, adding that contributing more to the deficit is \"probably not a good idea.\"",
      "Other changes",
      "Other Republican hardliners are taking issue with various portions of the House bill that were taken out by the Senate parliamentarian, who is responsible for ensuring provisions abide by the Byrd Rule and reconciliation process.",
      "Some of the items taken out of the House bill include language that would have repealed some Biden-era rules on clean energy and electric vehicles.",
      "The Senate version of the bill also phases out solar energy tax credits that were part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act at a slower rate than the House version.",
      "\"Many Senators thought they were voting for a bill that would end the Green New Scam,\" Rep. Keith Self, a Texas Republican, wrote on X. \"Turns out, a last-minute paragraph inserted by lobbyists and agreed to by leadership does the exact opposite. What else is lurking in this bill? And why is the House being pressured to vote on it with less than 24 hours to review?\"",
      "Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, said he wanted to push an amendment to replace the Senate text with the House bill.",
      "\"I don\u2019t work for the Senate parliamentarian. I work for the PEOPLE. That\u2019s why I just filed an amendment to delete their dud and replace it with the strong House bill we passed weeks ago,\" Ogles wrote on X. \"The Senate\u2019s version of the Big Beautiful Bill guts key Trump provisions -- all at the behest of an unelected parliamentarian.\"",
      "A big hurdle for House Republicans when they first took up Trump's domestic policy bill was SALT, the State and Local Tax deduction.",
      "The House ultimately decided on a $40,000 cap and $500,000 income limit would increase by 1 percent through 2033. The Senate version, however, would keep the cap on state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for married couple who make less than $500,000 per year, but the cap drops down to $10,000 after five years in 2029.",

      "The assessment from Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, appeared to be significantly more optimistic than by U.N. inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency. IAEA's director general Rafael Grossi said last weekend that he believed Iran could begin enriching uranium in a matter of months.",

      "When asked what the latest intelligence might show, Parnell told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that the administration's stance is unchanged that Iran's nuclear sites were \"completely obliterated.\" The term \"obliterated\" was first used by President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the hours after the bombing.",
      "\"It's delayed by one to two years. I think we're thinking probably closer to two years,\" Parnell told reporters.",
      "He added that the U.S. strike took a psychological toll because it relied on bombers that were capable of flying nonstop for nearly 37 hours, in addition to destroying the physical sites Iran was using the produce enriched uranium.",
      "\"It's not just ... enriched uranium or centrifuges or things like that. We destroyed the components that they would need to build a bomb,\" he said.",
      "\"And so when you take that constellation of things into consideration, yeah, we believe that Iran's nuclear capability has been severely degraded. It's even their ambition to build a bomb,\" he added.",

      "The disclosure of the DIA findings, first reported by CNN, enraged Trump who said the pilots were \"devastated.\"",
      "\"You know, I got a call from Missouri -- great state that I won three times by a lot,\" Trump said. \"And I got a call that the pilots and the people on the plane were devastated because they [the press] were trying to minimize the attack ... I spoke to one of them [who] said, 'sir, we hit the site. It was perfect. It was dead on.\"",
      "\"Because they don't understand fake news, because they have a normal life except they have to fly very big, very fast planes. But it's a shame. You should be making them heroes,\" Trump said.",

      "Absentees could be a problem for Republicans after storms snarled travel.",
      "The House is debating ahead of a key test vote for President Donald Trump's tax and immigration megabill to send it to the floor for a final vote but it was unclear Wednesday morning if Speaker Mike Johnson has the votes to get it passed.",
      "Johnson faces opposition from factions within his caucus, particularly among fiscal hawks, that puts passage in question. In addition to that, storms Tuesday snarled travel to Washington. In an earlier procedural vote Wednesday, eight Republicans were absent.",
      "With a razor-thin majority, Johnson can afford only three defections if all members are voting and present.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise cast some doubt that Republicans will succeed today, questioning aloud whether the House will pass the president\u2019s bill on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe'll see some time later today if we can get that done,\u201d Scalise told reporters. \u201cSo we still have some more conversations with members. Obviously, members have gone through the changes that the Senate made, and you know, some of them take us a little bit backwards. Some of them are a little bit better.\u201d",
      "The House must first pass a rule, which is a procedural motion to advance legislation, to consider final passage of the bill. It is unclear if that will pass.",
      "The House took up the bill Tuesday night after a nail-biter vote in the Senate with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaker vote after it split 50-50. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis, Rand Paul and Susan Collins voted against the measure, along with every Democrat.",
      "The legislation passed the House Rules Committee early on Wednesday with a 7-6 vote.",
      "Republican backers of the Senate bill have touted its roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts and new funding for border security, plus the inclusion of key Trump campaign pledges such as no taxes on tips and overtime.",
      "The legislation also guts Biden-era clean energy initiatives; slashes entitlement health programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which are intended to help the nation's most vulnerable Americans; and includes a plan to lift the cap on the state and local tax deduction, currently set at $10,000, to $40,000.",
      "The Senate version is projected to add roughly $1 trillion more -- and $3.3 trillion in total -- to the deficit over the next decade when compared with the version passed by the House in May, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO also found that 11.8 million people could go uninsured over the next decade due to cuts in Medicaid, which emerged as a critical issue among several of the Senate Republican holdouts.",
      "Johnson said Tuesday evening that some members were facing problems getting back to Washington, D.C., after more than 1,200 flights were canceled or delayed across the country because of storms in the eastern U.S.",
      "Nonetheless, Johnson told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Tuesday night that he expects a vote in the House on Wednesday or Thursday.",
      "\"Assuming we have a full House, we'll get it through the Rules Committee in the morning,\" he said. \"We'll move that forward to the floor, and hopefully we're voting on this by tomorrow or Thursday at latest, depending on the weather and delays and travel and all the rest.\"",
      "Johnson and top Republican leaders said in a statement that the House will consider the bill \"immediately for final passage\" -- with renewed intent to put the measure on Trump's desk by July 4.",
      "\"The American people gave us a clear mandate, and after four years of Democrat failure, we intend to deliver without delay,\" the leaders said.",
      "\"This bill is President Trump's agenda, and we are making it law. House Republicans are ready to finish the job,\" they added.",
      "Trump told ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce on Tuesday that he expects the bill \"to go very nicely\" in the House.",
      "Asked about the House Republicans who were unhappy with the Senate's version of the legislation, the president said, \"Well, I just heard that about the Senate, and the bill just passed, and it tells you there's something for everyone.\"",
      "\"I mean, we have -- it's a great bill,\" he continued. \"There is something for everyone, and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House. Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "Trump disputed the CBO's projection that the bill would cause 11.8 million Americans to lose their insurance.",
      "\"I'm saying it's going to be a very much smaller number than that and that number will be waste, fraud and abuse,\" he said, though did not say where he was getting such data or analysis from.",
      "Several House Republicans were at the White House Wednesday morning for meetings as Trump ramped up pressure on his party to pass the bill. Vance arriving as well.",
      "An administration official said the White House is holding multiple meetings on the White House complex with Republicans. The president is expected to engage directly with members throughout the day.",
      "Some of the lawmakers spotted entering the White House included Reps. Jeff Van Drew, Rob Bresnahan, Dusty Johnson, Dan Newhouse, Mike Lawler, Andrew Garbarino. Those lawmakers are part of the Main Street Caucus -- a group of lawmakers who bill themselves as \"pragmatic\" conservatives focused on getting things done.",
      "Vance was also spotted arriving at the White House.",
      "The House process began Tuesday with a meeting of the Rules Committee, which approved the bill by 7-6 after almost 12 hours of discussion. GOP Reps. Ralph Norman and Chip Roy sided with Democrats in voting against the measure in committee.",
      "Roy was among the early critics of the bill, saying he was \"not inclined to vote\" for the legislation as amended. Roy has previously threatened to withhold support on critical votes, only to ultimately side with the president.",
      "Roy said \"the overall deficit number is not good\" in the bill the Senate passed, suggesting it violates the House's budget framework. \"It's front-loaded versus back-loaded, as we all know. I think it got worse. I think SALT got worse. It got more expensive,\" he added.",
      "After Tuesday's Senate vote, Majority Leader John Thune said he and his colleagues had delivered a \"strong product\" to the House, but also acknowledged there may be more hurdles before the legislation reaches Trump's desk.",
      "\"Well, we'll see,\" Thune said when asked about the bill's chances. \"I mean, you know how hard it was to pass it -- I think the House, I appreciate the narrow margins they have over there.\"",
      "\"I think we took what they sent us and strengthened and improved upon it,\" he added. \"And so I'm hopeful that now, when it gets sent over there, as they deliberate about how they want to handle it, they'll find the goals that are necessary to pass it.\"",

      "LONDON -- The White House confirmed on Tuesday that President Donald Trump's administration froze the shipment of some air defense and precision guided weapons that were on track to be sent to Ukraine.",
      "Officials said the decision followed an assessment of U.S. stockpiles.",
      "\"This decision was made to put America's interests first following a DOD review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,\" said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly.",
      "\"The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned -- just ask Iran,\" she added in a statement sent to reporters.",
      "Politico first reported the decision. It was not immediately clear whether other shipments of weapons would be released or how much was paused.",
      "The Pentagon declined to provide additional details about the decision.",
      "\"America's military has never been more ready and more capable thanks to President Trump and Secretary Hegseth's leadership,\" Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "\"Our service members are fully equipped to deter against any threat and the Senate's recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill ensures that our weapons and defense systems are modernized to protect against 21st century threats for generations to come.\"",
      "Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby provided an updated statement Wednesday saying the military is continuing to provide Trump \"with robust options to continue military aid to Ukraine, consistent with his goal of bringing this tragic war to an end.\"",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak -- a top adviser to Ukraine's presidential office -- denied that the U.S. will end its supply air defenses to Ukraine. Speaking on Ukrainian television on Wednesday, Podolyak said negotiations are ongoing on how to provide them, including potential purchases by Kyiv.",
      "\"America will not abandon its support for Ukraine in protecting civilians from Russian strikes,\" Podolyak said. \"There are enough anti-missile systems and missiles for them in U.S. warehouses.\"",
      "\"Negotiations on their supply to Ukraine, including on a commercial basis, are ongoing,\" Podolyak said.",
      "Ukraine's Defense Ministry also commented on the reports, saying in a post to Telegram it \"has not received any official notification regarding the suspension or revision of delivery schedules for the agreed defense assistance.\" The ministry said it requested a phone call with its U.S. counterparts \"to further clarify the details.\"",
      "\"For Ukraine, it is critically important to maintain resilience, continuity, and predictability in the provision of the agreed defense assistance -- especially in strengthening our air defense systems,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"We are grateful to the United States for all its support and highly value the efforts of our American partners aimed at achieving genuine peace. We emphasize that the path to ending the war lies through consistent and collective pressure on the aggressor, as well as through continued support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News that the reports are \"concerning, of course, but I hope that it\u2019s some kind of technical delay.\"",
      "\"If not, then it might have negative impact on our defense capabilities -- especially when it comes to air defense,\" Merezhko added. Any hint of a delay in aid, the lawmaker warned, would \"embolden\" Russian President Vladimir Putin \"to intensify bombardments.\"",
      "The military shipment was frozen comes just a week after Trump signaled his openness to selling Patriot missiles to Ukraine.",
      "After meeting with Zelenskyy at the NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump said, \"They do want to have the anti-missile, missiles,\" Trump said of Ukraine. \"As they call them the Patriots, and we're going to see if we can make some available.\"",
      "\"You know, they're very hard to get. We need them too. We were supplying them to Israel, and they're very effective, 100% effective. Hard to believe how effective,\" Trump said.",
      "\"As far as money going, we'll see what happens. There's a lot of spirit,\" Trump added.",
      "The Patriot system is especially valuable to Ukraine, having been used to down Russian ballistic missiles, drones and aircraft since arriving in the country in the spring of 2023.",
      "Russia is intensifying its near-nightly drone and missile attacks on cities and targets all across Ukraine.",
      "June saw Moscow set a new monthly record for the number of long-range drones and missiles launched into Ukraine -- 5,438 drones and 239 missiles -- according to figures published by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "The U.S. remained the most generous single contributor of aid to Ukraine as of April 2025, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a research group based in Germany that tracks support from foreign governments toward Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. has contributed around $130 billion in total aid to Ukraine since 2022, of which $74 billion is military assistance. Combined, European Union nations have contributed more overall -- $157 billion -- but less than the U.S. on the military front, at slightly less than $73 billion.",
      "Ukraine's budget for military and security spending approved by lawmakers in late 2024 was around $53.7 billion.",
      "Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of curtailing or ending U.S. military support for Kyiv, both on the campaign trail and since returning to office in January. A nine-month pause on U.S. aid in 2024, due to a gridlocked Congress, forced Kyiv to consider a future without American assistance.",
      "Those fears materialized in March 2025 when Trump imposed a week-long freeze on all American military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The flow soon resumed, but Trump's frustration has only deepened as U.S.-brokered peace talks floundered.",
      "The administration approved a $50 million sale of military aid to Ukraine in April, but only after Kyiv signed off on a controversial minerals sharing deal.",
      "The White House is also yet to use some $3.9 billion earmarked to fund military aid to Ukraine -- to be drawn from existing U.S. stocks, meaning it can be delivered quickly -- that former President Joe Biden was not able to spend before the end of his term.",
      "Zelenskyy said early this year that American aid accounts for 30% of Ukrainian weaponry. Though other estimates go as low as 20%, Washington remains a key benefactor -- particularly for advanced weapons systems for which Ukraine has no domestically- or European-produced analogues.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration is pausing over $6 billion of congressionally-appropriated federal funding for after-school, student support, teacher training, English language and other education programs, according to a Department of Education memo obtained by ABC News.",
      "In a letter to Congress from the agency's office of legislation and congressional affairs Monday afternoon, the DOE said a notification would be sent to certain grantees alerting them that funding for the upcoming school year would be reviewed on July 1 and decisions concerning this academic year have \"not yet been made.\"",
      "\"The department will not be issuing grant award notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review,\" the memo reads in part. \"The department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president's priorities and the department's statutory responsibilities.\"",
      "The statutorily mandated special education funding through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) have been awarded to states on time, according to a DOE source.",
      "But school budgets for the year are typically approved in May or June and are ready to be allocated by July 1, according to education finance experts. The abrupt messaging from the administration gave scant details on how the key programs would be impacted moving forward and comes just weeks before many state education agencies return students to the classroom.",
      "The 2024 National Teacher of the Year Missy Testerman, an English as a Second Language (ESL) instructor in Tennessee, told ABC News any withholding of funds will affect schools.",
      "\"School budgets are already very tight, so withholding funds for required programs -- such as those for English learners -- will certainly place a burden on school systems,\" Testerman wrote in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"This likely will mean that systems will face the difficult decision to make budget cuts in other areas, affecting students. In rural systems like mine, this could mean a reduction in overall staff or the elimination of crucial supports for students such as afterschool and tutoring programs,\" Testerman added.",
      "House Education and Workforce Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., called the move to withhold the appropriated funds a violation of federal law with potentially devastating consequences.",
      "\"The halting of these critical funds harms the students, educators, and schools that strive to provide quality public education with the meager funds and challenges they face,\" Scott wrote in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"Cash-strapped school districts, particularly those in low-income and rural areas, cannot afford this delay and will likely be forced to either lay off staff or cut back on programs and services while the White House Office of Budget and Management 'reviews' the funding,\" Scott said.",
      "State attorneys general are expected to sue the administration over the reviews, according to a source familiar with the matter. Parents groups and education advocates decrying the decision are also mounting lawsuits against the administration, the source confirmed. Advocates accuse the administration of undermining public education in a \"cruel betrayal\" of students.",
      "\"Schools are already grappling with severe teacher shortages, burnout and under-resourced classrooms, and here comes the federal government ripping resources away from public schools. It is outrageous and unconscionable,\" said National Education Association President Becky Pringle.",
      "\"Educators and parents will not be silent while students are undervalued, unheard and unsupported,\" Pringle wrote in a statement, adding, \"We will stand up, speak out and take action to ensure every classroom is a place of dignity, opportunity and respect.\"",
      "Education providers are sounding the alarm about the funding that impacts millions of students, teachers, and families, telling ABC News they fear that low-income students and families will be left in a bind with no other options of care for their children.",
      "The Afterschool Alliance, a nonprofit organization, said, \"If these funds are not released very soon, we will quickly see more children and youth unsupervised and at risk, more academic failures, more hungry kids, more chronic absenteeism, higher dropout rates, more parents forced out of their jobs, and a less STEM-ready and successful workforce as our child care crisis worsens dramatically.\"",
      "The pause comes as efforts to dismantle the Department of Education have been blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court is also expected to weigh in on the firing of nearly 2,000 employees at the agency.",
      "The DOE referred additional questions to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).",
      "An OMB spokesman told ABC News the pause is due to an \"ongoing programmatic review\" of education funding, adding no decisions have been made yet.",

      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them.

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",
      "A spokesman for the administration said Prasad \u201chas raised serious concerns\u201d about the issue.",
      "\u201cWe will not ignore these risks and will ensure that the gold standard of science is used for any decisions,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, in an emailed statement.",
      "Outside researchers have noted that cases of the heart condition tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",

      "A veteran who died in Chicago without any recollection of their life has been memorialized in a funeral service with military honors",
      "CHICAGO -- Standing near the gravestone for the relative he never met, Mark Bailey accepted the crisply folded American flag from the Army officer, hugged it to his chest and closed his eyes.",
      "Though the person he called his aunt \u2014 born Reba Caroline Bailey \u2014 had been estranged, missing for decades and died in 2015 as an unidentified ward of the state, he felt connection and a sense of closure.",
      "\u201cI want to let Reba know we\u2019re part of the circle and part of the family,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark Bailey was among dozens of attendees at an unusual funeral service with military honors this week for an Illinois veteran with memory problems so severe that they died an unnamed person. The ceremony became possible because of an extraordinary cold case investigation that identified the 75-year-old postmortem.",
      "Investigators unearthed the mystery of how the Women\u2019s Army Corps veteran ended up homeless in Chicago with few recollections of their own life, aside from identifying as a man named Seven.",
      "\u201cI never knew I had this family member,\u201d said Mark Bailey\u2019s 19-year-old son Cole, who also drove from central Illinois for the service. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I have somebody that\u2019s been found and isn\u2019t lost anymore.\u201d",
      "Since the investigation\u2019s conclusion, the numbered cement cylinder that marked the unidentified grave has been replaced with a rectangular plague with a cross that reads: \u201cReba Caroline Bailey, PFC US Army.\u201d",
      "The case of Seven Doe, the name appearing in some official records, came to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart\u2019s office in 2023. The unidentified body belonged to a person who died of natural causes in an assisted living facility. They were a ward of the state, unable to remember a legal name or family.",
      "The cause of death was heart disease with diabetes and dementia as contributing factors and the body was buried in a section for unclaimed people at Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery on Chicago's Far South Side. The medical examiner marked it as the 4,985th case of the year and put the number on the headstone.",
      "In 2023, investigators ran fingerprints taken postmortem and found a 1961 Army record for the veteran, formerly of Danville, about 140 miles (225.31 kilometers) south of Chicago. The search for close living relatives came up short; five siblings and an ex-husband had all died.",
      "The family members they did locate had only heard stories of a relative who had disappeared. After making the identification, detectives ordered a new headstone with the same name on military records. It was quietly installed last year.",
      "Commander Jason Moran, who oversees the sheriff\u2019s missing persons unit, said it was rewarding to make sure the identified veteran got the benefit of a funeral with military honors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a privilege to be able to help families and really close the story,\u201d said Moran, whose work on other high-profile cold cases has gained notoriety.",
      "Several generations of the Bailey family have told stories about what happened to their missing relative since leaving the military to get married.",
      "They've wondered about the possibility of children or their relative's gender identity. Some believe that there was a family dispute but the stories about its origins vary from the decision to join the military to sexual orientation.",
      "Family members tried to find their missing relative over the years, including Amanda Ingram, who would have been a great-niece. She maintains a meticulous family tree with Census records and photos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how somebody can just disappear like that and not know what happened,\u201d Ingram said this week. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re never going to know the details.\u201d",
      "On a winter day in the late 1970s, a person wearing a military-style jacket and aviator cap was curled up on the porch of St. Francis Catholic Worker House in Chicago. Residents who stayed there at the time told the Associated Press that the person asked to be called Seven, spoke in the third person and identified as a man.",
      "Seven quickly became the house cook. The meals drew crowds to the neighborhood where several homeless advocacy groups operated, according to former residents' accounts.",
      "Investigators have tried to explain the memory loss and floated theories about brain damage related to a 1950 car accident that killed Bailey's mother or to military service. That included stints at Fort Ord in California, a polluted former Army base, and Fort McClellan in Alabama, formerly used for chemical weapons training, and where the federal government has acknowledged potential exposure to toxins.",
      "Neither family, investigators nor residents of the worker house figured out the meaning behind the name Seven.",
      "Ingram, who lives in Alabama, couldn\u2019t make the ceremony this week. But she asked volunteers from an Illinois chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution to attend on her behalf.",
      "\u201cEverybody who comes to visit that cemetery will pass by it and know who she was,\u201d said Ingram, whose detailed family trees include records using Bailey's birth name.",
      "Mark Bailey said he and his son wanted to bring something to the service that would honor both parts of their long-lost relative's life.",
      "They had heard their relative had an affinity for the Cubs and looked for a jersey with the number \u201c7\u201d on it, but settled on a blue team cap. They set it on the headstone.",
      "The service held Tuesday included prayers, a 21-gun salute and a bugler playing taps \u2014 a chilling, 24-note salute that is traditionally played at funerals of U.S. military veterans. Attendees included Cook County sheriff's investigators and Archdiocese of Chicago staff.",
      "\u201cI just wish the rest of them could be identified as well,\u201d Mark Bailey told those attending while pointing to the rows of unidentified graves.",
      "Dart, the Cook County sheriff, said the ceremony left him nearly speechless, saying the Illinois veteran deserved military honors and a flag from the U.S. president \u201cinstead of being forgotten and left as an anonymous number somewhere.\u201d",
      "Relatives said they planned to eventually display the flag at the American Legion in Potomac, near where the Bailey family has roots.",
      "Mark Bailey said the acknowledgement of military service was particularly meaningful with so many veterans in the extended family. He hoped the memory would stay with his son Cole, who plans to enlist.",
      "\u201cFor him, it\u2019ll be something he\u2019ll have forever,\u201d he said.",

      "The first group of immigrants are set to arrive at a new detention center deep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "OCHOPEE, Fla. -- The first group of immigrants were scheduled to arrive Wednesday night at a new detention center deep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the state's attorney general said.",
      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,\" Florida Republican Attorney General James Uthmeier said on the X social media platform. \"Next stop: back to where they came from.\u201d",
      "The facility, at an airport used for training, will have a capacity of about 3,000 detainees when fully operational, according to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The center was built in eight days over 10 miles (16 kilometers) of Everglades. It features more than 200 security cameras, 28,000-plus feet (8,500 meters) of barbed wire and 400 security personnel.",
      "Environmental groups and Native American tribes have protested against the center, contending it is a threat to the fragile Everglades system, would be cruel to detainees because of heat and mosquitoes, and is on land the tribes consider sacred.",
      "DeSantis and other state officials say locating the facility in the rugged and remote Florida Everglades is meant as a deterrent, and naming it after the notorious federal prison of Alcatraz, an island fortress known for its brutal conditions, is meant to send a message. It\u2019s another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying on scare tactics to try to persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.",
      "State and federal officials have touted the plans on social media and conservative airwaves, sharing a meme of a compound ringed with barbed wire and \u201cguarded\u201d by alligators wearing hats labeled \u201cICE\u201d for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Republican Party of Florida has taken to fundraising off the detention center, selling branded T-shirts and beer koozies emblazoned with the facility\u2019s name.",

      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants earmarked for immigrants\u2019 children and low-income students to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Haiti\u2019s gangs have gained \u201cnear-total control\u201d of the capital and authorities are unable to stop escalating violence across the impoverished Caribbean nation, senior U.N. officials warned Wednesday.",
      "An estimated 90% of the capital Port-au-Prince is now under control of criminal groups who are expanding attacks not only into surrounding areas but beyond into previously peaceful areas, Ghada Fathy Waly, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\u201cSouthern Haiti, which until recently was insulated from the violence, has seen a sharp increase in gang-related incidents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the east, criminal groups are exploiting land routes, including key crossings like Belladere and Malpasse, where attacks against police and customs officials have been reported.\u201d",
      "Waly said the state\u2019s authority to govern is rapidly shrinking as gang control expands with cascading effects. Criminal groups are stepping into the vacuum left by the absence or limited delivery of public services and are establishing \u201cparallel governance structures,\u201d and gang control of major trade routes has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for cooking fuel and rice, Haiti\u2019s staple food, she said.",
      "U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca told the council \u201cthe ongoing gang encirclement of Port-au-Prince\u201d and their strengthened foothold in the capital and beyond is \u201cpushing the situation closer to the brink.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout increased action by the international community, the total collapse of state presence in the capital could become a very real scenario,\u201d he warned.",
      "Gangs have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July 2021 and previously were estimated to control 85% of the capital. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination.",
      "A  U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 proposal in February to have the U.N. provide drones, fuel, ground and air transport and other non-lethal support to the Kenya-led mission has languished in the council.",
      "In response to the gangs, the UNODC\u2019s Waly said there has been a rapid growth in the number and activities of private security companies and vigilante self-defense groups, with some trying to protect their communities while others act illegally and collude with gangs.",
      "\u201cOver the last three months,\" Jenca said, \"these groups reportedly killed at least 100 men and one woman suspected of gang association or collaboration.\u201d",
      "He said the last three months have also seen an increase in sexual violence by gangs with the U.N. political mission in Haiti documenting 364 incidents of sexual violence involving 378 survivors just from March to April.",
      "A new report by U.N. experts covering the period from last October through February said the gangs have exploited political turmoil and the disorganized response to Haiti\u2019s security crisis, pointing to competing political ambitions and allegations of corruption within Haiti\u2019s transitional governing bodies that have stymied action.",
      "\u201cWhile the expansion of territorial control brings gangs additional sources of revenue and bargaining power,\u201d the experts said, \u201cthese attacks are also backed by individuals trying to destabilize the political transition for their own political goals.\u201d",
      "One major result is that very little progress has been made toward restoring public security or implementing the roadmap for organizing national elections by February 2026, the experts monitoring an arms embargo on Haiti and sanctions against key gang leaders said in the report to the Security Council.",
      "With a weak national police force facing acute tensions in its leadership, an army that needs rebuilding, and the limited ability of the multinational force, the experts warned that the gangs will continue \u201cto have the upper hand unless stronger international support is provided.\u201d",
      "As for vigilante groups, the experts said, they \u201coften include local police officers, some of whom actively participate in human rights violations.\u201d",
      "The Haitian National Police have also carried out \u201ca worrying number of extrajudicial killings \u2026 with suspected gang members often summarily executed,\u201d the experts said, pointing to 281 summary executions by specialized police units in 2024 including 22 women and 8 children.",
      "Despite the U.N. arms embargo on Haiti, gangs continue to obtain more powerful weapons not only from regional civilian markets but from police stockpiles in Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic, the experts said.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has vetoed a bill that would repeal an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate for power generation",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein vetoed legislation Wednesday that in part would repeal an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set for power generation in a 2021 law, arguing that the bill would have discouraged diverse energy sources and harmed consumers.",
      "The measure, which largely addresses activities involving Duke Energy \u2014 the state's dominant electric utility \u2014 would get rid of the current requirement that electric regulators take \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030.",
      "A directive in the 2021 law to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 stays in place with or without the legislation.",
      "Environmental critics who want cleaner energy sources to come online sooner urged Stein to veto the bill. They also were unhappy with other bill provisions that they argue will make Duke Energy more profitable and shift costs of producing or purchasing electricity to residential customers.",
      "The bill \u201cwalks back our state\u2019s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,\u201d Stein said in a news release. \u201cMy job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy. This bill fails that test.\u201d",
      "Stein, a former attorney general who took office in January, also vetoed two more bills Wednesday from dozens still on his desk left by the GOP-controlled legislature.",
      "These and four other recent Stein vetoes are subject to potential override votes, perhaps coming as soon as later this month. Speaking Wednesday only on the energy bill, House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger expressed confidence in successful overrides. Over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voted for the measure in June.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law was the result of a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "Now GOP supporters of the current bill say the 70% reduction mandate is unnecessary and will needlessly raise customer rates by requiring outsize growth for renewable sources like solar and wind power. The state Utilities Commission already pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years.",
      "By focusing on meeting the 2050 carbon-neutrality mandate, bill supporters say, regulators can direct Duke Energy, which backed the measure, to assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases.",
      "They cite an analysis performed by a state agency that represents utility customers that calculated the repeal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend on energy sources for the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents, which include several environmental groups, question the savings figure. And Stein cited another study in saying the bill could cost utility customers more through 2050 due to higher fuel costs.",
      "\u201cWe need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets,\u201d Stein added.",
      "At least 17 other states, most of them controlled by Democrats, have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "Environmentalists praised Stein's action and urged lawmakers to uphold the veto. \u201cStand instead for affordable energy and economic opportunity for all,\u201d said Dan Crawford of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters.",
      "Donald Bryson of the conservative-leaning John Locke Foundation urged an override, saying Stein \u201chas chosen ideology over affordability.\u201d",
      "Another vetoed measure Wednesday attempted to clarify and adjust powers of the state auditor \u2014 currently Republican Dave Boliek \u2014 including his ability to investigate alleged improper governmental activities of individuals, nonprofits and other groups that receive government funds.",
      "Stein's veto message said the auditor's \u201csweeping access\u201d in the bill to records of \u201cany private corporation that accepts any amount of state funding\u201d could undermine business recruitment efforts.",
      "Boliek said in a statement that Stein's veto \u201cundercuts the important principles of accountability and transparency that taxpayers expect from their government.\u201d",

      "A military veteran has been sentenced to life in prison for plotting to attack an FBI office and assassinate law enforcement officers",
      "WASHINGTON -- A military veteran was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for plotting to attack an FBI office and assassinate law enforcement officers in retaliation for his arrest on charges that he was part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, court records show.",
      "Edward Kelley was one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol. Nearly two years later, Kelley made plans with another man to attack the FBI office in Knoxville, Tennessee, using improvised explosive devices attached to vehicles and drones, according to prosecutors.",
      "Last November, a jury convicted Kelley of conspiring to murder federal employees, solicitation to commit a crime of violence and influencing federal officials by threat.",
      "Kelley, 36, received a pardon from President Donald Trump for his Jan. 6 convictions, but a judge agreed with prosecutors that Trump's action did not extend to Kelley's Tennessee case. That makes Kelley, who is from Maryvale, Tennessee, one of only a few Capitol riot defendants remaining in prison after the Republican president's sweeping act of clemency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Thomas Varlan handed down Kelley's life sentence during a hearing in Knoxville, according to court records. The judge denied a request for Kelley to be released pending the outcome of an appeal.",
      "Prosecutors had recommended a life sentence for Kelley, saying he was remorseless and incapable of rehabilitation.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Kelley served in the Marine Corps for eight years. He was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan before his 2015 discharge from the military.",
      "On Jan. 6, 2021, Kelley was captured on video helping two other rioters throw a Capitol Police officer onto the ground and using a piece of wood to damage a window, according to the FBI. He was the fourth person to enter the Capitol through a broken window, the FBI said.",
      "After a trial without a jury, a federal judge in Washington convicted Kelley last November of 11 counts stemming from the riot. Before Kelley could be sentenced, Trump pardoned him and hundreds of other convicted Capitol rioters.",
      "Kelley argued that his pardon was broad enough to cover his conduct in the Tennessee case, but the judge disagreed. Varlan said Kelley's crimes in the Tennessee case were separated from Kelley's conduct on Jan. 6 \u201cby years and miles.\u201d Prosecutors reached the same conclusion.",
      "In other Jan. 6 cases, however, Trump's Justice Department has argued that the pardons apply to separate convictions. For instance, prosecutors concluded that a Kentucky man's pardon for storming the Capitol also covered his conviction for illegally possessing guns when FBI agents searched his home for the Jan. 6 investigation.",
      "Kelley has been jailed since December 2022. His lawyer, Mark Brown, said Kelley did not hurt anybody or directly threaten anybody with violence. Brown urged the judge to reject prosecutors' request to apply a \u201cterrorism enhancement\u201d in calculating his client's sentence.",
      "\u201cKelley does not deserve the same sentence as an actual \u2018terrorist\u2019 who injured or killed hundreds or thousands of America citizens,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Kelley's co-defendant, Austin Carter, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in January 2024. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 4.",
      "Kelley created a list of 36 law-enforcement officers to target for assassination and shared it with Carter, calling it their first \u201cmission,\u201d according to prosecutors. All the officers were involved in Kelley's May 2022 arrest on Capitol riot charges and the FBI's search of his home.",
      "\u201cThe proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Kelley, Carter and a third man used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss plans, prosecutors said. Carter testified that he met with Kelley to conduct military-style training in November 2022.",
      "\u201cCarter\u2019s testimony was unequivocal \u2014 he had no doubts that, had he and Kelley not been arrested, the law enforcement personnel included on Kelley\u2019s list would have been murdered,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Kelley's attorney said the case involved \u201clittle to no planning.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscussions did not lead to action,\" Brown wrote. \"And while people may not like what Mr. Kelley had to say, he stands behind his position that he has a First Amendment right to free speech.\u201d",

      "An empty hospital in Williamston, North Carolina, offers an evocative illustration of why Republican Sen. Thom Tillis would buck his party and its leaders to vote down President Trump\u2019s signature domestic policy package",
      "WASHINGTON -- Though patients don't rush through the doors of this emergency room anymore, an empty hospital in Williamston, North Carolina, offers an evocative illustration of why Republican Sen. Thom Tillis would buck his party leaders to vote down President Donald Trump's signature domestic policy package.",
      "Martin General is one of a dozen hospitals that have closed in North Carolina over the last two decades. This is a problem that hospital systems and health experts warn may only worsen if the legislation passes with its $1 trillion cuts to the Medicaid program and new restrictions on enrollment in the coverage.",
      "Tillis' home state showcases the financial impact that more Medicaid dollars can have on hospitals in rural and poor regions throughout the country. Tillis said in a floor speech on Sunday, explaining his vote, that the GOP bill will siphon billions of dollars from Medicaid recipients and the health system in his state.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise,\u201d said Tillis, who has announced he will not seek re-election because of his opposition to the bill. Along with Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky, he joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "Tillis later accused the president and his colleagues of not fully grasping the full impact of the bill: \u201cWe owe it to the states to do the work to understand how these proposals affect them. How hard is that? I did it.\u201d",
      "For Martin General Hospital in Williamston, North Carolina\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid came just too late. The emergency room abruptly closed its doors in the eastern North Carolina county that's home to more than 20,000 people in August 2023. The closest hospital is now about a 30-minute drive away.",
      "Then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper faulted the state's failure to expand the Medicaid program to more low-income adults sooner to prevent Martin General's closure.",
      "North Carolina began offering Medicaid expansion to its residents in December. Today, more than 673,000 people are receiving this coverage.",
      "Now, Tillis and other state officials are worried the Republican bill, which will limit how much Medicaid money is sent back to providers, threatens funds for hospitals in their state again. And it could trigger a state Medicaid law that would close down North Carolina's otherwise successful expansion of coverage unless state legislators make changes or locate funds.",
      "The Medicaid dollars that Republicans seek to scale back in their bill have helped buttress the remaining rural hospitals across North Carolina, said Jay Ludlam, a deputy health secretary who leads North Carolina Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThis has been a lifeline for our rural hospitals here in North Carolina and has helped provide and keep them open,\u201d Ludlam said. \u201cRural hospitals play an integral role in communities both as a point of access for health care but also for the local economy because of the contributions that those hospital and hospital systems make to those communities.\u201d",
      "Republicans have responded to concerns with a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total.",
      "Around the country, 200 hospitals have closed or shuttered emergency services in the last two decades, many of them in red states across the southeastern and midwestern U.S.",
      "States that have declined to expand Medicaid coverage, the health insurance program for the poorest of Americans, have seen the closures accelerate. Tennessee, for example, has shed 500 beds since 2014, when a federal law first allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to a greater share of low-income people. It\u2019s one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid.",
      "More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure if the Republicans' bill becomes law, an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found last month. The center tracks rural hospital closures.",
      "\u201cSubstantial cuts to Medicaid or Medicare payments could increase the number of unprofitable rural hospitals and elevate their risk of financial distress,\u201d the analysis concluded. \u201cIn response, hospitals may be forced to reduce service lines, convert to a different type of health care facility, or close altogether.\u201d",

On the same day, images of President Donald Trump\u2019s smiling face appeared on several public monitors across the Manhattan campus.",

      "\u201cWe are investigating the scope of the apparent theft and will share our findings with the University community as well as anyone whose personal information was compromised,\u201d the school said.",

An online hacker who took credit for that action on social media said the intent was to prove the university was not in compliance with the Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions.",

      "Cardinal Robert Prevost made history by becoming the first pope from the United States \u2014 a stunning decision that Chicagoans celebrated by flocking to churches and sharing memes.",
      "Prevost was born in 1955 in the South Side Chicago neighborhood of Bronzeville and grew up in suburban Dolton, near St. Mary of the Assumption, where he attended Mass and elementary school. He later studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in the Hyde Park neighborhood and taught in local Catholic schools, including at St. Rita High School.",
      "Dolton Mayor Jason House called purchasing the pope's childhood home a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d during a Tuesday meeting of the Dolton Village Board. The childhood homes of other popes have often been turned into museums or pilgrimage sites.",
      "\u201cThis is a proud moment for our village and an opportunity, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing it justice,\" he said.",
      "Yet several residents at Tuesday's meeting were skeptical about any benefit to taxpayers, questioning whether the financially strained village could afford to purchase the home and maintain the streets surrounding it.",
      "The board hired former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to probe the village\u2019s finances last year, and she found Dolton\u2019s bank accounts had been depleted. The village was $3.65 million in debt and had unpaid bills piling up.",
      "Dolton gained national attention amid allegations of its former Mayor Tiffany Henyard's financial mismanagement, corruption and failure to follow state transparency laws by turning over spending and other records.",
      "\u201cPurchasing the pope\u2019s residence is admirable.\u201d Dolton resident Mary Avent told the board on Tuesday. \u201cBut with the state we\u2019re in right now, I guess my concern is, do we have the money?\"",
      "House said he is committed to repairing the streets surrounding Prevost's childhood home and assured residents he understood their concerns. Still, he said the sale will likely close within two weeks.",

      "\u201cWe can either seize this moment going forward or we can let that moment go to an investor,\" House said. \u201cI would like our community to get the benefit of this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Other board members echoed the mayor's excitement over the purchase, as some spoke of how the childhood homes of Michael Jackson and Martin Luther King Jr. offered economic opportunity to their communities. A recent post on the village's Facebook account showed workers repairing the house's roof and celebrated the home for \u201cbringing new energy and attention to our village.\u201d",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s liberal majority struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban on Wednesday, ruling 4-3 that it was superseded by a newer state law that criminalizes abortions only after a fetus can survive outside the womb.",
      "State lawmakers adopted the ban in 1849, making it a felony when anyone other than the mother \u201cintentionally destroys the life of an unborn child.\u201d",
      "It was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never officially repealed the ban, however, and conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision to overturn Roe reactivated it.",
      "Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit that year arguing that the ban was trumped by abortion restrictions legislators enacted during the nearly half-century that Roe was in effect. Kaul specifically cited a 1985 law that essentially permits abortions until viability. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, defended the ban in court, arguing that the 1849 ban could coexist with the newer abortion restrictions, just as different penalties for the same crime coexist.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled in 2023 that the 1849 ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. Abortions have been available in the state since that ruling but the state Supreme Court decision gives providers and patients more certainty that abortions will remain legal in Wisconsin.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a decision from a lower appellate court. It was expected as soon as the justices took the case that they would overturn the ban. Liberals hold a 4-3 majority on the court and one of them, Janet Protasiewicz, openly stated on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Democratic-backed Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel for an open seat on the court in April, ensuring liberals will maintain their 4-3 edge until at least 2028. Crawford has not been sworn in yet and was not part of Wednesday\u2019s ruling. She\u2019ll play pivotal role, though, in a separate Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin lawsuit challenging the 1849 ban\u2019s constitutionality. The high court decided last year to take that case. It\u2019s still pending.",

      "A statuette of St. John the Baptist stood by a bunch of fresh flowers, candles and burning desert sage in lieu of incense. There also were photographs of Tucker\u2019s late mom and their great-great-aunt, known as \u201cGrandma Juanita,\u201d whose advocacy preserved the camp. Juana is Spanish for Jane, so she celebrated her name day on St. John's and the family is continuing the tradition.",
      "A dozen cross-shaped saguaro fruit-picking poles leaned behind the table. Made from saguaro ribs, they're used to hook the fruits and push or pull them down from the towering plants.",
      "The history of encounters between Catholicism and Native spirituality has often been marred by violence and oppression. But many members of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation hold onto both faith traditions as they were passed down since the late 17th century, when an Italian-born Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Eusebio Kino, introduced Christianity to these remote deserts in what now are the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the lived consequence of trying to do Catholicism on their own,\u201d said Seth Schermerhorn, a Hamilton College professor who studies Indigenous adoption of Christian practices.",
      "Many O\u2019odham villages have mission churches, though a shortage of priests means regular Mass is a rarity. The Rev. Aro Varnabas came from his parish, Saint Kateri, to celebrate this service.",

      "The saguaro cactus is the iconic plant of the Arizona borderlands, and in June and early July, its fruit ripens",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Cousins Tanisha Tucker Lohse and Maria Francisco set off from their desert camp around dawn on most early summer days, in search of ripe fruit from the towering saguaro cactus, an icon of the Southwest that is crucial to the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u2019s spirituality.",
      "One plucks the small, thorn-covered fruits called \u201cbahidaj\u201d with a 10-foot-long (3-meter-long) stick made with a saguaro rib as the other catches them in a bucket. The harvest ritual is sacred to the O\u2019odham, who have lived for thousands of years in what are now U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and it's enjoying a renaissance as many seek to protect their traditional way of life.",
      "The fruit collected in late June is central to annual summer rain ceremonies, which mark the New Year. The laborious, weekslong harvest process also reinforces crucial connections to the Creator, the natural environment and fellow O\u2019odham across generations.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m surrounded by all the people that were here before us, all the ancestors,\u201d Francisco said in a desert wash lined with saguaros, flowering creosote bushes and spiny cholla cacti. \u201cWe talk about them constantly when we\u2019re out here.\u201d",
      "Foremost for the cousins' extended family is \u201cGrandma Juana.\u201d In the 1960s, elder Juanita Ahil campaigned to preserve their access to the harvesting camp in the foothills west of Tucson after the land became part of Saguaro National Park. Tucker Lohse\u2019s late mother, Stella Tucker, carried on the harvesting tradition that\u2019s now organized by the two cousins.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking on a big responsibility, a big legacy,\u201d said Tucker Lohse, who brought her 4-year-old daughter along this year. \u201cMy mom knows we\u2019re still here.\u201d",
      "Saguaros are the iconic plant of the Sonoran Desert, a land straddling the border between Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, that\u2019s surprisingly lush even though it receives less than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain yearly and summer temperatures routinely soar above 100 (38 degrees Celsius).",
      "The treelike cacti start to produce fruit at 30 years old, then sprout their trademark arms around 75 and live up to 200 years. Most of the fruit is near the top, which can be more than four times the average person\u2019s height, so the fruit of the tallest can be beyond their reach.",
      "They\u2019re an essential shelter and food source for desert creatures from mice to wrens, which is why harvesters \u2014 traces of whose camps date back to the 1500s \u2014 never pick them clean, Tucker Lohse said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t look at land and animals as a resource \u2014 we create a relationship,\u201d she said, echoing perspectives shared by Indigenous people across North and South America.",
      "For the O\u2019odham, the saguaros, or \u201cha:sa\u00f1\u201d in their language, provide far more than food, tools and shelter material \u2014 they\u2019re family.",
      "\u201cHa:sa\u00f1 to us are like people, and we respect them that way,\u201d said Silas Garcia, Francisco's partner. He started harvesting as a child with his aunt on the O\u2019odham reservation, which is one of the largest in the United States.",
      "Garcia said there is a specific creation story about the saguaros \u2014 though like many stories sacred to Native Americans, it cannot be told in summer \u2014 and their spiritual presence makes the harvest central to the O\u2019odham.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s being reconnected to the desert, to who I am, to where our stories talk about where we come from as a people,\u201d Garcia said as he built a mesquite wood fire to boil the sugary fruit pulp into syrup.",
      "Starting in May, O\u2019odham families check the saguaro buds. The fruit is usually ripe by mid-June, opening a one-to-four week harvesting window until the fruit is spoiled by the first summer monsoons.",
      "After picking the first fruit, harvesters praise the Creator, believed to reside in a nearby mountain peak, the Baboquivari, that has been the site of many rescues of migrants who tried to evade U.S. border authorities.",
      "Then they bless themselves with some of the pulp, often making a cross-like sign over their foreheads and hearts \u2014 for some, a reference to Christian beliefs many O'odham also embrace. They taste it and thank the saguaro for providing for them.",
      "When it\u2019s cut open \u2014 using the saguaro\u2019s dried-up flower as a knife and leaving the pods by the saguaro for animals \u2014 the fruit is the color of a ripe watermelon. It changes shades from fuchsia to blood red as it\u2019s processed at camp.",
      "After the pulp is boiled for about an hour, it\u2019s strained to remove any debris, fiber and seeds. The latter two are collected into patties that, after being dried in the relentless sun, make natural pectin for saguaro jam. Then the juice is cooked again, reducing it to a syrup, and its flowery, caramel-like smell pervades the camp.",
      "Since the syrup is one-tenth the quantity of the harvested fruit pulp, it takes a pair of harvesters about 10 hours in the desert to get enough to make 64 ounces (1.9 liters) of syrup.",
      "Finally, a bit of syrup is mixed with water and left to ferment to make wine for Nawait I\u2019i. That\u2019s the dayslong ceremony in which O\u2019odham pray together to their Creator to keep sending the monsoon rains that make it possible to plant traditional crops like beans, squash and corn.",
      "For many Native Americans, losing access to land, natural cycles of agriculture and the local foods that sustained them for centuries has meant spiking rates of diabetes, alcoholism and other diseases that disproportionately plague their communities.",
      "Too many elders lost their lives this way, putting at risk their language and traditions and more of their land.",
      "\u201cI watched them slowly pass away and no one took over,\u201d Tucker Lohse said. That\u2019s why she, Francisco and others push to teach youth about saguaro harvesting and other practices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really proud Maria has picked it up,\u201d said Francisco\u2019s mother, Josephine Ramon, adding that she\u2019s relearning some traditions she was taught as a child from her daughter.",
      "Ramon said she regrets not teaching the language to younger family members who lived off the reservation, as about one third of the nation\u2019s 30,000 members do.",
      "City living also distances many from heirloom crops, which the Indigenous-run San Xavier Co-op Farm just south of Tucson is trying to regenerate, said one of its managers, Amy Juan, who harvests near the cousins\u2019 camp.",
      "\u201cWith everything we do, there\u2019s a teaching of some sort,\u201d added Garcia, who said he's encouraged by programs on the reservation and beyond that help youth connect to their ancestral culture.",
      "Francine Larson Segundo, who also harvests nearby, said her grandparents taught her about planting and caring for the saguaro.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re people, and they are our people, and when we\u2019re gone, one will take our place,\u201d she said after picking the fruit for nearly two hours. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s younger than me, I have a responsibility to teach as much as I can.\u201d",
      "Francisco\u2019s aunt Helen Ramon, widely known as \u201cGrandma Helen,\u201d stopped by. She\u2019s especially adamant about instilling in youth the need to treat the natural environment with the same respect due to fellow beings.",
      "\u201cThey need to carry on our traditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose our ways of being Native.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe fire will take time to cool, and once it does, explosive experts must safely enter the site to assess and secure the area,\u201d the Yolo County Sheriff's Office said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "The fire was held at nearly 80 acres (33 hectares) as of Wednesday morning after scorching surrounding agricultural fields, officials said.",
      "The property is owned by \"an active pyrotechnic license holder,\u201d Cal Fire said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis type of incident is very rare, as facilities like this are required to not only follow our stringent California pyrotechnic requirements, but also federal explosive storage requirements.\u201d",
      "The state fire marshal\u2019s website listed the license for the facility as belonging to Blackstar Fireworks. The owner who was listed did not respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment.",

      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a dea...",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty.",
      "Bryan Kohberger agreed to the plea deal in the past few days, just weeks before his trial was to begin, after his attorneys tried but failed to have execution stricken as a possible punishment. The deal drew mixed reactions from the victims' families, ranging from support to outrage that Kohberger would live.",
      "\u201cBryan Kohberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships, and engage with the world,\u201d Aubrie Goncalves, the 18-year-old sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves, wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cMeanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever. That reality stings more deeply when it feels like the system is protecting his future more than honoring the victims\u2019 pasts.\u201d",
      "The small farming community of Moscow, in the northern Idaho panhandle, had not had a homicide in about five years when Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were found dead at a rental home near campus on Nov. 13, 2022. Autopsies showed the four victims were all likely asleep when they were attacked. Some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times.",
      "The killings prompted a massive hunt for the perpetrator. That included an elaborate effort to track down a white sedan that was seen on surveillance cameras repeatedly driving by the rental home, using genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger as a possible suspect, and using cellphone data to pinpoint his movements the night of the killings.",
      "At the time, Kohberger was a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, about 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) west of the University of Idaho. He was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his parents lived, weeks later. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "Online shopping records showed that Kohberger had purchased a military-style knife months earlier \u2014 as well as a sheath like the one found at the scene.",
      "No motive has emerged for the killings, nor is it clear why the attacker spared two roommates who were in the home. Authorities have said cellphone data and surveillance video show that Kohberger visited the victims\u2019 neighborhood at least a dozen times before the killings.",
      "Kohberger is due to appear at 11 a.m. MDT Wednesday before Idaho Fourth Judicial District Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, where the case was moved due to pretrial publicity in northern Idaho. Hippler must approve the plea deal. If Kohberger pleads guilty as expected, he would likely be sentenced in July.",
      "While the Goncalves family opposed the agreement and said they would seek to stop it, they also argued that any such deal should require Kohberger to make a full confession, detail the facts of what happened and provide the location of the murder weapon.",
      "\"We deserve to know when the beginning of the end was,\u201d they wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "The family of Chapin \u2014 one of three triplets who attended the university together \u2014 supports the deal, their spokesperson, Christina Teves, said Tuesday. Attorney Leander James, who represents Mogen\u2019s mother and stepfather, declined to give their views but said he would deliver a statement on their behalf after Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Mogen\u2019s father, Ben Mogen, told CBS News he was relieved by the agreement.",
      "\u201cWe can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don\u2019t want to have to be at, that we shouldn\u2019t have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get to just think about the rest of lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and the rest of the kids.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal status for more than 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in New York on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal status for more than 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States.",
      "District Court Judge Brian M. Cogan in New York ruled that moving up the expiration of the temporary protected status, or TPS, by at least five months for Haitians, some of whom have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, is unlawful.",
      "The Biden administration had extended Haiti\u2019s TPS status through at least Feb. 3, 2026, due to gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and several other factors, according to court documents.",
      "But last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating those legal protections as soon as Sept. 2, setting Haitians up for potential deportation. The department said the conditions in the country had improved and Haitians no longer met the conditions for the temporary legal protections.",
      "The ruling comes as President Donald Trump works to end protections and programs for immigrants as part of his mass deportations promises.",
      "The judge's 23-page opinion states that the Department of Homeland Security 's move to terminate the legal protections early violates the TPS statute that requires a certain amount of notice before reconsidering a designation.",
      "\u201cWhen the Government confers a benefit over a fixed period of time, a beneficiary can reasonably expect to receive that benefit at least until the end of that fixed period,\u201d according to the ruling.",
      "The judge also referenced the fact that the plaintiffs have started jobs, enrolled in schools and begun receiving medical treatment with the expectations that the country's TPS designation would run through the end of the year.",
      "Manny Pastreich, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ, which filed the lawsuit, described the ruling as an \u201cimportant step\u201d but said the fight is not over.",
      "\u201cWe will keep fighting to make sure this decision is upheld,\" Pastreich said in a statement. \"We will keep fighting for the rights of our members and all immigrants against the Trump Administration \u2013 in the streets, in the workplace, and in the courts as well. And when we fight, we win.\"",
      "DHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment. But the government had argued that TPS is a temporary program and thus \u201cthe termination of a country\u2019s TPS designation is a possibility beneficiaries must always expect.\"",
      "Haiti's TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after the catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Gang violence has displaced 1.3 million people across Haiti as the local government and international community struggle with the spiraling crisis, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. There has been a 24% increase in displaced people since December, with gunmen having chased 11% of Haiti\u2019s nearly 12 million inhabitants from their home, the report said.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The order put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept the legal protections in place.",
      "The judge's decision in New York also comes on the heels of the Trump administration revoking legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the U.S. through a humanitarian parole program.",

      "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. -- The leader of an MS-13 clique in the suburbs of New York City faces sentencing Wednesday in a federal racketeering case involving eight murders, including the 2016 killings of two high school girls that focused the nation\u2019s attention on the violent Central American street gang.",
      "Alexi Saenz pleaded guilty last year for his role in ordering and approving the killings as well as other crimes during a rash of bloody violence that prompted President Donald Trump to make several visits to Long Island and call for the death penalty for Saenz and other gang members during his first term in the White House.",
      "Saenz\u2019s lawyers are seeking a sentence of 45 years behind bars, but prosecutors want the judge to impose the maximum sentence of 70 years.",
      "Prosecutors, who previously withdrew their intent to seek the death penalty, say Saenz deserves to live out his days in prison for his \u201csenseless\u201d and \u201csadistic\u201d crimes.",
      "\u201cThe eight victims who lost their lives did nothing to deserve what the MS-13 did to them,\u201d they wrote in legal filings ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThe defendant and the others killed them in service of the gang without remorse or any regard for them as human beings.\u201d",
      "But Saenz's lawyers have argued for leniency, saying in their own legal filings that the now-30-year-old is remorseful and \u201con a journey of redemption\u201d while incarcerated.",
      "\"With the passage of time and much reflection, it is hard for Mr. Saenz to reconcile the person he is today with the person he was when he committed the crimes,\" their sentencing memo reads. \u201cHe is profoundly sorry, and although he knows the families may not accept his apology, it is sincere, and he accepts full responsibility for his participation in these crimes.\u201d",
      "Saenz's lawyers also say he suffers from intellectual disabilities and lasting trauma from an abusive father and difficult upbringing in El Salvador. They say Saenz was recruited and unwittingly \u201cgroomed\u201d into MS-13 because he was an \u201ceasily influenced\u201d and \u201cgullible\u201d high school student on Long Island.",
      "Prosecutors, however, counter that Saenz has remained \u201cfirmly entrenched\u201d in MS-13 while in a federal lockup in Brooklyn for the past eight years.",
      "They cited photos of him posing with other gang members behind bars and displaying gang signs and gang paraphernalia. They also say Saenz has been disciplined for assaulting other inmates, refusing staff orders and possessing sharpened metal shanks, cellphones and other contraband.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the same pattern of violence and mayhem that has marked his life on the street has not waned with the passage of time,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Saenz, also known as \u201cBlasty\u201d and \u201cBig Homie,\u201d was the leader of an MS-13 clique operating in Brentwood and Central Islip known as Sailors Locos Salvatruchas Westside.",
      "He admitted last July that he\u2019d authorized the eight killings and three other attempted killings of perceived rivals and others that had disrespected or feuded with the clique.",
      "Saenz also admitted to arson, firearms offenses and drug trafficking \u2014 the proceeds of which went toward buying firearms, more drugs and providing contributions to the wider MS-13 gang.",
      "Among the killings Saenz oversaw were the deaths of Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15, lifelong friends and classmates at Brentwood High School who were slain with a machete and a baseball bat.",
      "Other victims included Javier Castillo, 15, of Central Islip, who was befriended by gang members only to be cut down with a machete in an isolated marsh.",
      "Another victim, Oscar Acosta, 19, was found dead in a wooded area near railroad tracks nearly five months after he left his Brentwood home to play soccer.",
      "MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal organization believed to have been founded as a neighborhood street gang in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s by people fleeing civil war in El Salvador.",

      "The statement did not mention China by name, but Chinese domination of the critical minerals supply chain has long been a concern of the U.S. and others.

      "The ministers also condemned North Korea for continuing to launch ballistic missiles, expand its nuclear weapons program and engage in malicious cyberactivity. In a veiled reference to North Korean support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, they expressed \u201cdeep concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with North Korea, which directly undermines the global nonproliferation regime.\u201d",

      "Bauer, a wealthy developer, is a longtime backer of President Donald Trump. His candidacy sets up a midterm grudge match with Graham, a four-term senator whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years, but who has Trump's endorsement for reelection.",
      "Bauer has described himself as \u201ca real, America First conservative\u201d intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives\u2019 true values.",
      "\u201cI think Graham's been there too long, and he votes like it,\u201d Bauer told The Associated Press Tuesday night. \u201cI'm guaranteed, I'm conservative, and I don't think he is.\"",
      "Republicans dominate South Carolina\u2019s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries.",
      "Graham has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change.

      "Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February, and at least one other Republican has also announced a primary challenge.",
      "He has already secured Trump\u2019s endorsement. This week, Graham's campaign announced that Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 bid, would serve as a senior adviser. On Tuesday, Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for Graham\u2019s campaign, noted that the senator had earned Trump\u2019s \u201ccomplete and total endorsement,\u201d adding that Bauer \u201chas spent his career chasing titles to feed his ego.\u201d",

      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he denied bail for Combs because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs was convicted of two counts of prostitution-related charges. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.",
      "Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said Wednesday, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "After leaving court, Combs' attorney declined to comment on the bail denial, saying \"a lot of these things are still in process.\"",
      "\"We are not nearly done fighting,\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters outside U.S. district court in lower Manhattan. \"Today was a major major step in the right direction, but we fight on and we're gonna win, and we're not gonna stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.\"",
      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend Jane, the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he was held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",
      "The attorneys cited conditions under the Bail Reform Act that states \"a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense is entitled to release pending sentencing if the Court finds by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he 'is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.'\"",
      "Federal prosecutors, however, argued the Bail Reform Act dictates that Combs should remain in custody.",
      "In their filing to the judge, prosecutors said the crimes Combs was convicted of \"constitute crimes of violence and mandate detention following the defendant's conviction.\"",
      "\"As detention is mandatory following a conviction of a Mann Act offense, the Government has been unable to locate a case in which a defendant was released from custody following such a conviction,\" prosecutors said.",

      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs' attorneys didn't call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" and \"hotel nights\"",
      "The high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.",
      "Ventura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the \"freak-offs\" to make Combs happy.",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial wanted to review some of the testimony from the hip-hop mogul's former longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura during the second day of deliberations Tuesday.",
      "The panel of eight men and four women continued deliberating the charges against Combs after not reaching a verdict on the first day of deliberations.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",
      "To help them come to a verdict, jurors were provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Five alternate jurors\u00a0are also on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury.",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of at times\u00a0graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\" Defense lawyers argued that there was no conspiracy and that his conduct did not violate federal laws.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-corenswet-director-james-gunn-on-a-more-down-to-earth-superman/",
    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Separately, \"Rust\" armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March 2024. Prosecutors accused Gutierrez-Reed of unwittingly bringing live ammunition on set and failing to follow basic gun safety protocols. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison.

      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",

      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",

      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",

Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

    "story": [
      "Former NFL player Corey Parchman appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday to discuss his new book \"IVF Playbook for Men,\" sharing his personal experience with infertility and advocating for greater awareness of male fertility issues.",
      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",
      "\"I'm a person that's a fixer. I fix things. This situation I had to sit back and put the faith in my doctors and my wife,\" he explained. \"Once you get out of your own way and realize it's not about you, it's about your family, the process becomes easier.\"",
      "Parchman said there's an importance of open communication between partners during fertility treatments. He and his wife created what he called a \"safe space\" where they could express their feelings without judgment.",
      "The book also addresses how to handle well-meaning but often misguided advice from friends and family. Parchman advised giving people grace while recognizing that their suggestions may not be helpful.",
      "\"I had friends tell me, 'Eat three eggs and spin around and jump,'\" he said. \"Thanks for the advice, but I'm listening to the doctors.\"",
      "Beyond becoming a father, Parchman said the IVF journey transformed his understanding of masculinity. He now advocates for men to be more vulnerable and open about their struggles.",
      "\"It's being vulnerable, creating a space to express how you feel with your partner or friends,\" he said. \"I want to speak out and tell men it's okay to speak out about your feelings and thoughts because we all have them.\"",

    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",

      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

The filing comes just weeks after the struggling company laid off 40 employees\u00a0in a second wave of job cuts following the dismissal of roughly a third of its staff in August of 2024.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:55:26 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

      "Del Monte Foods, whose canned vegetables and fruit have long been a staple on grocery store shelves,\u00a0announced\u00a0Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy and will seek a buyer.",
      "The nearly 140-year-old company is entering Chapter 11 proceedings as part of a restructuring support agreement (RSA) with its lenders.",
      "\"After a thorough evaluation of all available options, we determined a court-supervised sale process is the most effective way to accelerate our turnaround and create a stronger and enduring Del Monte Foods,\" Greg Longstreet, president and CEO of Del Monte Foods, said in a statement.",
      "Del Monte did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The canned-goods producer, based in Walnut Creek, California, said it has secured a commitment for $912.5 million from its lenders that will help fund the company throughout the going-concern  sale process and allow it to continue operating.",
      "Del Monte has between $1 billion to $10 billion in both estimated liabilities and assets, according to its court filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. The sale, the California-based company said in its statement, will involve \"all or substantially all of the Company's assets.\" In its search for a new buyer, Del Monte said it would prioritize the highest or best offer.",
      "Changing consumer preferences",
      "Del Monte is the fourth company in the food and beverage sector to file for Chapter 11 according to data from Debtwire, a data analytics firm.",
      "\"Generally, Del Monte says that consumer demand has declined, causing it to incur increased costs related to surplus inventory that it has had to warehouse and attempt to move off shelves with increased promotional spending,\" said Sarah Foss, global head of legal and restructuring at Debtwire, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Consumer preferences have shifted away from preservative-laden canned food in favor of healthier alternatives,\" she added.",
      "The move follows a challenging few years for the company, which has issued layoffs and made efforts to downsize to cut costs. Del Monte last year started a debt overhaul, according to Bloomberg.",

    "summary": "The owner of an Oklahoma maker of guitar pedals has had to get creative to absorb higher import costs.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses facing higher import costs because of steeper U.S. tariffs are having to find different ways of handling the added expense.",
      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",
      "\"We can't find a source outside of China for our potentiometer, which is critical for our designs,\" Keeley said. \"Even when we call companies in Taiwan, they say they get theirs from China.\"",
      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paramount will settle President Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million, the company announced late Tuesday.",
      "CBS News' parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and the plaintiffs' fees and costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.",
      "The settlement did not include an apology.",
      "Paramount also agreed that \"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawsuit, filed last October when he was still a candidate for president, was widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment. He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",
      "Weeks later, Wendy McMahon, who served as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, announced she was also departing. \"It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on a path forward,\" she wrote in a note to staffers.",
      "First Amendment scholars and constitutional experts largely viewed the lawsuit as a frivolous misapplication of the law.",
      "Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, explained, \"That statute is about sales \u2014 a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"",
      "Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Noah Feldman called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"",
      "Politicians had also spoken out about the suit, urging Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone not to settle. The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",
      "The FCC's approval is necessary for Paramount's $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media to move ahead, and the agency didn't make a decision on the transaction by the informal 180-day deadline to review mergers, which passed in May. Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",
      "If completed, the Paramount-Skydance merger will cap off a long, turbulent sales process that attracted multiple potential bidders. Talks between Skydance and Paramount's corporate parent, National Amusements, were briefly called off before the sides resumed negotiations and clinched a deal in July 2024.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:17:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

      "\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact \u2014 in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",
      "The president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.",
      "Although Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.",
      "The Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans \u2014 steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.",
      "\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\"",

      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips could soon come to fruition after the Senate passed President Trump's massive budget package.",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "Senators narrowly approved the legislation, which Republicans call the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" on July 1 by a vote of 51-50. The measure now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the bill and urged lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "Musk\u00a0reignited a squabble with Mr. Trump\u00a0on Saturday by again criticizing the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which President Trump is urging Congress to pass by July 4. The Tesla founder and CEO wrote on X that the bill would \"destroy millions of jobs in America.\" He also suggested\u00a0on Monday that, should the bill pass, he would form a new political party and support primary challenges against any Republicans who voted in favor of the legislation.",
      "President Trump clapped back early Tuesday, noting the enormous federal subsidies Musk's various companies receive from the government and suggesting that the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which Musk led before stepping down late May \u2014 look into any spending flowing into Musk's empire.",
      "Despite the flare-up, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives expects the conflict between Musk and Mr. Trump to die down moving forward.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:11:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "Additionally, cost increases for parts and other intermediate inputs could take time to work their way through supply chains before they show up in consumer prices.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk, the world's richest person, reignited his criticism Monday of the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package working its way through the Senate on Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the Trump-backed bill.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0lashed out at Musk in an early Tuesday morning Truth Social post that noted Tesla has benefitted from federal electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 a program the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would phase out. The president also suggested DOGE should \"take a good, hard, look at\" other subsidies Musk has benefitted from.",
      "\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Musk responded to Mr. Trump's message: \"I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.\"",
      "Why is Musk opposed to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"?",
      "Many of Musk's criticisms zero in on the bill's price tag, calling its spending levels \"insane\" and attacking a provision in the Senate version of the bill that hikes the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "But the billionaire has also panned the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits and excise tax on certain renewable energy projects, calling those provisions \"utter madness\" that could \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.\"",
      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

      "GE Appliances executive Lee Lagomarcino said U.S. trade policy was the driving factor in the company's recent decision to accelerate a plan to move overseas jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Any time we decide to move a factory or redesign a platform, it's an expensive endeavor, so we have to think through the strategy and trajectory of market,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in discussing GE Appliances' move to expedite a shift in production of its washers and dryers from China to the U.S. in order to avoid having to pay\u00a0stiffer tariffs.",
      "\"This was the right time to strike on the business opportunity given the environment with tariffs,\" added Lagomarcino, vice president, clothes care, at GE Appliances.",
      "GE Appliances on June 26\u00a0announced it would invest $490 million in a laundry care manufacturing plant in Kentucky that would create 800 new American jobs. In a statement last week, GE Appliances CEO Kevin Nolan said the reshoring effort \"aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\"",
      "The company, which has long planned to reshore manufacturing to the U.S., said that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have impelled the household appliance maker to \"accelerate the decision-making,\" Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Once the plant is fully up and running, the company, a Haier subsidiary, will cease manufacturing in China. \"That factory will turn off when the factory in Louisville, Kentucky turns on,\" said Lagomarcino, adding that he expects the Kentucky plant to be operational by early 2027.",
      "What jobs is GE creating in the U.S.?",
      "The company is looking to fill research and development, engineering and supply chain positions at the Kentucky plant, openings for which it's already started posting on its careers site.",
      "\"We anticipate a lot of hiring for some skilled trades, and technically advanced manufacturing roles,\" Lagomarcino said. \"Our research and development team leader will need to hire more engineers, and our supply chain leader will have to hire to fill jobs.\"",
      "Why now?",
      "The investment in domestic manufacturing comes as a host of U.S. companies\u00a0announce plans\u00a0to reshore operations as they face added costs from Mr. Trump's tariff agenda.",
      "But the main force behind the production move to Louisville is GE's \"zero distance\" philosophy of building appliances where they are sold, the company said in the announcement.",
      "\"U.S. manufacturing allows us to be closer to the consumer and the team that designs and markets the products and is involved in the whole product development lifecycle,\" said Lagormarcino. \"Philosophically, and from a manufacturing and design standpoint, it makes sense.\"",
      "That said, the move makes even more sense with tariff increases in place, according to Lagormarcino.",

      "More than 95% of the fireworks sold in the U.S. come from China, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And while sales of pyrotechnics have grown in past years as more states and counties loosen restrictions, tariffs have snarled some firework importers' plans this year.",

      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\"This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \"Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\"",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock - the names of the previous teams - would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn't get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This tax provision was removed from the final version of the Senate bill that\u00a0passed on Tuesday, July 1. Read more here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

      "\"The man that left on January 6 was not the man that came home in the early hours of January 7,\" Smith told CBS News this week. \"He was a different person. His personality changed. His demeanor changed. He was there, but the man that I knew was not in the same body.\"",
      "The 35-year-old Smith died by suicide on Jan. 15, 2021, as he was driving to work for the first time since the Capitol riot.",
      "In 2022, Erin Smith filed a wrongful death lawsuit for assault and battery against 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, alleging that he had assaulted her husband during the Capitol riot.",
      "In January 2023, Walls-Kaufman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor federal count of \"parading, demonstrating and picketing in a Capitol building\" in connection with the insurrection. At the time, he acknowledged that he had \"scuffled\" with law enforcement, but did not face any federal assault charges in the case.",
      "He served 60 days in prison on that misdemeanor charge. He was one of hundreds of Capitol insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump in January.",
      "Despite the pardon, Smith's lawsuit went to trial in June. After a lengthy civil trial and just two hours of deliberations, a jury last week ordered Walls-Kaufman to pay her and her late husband's estate $500,000, finding that Walls-Kaufman had assaulted Jeffrey Smith on Jan. 6.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Walls-Kaufman denied striking Smith and called the lawsuit and the verdict \"sadistic.\"",

      "As the House met Wednesday to take up the bill, which squeaked through the Senate a day earlier, it remained unclear if Republicans have enough support to get it over the finish line. The House needs to take a key procedural vote before it can move toward final passage, but it's not clear when that vote will take place or if it will pass. Lawmakers remained stuck on a separate vote for over six hours Wednesday afternoon.",
      "House GOP leaders are aiming to move ahead quickly on the\u00a0signature legislation\u00a0of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, which includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by substantial cuts to health care and nutrition programs.",
      "But some House Republicans, who voted to pass an earlier version of the bill in May, are unhappy with the Senate's changes.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, were meeting with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House puts pressure on House Republicans to get the bill across the finish line, which one lawmaker called \"very productive.\" But GOP Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters that he expected the procedural vote to fail in the afternoon.",
      "One key Republican, Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson, announced on X Wednesday evening that he'd support the bill. It \"isn't perfect, but it's the best we'll get,\" he wrote, adding that he would support the rule and final passage. Davidson was one of two Republicans who voted against the bill when the House first voted on the measure in May.",

He described the meeting as \"very productive\" but didn't say whether he will ultimately vote yes, telling reporters he's still trying to learn more about how the bill will be implemented if it passes.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May. He said the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred.\"",
      "The Senate-passed bill includes steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction.",
      "Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday that \"we are working through everybody's issues and making sure that we can secure this vote\" amid the opposition. He added that he and the president are working to \"convince everybody that this is the very best product that we can produce.\"",
      "\"I feel good about where we are and where we're headed,\" Johnson added.",
      "Harris told reporters Wednesday that that the president should call the Senate back into town to come to an agreement on changes to the bill. GOP leaders, however, said the House would vote on the Senate bill \"as-is.\"",
      "Should the House make changes to the bill, the revisions would require the Senate's approval, or force the two chambers to go to conference committee to iron out a final product that the two bodies could agree on, jeopardizing the bill's timely passage.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, seemed optimistic after the White House meetings with holdouts Wednesday, saying \"Donald Trump is a closer\" and adding that \"members are moving to yes.\"",
      "\"I know there are some members who think they're going to vote no right now,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"I think when the choice becomes failure or passage, they're going to understand that passage beats the hell out of failing.\"",

Rob Bresnahan and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Reps. David Valadao and Young Kim of California.",

      "The United States is halting some weapons shipments to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, the White House confirmed Tuesday.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that the \"decision was made to put America's interests first following\" a Defense Department \"review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe.\"",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News the move was over concerns about U.S. military stockpiles falling too low.",
      "The Trump administration did not confirm which weapons were being pulled from delivery or the scale of the pullback.",
      "Kelly added, \"The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned \u2014 just ask Iran,\" in reference to the U.S. strikes last month on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Elbridge Colby, Defense Department under secretary for policy, said in a separate statement Tuesday night in response to the move that the \"Department of Defense continues to provide the resident with robust options to continue military aid to Ukraine, consistent with his goal of bringing this tragic war to an end. At the same time, the department is rigorously examining and adapting its approach to achieving this objective while also preserving U.S. forces' readiness for administration defense priorities.\"",
      "A White House official said Wednesday the pause in shipments to Ukraine is part of a larger review that the Pentagon has been conducting of weapons shipments to all countries that receive them from the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth began this review weeks ago at the direction of President Trump. The official said the review was undertaken to ensure the Pentagon under the previous administration was \"prioritizing America's needs.\"",
      "Although the Ukraine pause is what leaked to the media, the White House official said some other countries have been \"reclassified\" as well, meaning, they have been de-prioritized for receiving weapons and munitions from the U.S. The White House official did not name those countries, or say\u00a0 how long the pause in some weapons shipments to Ukraine may last.",
      "The U.S. has provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military aid since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "In early March, following a confrontational Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the White House announced it was pausing military aid to Ukraine that had already been earmarked by the Biden administration. It also said it was pausing intelligence sharing to Ukraine.",
      "The pause on both fronts was lifted about a week later when Ukraine responded positively to talks over a potential ceasefire, which never materialized at the time.",
      "Then, in late April, the U.S. and Ukraine reached a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral reserves. As part of the tenets of the deal, according to Ukrainian officials, the U.S. would contribute in the form of military assistance to a joint U.S.-Ukraine fund.",
      "Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute military think tank, told CBS News in March that about 20% of Ukraine's military hardware is supplied by the U.S., with 25% provided by Europe and the rest of the world, and 55% produced in Ukraine.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of a group of migrants seeking asylum and three immigrants' rights groups.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Trump's plan to sharply restrict access to the nation's asylum system, a blow to the president's sweeping crackdown on immigration into the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of 13 individuals seeking asylum in the U.S. and three immigrants' rights groups who argued that a proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on his first day back in office \u2014 which has been a pillar of his immigration agenda \u2014 is unlawful.",
      "In his decision, Moss ruled that neither the Immigration and Nationality Act nor the Constitution give the president and administration officials \"the sweeping authority\" asserted in his proclamation and subsequent guidance implementing the directive.",
      "\"The court recognizes that the executive branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country,\" he wrote. \"But the INA, by its terms, provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country.\"",
      "Moss said that a pair of provisions of federal immigration law do not provide \"the president with the unilateral authority to limit the rights of aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum.\"",
      "He further found that the Constitution does not give the president the authority to \"adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted and the regulations that the responsible agencies have promulgated.\"",
      "In addition to finding Mr. Trump's plan to limit access to asylum, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request to certify a class of all people covered by the president's proclamation or its implementation who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "The judge postponed the effective date of his class-wide order for 14 days to give the Trump administration time to seek emergency relief from the federal appeals court in Washington. He also put off a decision on whether to certify a class of individuals who were subject to Mr. Trump's new asylum rules and are no longer in the U.S.",
      "\"The significance of the decision cannot be overstated,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs. \"The ruling not only means the U.S. will once again be a safe haven for those fleeing persecution but also reaffirms that the laws Congress enacts must be respected by the president.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has rolled out a series of plans aimed at targeting migrants in the U.S. His efforts began on the first day of his second term, when Mr. Trump took unilateral action to prevent most migrants crossing the southern border from applying for asylum or withholding of removal, a type of relief that prevents the Department of Homeland Security from deporting a migrant to their home country because of likely persecution.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation cited an alleged \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and directed administration officials to take action to \"repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States.\"",
      "The migrants and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration in early February and sought to block enforcement of the president's proclamation, arguing it is \"as unlawful as it is unprecedented.\"",
      "Moss, appointed by former President Barack Obama, held a hearing in April to consider their bid to invalidate the plan.",
      "In his decision, the judge found that neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and National Act authorize the changes in immigration law that Mr. Trump has sought to make.",
      "He wrote that the president \"lacks the inherent constitutional authority\" to supplant federal statutes governing removals.",
      "\"To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional,\" Moss wrote.",
      "As with his first term, immigration has remained a focal point of the president's second term, and he has undertaken a number of actions that he says are aimed at targeting the purported \"invasion\" at the southern border. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have sparked legal battles. Mr. Trump has invoked a 1798 wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua and has ended programs put in place by former President Joe Biden that shielded nearly 1 million migrants from the threat of deportation.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration cannot cut off legal status and work permits for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants this fall, a federal judge ruled late Tuesday.",
      "The ruling by Brooklyn-based U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush in 2006, prevents Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from following through on a plan to revoke temporary protected status, or TPS, of Haitians living in the U.S. under the program on Sept. 3, a few months before their status was set to expire under a Biden-era deadline.",
      "Nearly 350,000 people from Haiti are currently enrolled in the TPS program, which allows migrants to remain in the U.S. if their home country is unsafe due to war or natural disaster. The federal government first granted TPS designation to Haiti in 2010, and the Biden administration extended it for Haitian migrants until February 2026.",
      "DHS announced Friday that benefits will instead end in September, and unless migrants qualify for some other form of legal status, they will lose their right to work and may face deportation.",
      "In his ruling Tuesday, Hogan sided with a group of Haitian migrants who sued over the end to TPS for the Caribbean nation. The judge wrote that Noem \"does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation.\"",
      "Hogan said the DHS secretary \"cannot reconsider Haiti's TPS designation in a way that takes effect before February 3, 2026, the expiration of the most recent previous extension.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have enrolled in schools, taken jobs, and begun courses of medical treatment in the United States in reliance on Haiti's TPS designation lasting until at least February 3, 2026,\" Hogan wrote in the 23-page ruling.",
      "The White House says the administration will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"District courts have no authority to prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws or from terminating discretionary temporary benefit programs,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. She added that the administration \"trusts that this unlawful order will meet the same fate similar injunctions have met in the Supreme Court. And President Trump will continue delivering on his promises to end the exploitation of our immigration system.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement the ruling \"delays justice and seeks to kneecap the President's constitutionally vested powers.\"",
      "\"Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet that's how previous administrations have used it for decades,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "DHS argued last week that TPS is intended to be temporary, and the \"environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\" But advocates warn Haiti is wracked by persistent gang violence and health problems.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed to wind down TPS for several other countries, including Venezuela and Afghanistan. The Supreme Court allowed the administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants in a late May decision, reversing a lower court ruling.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

    "summary": "Three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission were fired by President Trump in May.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to allow him to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The request to the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision earlier this month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028. The commission sets consumer product safety standards, can order product recalls and bring civil suits against companies.",
      "The three members were told in May that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Removal restrictions like those governing the Consumer Product Safety Commission have been put in place by Congress to insulate independent agencies from politics. But Mr. Trump has sought to test his removal powers through a series of firings targeting members of those entities.",
      "Following their firings, the commissioners sued and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid earlier this month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court is the third involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which the administration has argued is generally unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two federal independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court said in its unsigned decision that it \"reflects our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\"",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the earlier removals should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to act immediately and issue a brief administrative stay that would allow it more time to consider his request for emergency relief. Lawyers for the commissioners opposed that request for swift action, noting that they have been serving in their roles in the nearly three weeks since the district judge ruled in their favor.",
      "The Trump administration, the lawyers said, did not identify any harm that would stem from the commissioner's continued service during the time it will take for the Supreme Court to rule.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has selected a new headquarters building in Washington, D.C., after nearly two decades of failed attempts to find a permanent new space, the Bureau announced on Tuesday.",
      "The FBI has been headquartered in downtown D.C. at the J. Edgar Hoover building since 1975 but structural problems have plagued the building for the last 20 years, leading to redevelopment and relocation projects that until Thursday had not successfully been resolved.",
      "\"This is a historic moment for the FBI,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement, adding he is \"ushering FBI Headquarters into a new era and providing our agents of justice a safer place to work.\"",
      "The Bureau and the U.S. General Services Administration selected the Ronald Reagan Building, blocks away from the Hoover building, as the new location. It was home to the U.S. Agency for International Development until this year, when the Trump administration consolidated USAID into the State Department and allowed Customs and Border Protection to take over the building's lease.",
      "\"Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,\" Patel continued.",
      "It is unclear when the FBI will begin its transition out of the Hoover building.",
      "In a March speech at the Justice Department, President Trump said his administration is \"going to build another big FBI building right where it is, which would have been the right place, because the FBI and the DOJ have to be near each other.\"",
      "\"They were going to build an FBI headquarters three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that the state's political leadership had \"no bearing\" on his decision to cancel a previous Biden administration plan to move the headquarters to Maryland.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump abandoned a plan to move the FBI to one of three locations in Maryland or Virginia, instead proposing a smaller headquarters in Washington to replace the Hoover building.",
      "Under the Biden administration in 2023, the GSA\u00a0chose a site in Greenbelt, Maryland, to serve as the new location for the FBI headquarters. The decision came after a 15-year debate on whether the headquarters should be relocated to Maryland or Virginia.",
      "Democratic members of Congress from Maryland blasted the decision to scrap plans for a new Maryland headquarters, saying that Congress \"appropriated funds specifically for the purpose of the new, consolidated campus to be built in Maryland.\"",
      "\"Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities,\" the Maryland lawmakers said in a joint statement. \"That's why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have.\"",
      "In May, Patel told Congress his goal is to move about 10% of the Bureau's Washington workforce \u2014 about 1,500 people \u2014 away from the D.C. area and redeploy them across the country, including a sizable number of personnel at the FBI's facility in Huntsville, Alabama.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk is floating a new political party dubbed the \"America Party\" \u2014 but the idea could face major hurdles.",
    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. Musk raised the idea again this week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 and this time, Musk put a time limit on the plan.",
      "\"If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,\" Musk wrote in a post on X Monday evening, hours before the bill passed the Senate on Tuesday and headed back to the House. \"Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.\"",
      "It remains unclear if Musk will follow through on his pledge, but the idea could be easier said than done. If Musk decides to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures, and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money, but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration says it apprehended just over 6,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border last month.",
    "story": [
      "The number of migrants caught crossing the southern border illegally set a new historic monthly low in June, continuing an extraordinary lull in illegal immigration the Trump administration has attributed to its aggressive deportation efforts, preliminary government data obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "Last month, Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border recorded just over 6,000 apprehensions of migrants who entered the country without authorization, the lowest monthly tally ever reported by the agency, according to the preliminary Customs and Border Protection data. The previous monthly low reported by Border Patrol was in March, when the agency recorded around 7,200 migrant apprehensions.",
      "The numbers stand in stark contrast to the record levels of apprehensions made by Border Patrol under the Biden administration, which faced a humanitarian, political and operational crisis of unprecedented proportions at the southern border until it implemented restrictive asylum measures last year.",
      "During many months of former President Joe Biden's tenure, Border Patrol recorded more than 6,000 apprehensions each day. At their peak in late 2023, daily illegal crossings at the southern border topped 10,000 on some days.",
      "Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, confirmed the roughly 6,000 Border Patrol apprehensions recorded in June. He added that Border Patrol did not release a single migrant for a second consecutive month. During some months under the Biden administration, tens of thousands of migrants were released into the U.S. with instructions to show up in immigration court to plead their cases.",
      "\"We have never seen numbers this low. Never,\" Homan wrote on X.",
      "While Border Patrol has not publicly reported monthly apprehension data before fiscal year 2000, the last time the agency averaged close to 6,000 migrant interdictions per month over a year was in the late 1960s, historical figures indicate.",
      "Immediately after taking office in January, President Trump empowered border officials to swiftly deport migrants \u2014 without hearing their asylum claims \u2014 under an emergency proclamation he argued was needed to quell an \"invasion.\" That policy is being challenged in court by civil rights advocates, who argue it violates U.S. asylum law. Immigration authorities were also directed to halt all releases, absent life-threatening circumstances.",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border, tasking them with repelling illegal crossings through the construction of barriers. Along some parts of the border with Mexico, the U.S. military has set up zones where soldiers can temporarily detain migrants before transferring them to immigration officials.",
      "In the interior of the country, the Trump administration has tasked Immigration and Customs Enforcement with overseeing large-scale arrests of immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. Last week, the number of individuals held in ICE detention set a record high.",
      "Amid the historic lull in illegal crossings, hundreds of Border Patrol agents have been assigned to help ICE with immigration arrests away from the border, in places like Los Angeles.",
      "The administration has also staged an intense messaging campaign to compel immigrants in the U.S. illegally to self-deport. It has offered them carrots in the form of travel assistance through a government smartphone app and a $1,000 self-deportation bonus.",
      "But it has also threatened those who refuse to leave with arrest and forcible deportation, and even the possibility of ending up detained at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, a tent facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" or a maximum-security mega prison in El Salvador.",
      "Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown has not been without criticism. In communities across the U.S., especially Democratic-led cities, videos of masked federal agents arresting unauthorized immigrants at courthouses or outside homes have triggered outcry from local residents and politicians.",
      "Some Republicans have urged the Trump administration to prioritize the arrest of migrants with serious criminal records amid concerns that its crackdown is extending well beyond the dangerous individuals the president promised to expel. Recent figures show fewer than 10% of those booked in ICE detention in recent months were convicted of violent crimes.",

      "The president said Qatar and Egypt \u2014 who have previously helped mediate talks with Hamas \u2014 \"will deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next Monday. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects to discuss both Gaza and Iran, which struck a separate ceasefire deal with Israel last week after a 12-day campaign between the two countries that included U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump said a ceasefire could begin \"sometime next week.\"",
      "Prior pushes for a ceasefire have stalled. In late May, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire that would have required Hamas to release 10 living hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as the remains of another 18 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel would have released 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas said it responded with \"notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called Hamas' response \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "The war began when Hamas launched a terror attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with an intense air and ground offensive in the Palestinian territory, killing more than 56,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The two sides have agreed to two prior ceasefire and hostage release deals since the start of the 21-month conflict, the most recent of which ran from January to March.",
      "Since then, Netanyahu has said there is \"no way\" he will agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated, though he left the door open to cutting deals to release hostages.",
      "Israel said Tuesday it had \"expanded its operations to additional areas within the Gaza Strip, eliminating dozens of terrorists.\" Hamas' health ministry said Tuesday some 116 people had been killed across the territory over a 24-hour period.",
      "Separately, in recent weeks, the U.S. has financially supported a controversial new group to distribute food in the Gaza Strip, but the effort has faced frequent reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces near food distribution sites. The group, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has defended its efforts.",

Mr. Trump joked in his remarks that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\"",
      "Mr. Trump invited the press to join his tour of the makeshift facility, which he called \"so professional and so well done.\" Rows of bunk beds were lined up behind chain fences.",
      "The president was asked if it could be a model going forward for other detention sites. \"It can be,\" he responded, adding that such a location is rare. Mr. Trump said he'd like to see similar temporary facilities in \"many states.\"",
      "DeSantis said they expect the first occupants of the detention center to arrive Wednesday. DeSantis said the site has been modified in just eight days to accommodate detainees, and he called the center an \"effective way\" to increase the numbers of removals and deportations of unauthorized immigrants as the state seeks to help the federal government's deportation efforts.",
      "The facility will have up to several thousand beds to house, process and deport individuals who were in the country illegally. Florida officials say the site will have at least 200 security cameras, at least 28,000 feet of barbed wire, 400-plus security personnel, and 24/7 air conditioning.",
      "In a roundtable alongside Mr. Trump, Noem told people who are in the country illegally and who may be watching on TV that they can still \"self-deport\" and get the chance to return to the United States legally in the future.",
      "\"If you don't, you may end up here,\" Noem said. \"And you may end up here and being processed, deported out of this country, and never get the chance to come back.\"",
      "DeSantis echoed Noem's message. \"Why would you want to come through 'Alligator Alcatraz' if you can just go home on your own?\" DeSantis said. \" I think a lot of people are going to make that decision.\"",
      "Protesters have gathered outside the gates as construction work proceeded on the site in recent days, and a crowd of demonstrators turned out again Tuesday to protest Mr. Trump's visit, CBS News Miami reported.",
      "Phyllis Andrews, a retired teacher who drove in from Naples, Florida, to join the protest, told The Associated Press, \"I have a lot of immigrants I have been working with. They are fine people. They do not deserve to be incarcerated here.\"",
      "Noem announced last week that the detention facilities in Florida will be funded \"in large part\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of FEMA's shelter and services program, an initiative created by Congress to support groups and cities receiving migrants and asylum-seekers released from federal custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"There is only one road leading in and the only way out is a one-way flight,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. \"It is isolated, and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain.\"",
      "\"They ain't going anywhere once they're there, unless you want them to go somewhere,\" DeSantis said Monday. \"Because good luck getting to civilization. So the security is amazing \u2014 natural and otherwise.\"",
      "Critics of the project include former U.S. Rep. David Jolly, an ex-Republican who is now running for Florida governor as a Democrat, who called the facility a \"callous political stunt.\"",
      "Where is \"Alligator Alcatraz\"? Map shows site in South Florida",
      "The site of the temporary migrant detention facility in Ochopee, Florida, is located deep in the Everglades, about 50 miles west of Miami, in a wetlands ecosystem known as Big Cypress Swamp.",
      "History of \"Alligator Alcatraz\" site in Florida Everglades",
      "According to the\u00a0National Park Service, Florida officials in the 1960s proposed building a futuristic jetport in the area to support South Florida's booming population. The Dade County Port Authority purchased 39 square miles of remote swampland with plans to build what would have been the largest airport in the world.",
      "But opposition to the Everglades Jetport grew, and the early work on the facility halted in 1970 after a federal report determined that it would \"inexorably destroy the South Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park.\"",
      "Instead, in the 1970s, a smaller portion of the land was developed into the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, known as TNT, an aviation training facility with only one runway.",
      "The site has about 900 acres of developed and operational land, while the remaining area is managed and operated by the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.",
      "On June 19, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed using the TNT site for a temporary facility to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. He said the facility could be set up on the already constructed runway.",
      "Last week,\u00a0environmental groups\u00a0filed a lawsuit to block the opening of the facility until it undergoes\u00a0an environmental review\u00a0as required by federal law.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:17:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes that stretched more than 24 hours, delivering a major victory for the president and bringing the signature piece of legislation of his second term one step closer to his desk.",
      "The measure passed in a 51 to 50 vote, with all but three Republicans supporting the bill. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "The vote came after the Senate worked through the weekend and into a scheduled recess to pass the bill, which now returns to the House for sign-off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the measure, and pushed lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "The legislation's passage also marks a significant victory for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who worked to sway GOP holdouts to back the legislation amid opposition on multiple fronts that threatened to thwart the bill's progress in recent days.",
      "\"This was an incredible victory for the American people,\" Thune said after the vote.",
      "Known by the GOP as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would increase federal deficits by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "While some Republicans had taken issue with the legislation's impact on the deficit, others cited concern with some of the steep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO has said would leave nearly 12 million more Americans without health coverage over the coming years. And with a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders could only afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vance as a tie-breaker. But those concerns were not enough to defeat the legislation, and last-minute changes secured the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, while apparently quelling other possible opponents to the bill.",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed news of the vote during a trip to Florida. \"There is something for everyone [in the bill], and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, met with possible holdouts in his office as the vote series stretched late Monday and into the wee hours Tuesday. The majority leader met with fiscal hawks including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida, and at another point in the night, he met with Paul, who had pledged to oppose the bill over a provision raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Thune also talked briefly with Murkowski early Tuesday, since it appeared likely that her vote could make or break the bill in the Senate. The Alaska Republican had concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs and their impact on her state.",
      "Murkowski told reporters after the vote that her thought process on the bill was \"agonizing.\"",
      "\"I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" Murkowski said, citing the cuts to social safety net programs. But she outlined the unique conditions in her state, and the support Alaska received in the final version of the bill, saying \"I had to look on balance because people in my state are the ones that I put first.\"",
      "In a statement later in the afternoon, Murkowski said, \"My sincere hope is that this is not the final product.\"",
      "\"This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President's desk,\" she wrote. \"We need to work together to get this right.\"",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts, including the fiscal hawks, Murkowski and Collins.",
      "Paul and Tillis were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and they both voted against the legislation on final passage. With a handful of other possible opponents, Thune told reporters overnight that GOP leaders were working to determine what \"everybody has to have in terms of votes,\" a sign that the vote would come down to the wire.",
      "The Senate action comes after the House narrowly passed the bill last month. Senate Republicans worked to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed. The House could return to Washington as early as Wednesday to begin consideration of the revised bill.",
      "Senate Republicans passed the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP entered a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the July 4 deadline.",
      "Senate Democrats combated the legislation in one of the only ways available to them: by delaying the process. Democrats forced the bill to be read in its entirety over the weekend, totaling nearly 16 hours, before using debate time to rail against the bill, and proposing amendments to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "On Monday, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions, to no avail. As the votes stretched overnight Monday and into Tuesday, senators voted on a handful of notable amendments, including a near-unanimous vote to eliminate language from the bill that would have put a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The Senate also approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements preventing payments for people who are deceased.",
      "An amendment proposed by Collins that would have increased the rural hospital stabilization fund from $25 billion to $50 billion and imposed a higher tax rate on the wealthy to pay for the larger fund fell short. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that the amendment was like putting a \"band aid on an amputation \u2014 it doesn't fix the problem.\" The outcome made it less likely that Collins would ultimately support the bill, although the change was expected to be included in a wide-ranging amendment to the bill.",
      "During the marathon vote series, the Senate also addressed an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Though Democrats railed against the move as the \"nuclear option,\" the chamber voted along party lines to affirm the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "Schumer lambasted the bill after the vote, criticizing Republicans for bowing to the president.",
      "\"The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,\" Schumer said.",
      "Cristina  Corujo, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be \"no rational basis\" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have \"devastating consequences\" across the country if enacted.",
      "The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March.",
      "Their complaint warned of \"severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible\" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially \"paralyzing\" the agency \"by means of a confusing reorganization.\"",
      "\"Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,\" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction.",
      "\"HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,\" she added.",
      "The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states.",
      "The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "\"The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\" DuBose wrote.",
      "As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.",
      "Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations.",
      "\"HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net \u2014 from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,\" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling.",
      "In May, a federal court in California blocked the Trump administration's mass layoff attempts, including at HHS, though the Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a lower court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "\"The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,\" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill.",
      "Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies.",
      "Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted.",
      "A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA.",
      "But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to \"balance out\" the jobs that were restored.",
      "\"At that point, we will make decisions. And, you know, in some cases, there have been gaps in our ability to perform our duties. I've brought people back,\" Kennedy said.",

      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China.

    "summary": "The move is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from the New World screwworm fly, which could devastate its beef industry and even kill household pets.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",

    "story": [
      "CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementill, 53,\u00a0guilty of murder and conspiracy\u00a0for masterminding the murder of her husband Fabio, with special circumstances of murder for financial gain and murder while lying in wait.",
      "When Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker were arrested and accused of a murder conspiracy to kill Monica's husband, Fabio Sementilli, 49, their love affair continued in jail according to documents revealed in a \"48 Hours\" investigation of the case. Prosecutors allege their ongoing love affair behind bars, including recordings made during police sting operations, represent further evidence of a committed murder conspiracy between the lovebirds.",
      "\"It kind of hurts to not be touched or f***** or licked or loved by you,\" Monica, now 52, writes in one four-page letter to her codefendant. Baker, now 61, is blunt, recorded addressing Sementilli in lockup months after their arrest, \"I love you baby. I really do.\"",
      "On June 14, 2017, Baker and Monica were arrested and ultimately indicted for Fabio's murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Baker pleaded no contest\u00a0in July 2023, accepting a life sentence without parole. Monica will stand trial alone in April; she has pleaded not guilty. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in \"The Monica Sementilli Affair\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "On the day of their arrest, according to a recording released by police, Monica tells a cellmate how much Baker means to her: \"He's not just my lover, he's my confidant, he's my everything.\"",
      "Police engaged in an elaborate series of sting operations to continue to investigate the alleged conspiracy between the defendants even while they were held in custody, \"48 Hours\" has discovered. Police alternately used standard and creative means to intercept or record the defendants' interactions and statements, all of which is being offered as evidence of conspiracy in Monica's upcoming trial.",
      "For instance, \"48 Hours\" has confirmed that the cellmate to whom Monica spoke when she was first detained was an undercover police officer posing as an inmate to catch Monica speaking candidly on surreptitious recordings. Police call these types of jailhouse setups where officers pose as inmates inside jail Perkins Operations, referring to the case law which guides how these in-jail, sting operations are conducted.",
      "In the course of our investigation, \"48 Hours\" has learned that police went to even greater lengths than using undercover officers inside cells to ensnare Monica and Baker. As the two defendants were brought to courtrooms for their initial pre-trial hearings, detectives made arrangements for them to be held in adjoining cells prior to the hearings.",
      "Waiting in nearby cells to be brought into the courtroom, Monica and Baker had an opportunity to speak directly to each other. On six different occasions, first at the Van Nuys Courthouse and then at the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse, interactions between Monica and Baker were recorded.",
      "Beyond the sting operations, detectives also intercepted jail letters, referred to by inmates as \"kites,\" and listened to recorded jail phone calls to establish facts about the enduring love affair between Monica and Baker.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has obtained copies of three different jail love letters written from Monica to Baker which we have learned police intercepted while Monica intended to pass them to Baker in courthouse holding cells. \"48 Hours\" has learned that the detectives discovered the letters in holding cells while Monica and Baker attended the hearings. The detectives hastily made copies before carefully returning them for the inmates to retrieve after the hearings so that the defendants were unaware the love letters had been intercepted and copied.",
      "Meanwhile, Monica's defense has repeatedly argued, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\"",
      "According to prosecutors the information gleaned from these operations establishes that the ongoing jailhouse love affair is further evidence of the murder conspiracy between the accused.",
      "\"In essence, the defendants have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves. Rather, they have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves,\" wrote Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman.",
      "The unusual situation where the two inmates could speak to each other while detained was designed by law enforcement purposely to record conversations between the unwitting defendants.",
      "Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker used secret code to express love and commitment inside jail, prosecutors cite as evidence of murder conspiracy",
      "According to a 2021 motion filed by the prosecutor, the recordings and intercepted love letters are evidence of an ongoing \"secrecy pact\" between the accused.",
      "\"The defendants often communicated with one another using cryptic language, phrases and codes created in order to secretly communicate without law enforcement's knowledge,\" including, \"the phrases, 'OMM,' '9pm,' 'LOML,' and '100,'\" according to a prosecution filing.",
      "Prosecutors allege these coded phrases establish the defendants' love and commitment not only to each other, but also the \"conspiracy\" and \"secrecy pact\" between them. \"OMM,\" they allege, means \"On My Mind,\" while they say \"9pm\" is a reference to a secretive plan to break jail rules and set timing for a phone call where a third party will connect the two to speak directly. The prosecutors contend \"LOML\" is an \"acronym meaning 'Love of My Life' and '100' indicates their 100% commitment to one another.\"",
      "According to prosecutors, another significant phrase is the one written at the end of one of Monica's love letters, \"R or D,\" an alleged abbreviation for the phrase \"Ride or Die.\"",
      "Detectives found a drawing \"depicting a couple embracing one another wearing only underwear and ski masks while holding guns\" in Baker's cellphone \"entitled 'Ride or Die.'\" There is a statement above the drawing, \"A relationship where you both love, protect and spoil each other is the best.\"",
      "\"The phrase 'Ride or Die' was frequently used between the defendants as an expression of their commitment to one another and their secrecy pact. On several occasions defendants expressed that they would remain loyal to one another, and never 'talk' to law enforcement about their conspiracy; in their words, they would 'Ride or Die' for one another,\" the 2021 filing asserts.",
      "Robert Baker and Monica Sementilli allegedly play sex games during recorded jailhouse encounters arranged and recorded by police",
      "The two lovers took advantage of six rendezvous engineered by detectives, according to motions filed in court. Monica and Baker were recorded \"talking to one another and engaging in masturbation and other sex games,\" wrote the prosecutor. The judge has ruled the alleged sex games portions of these recordings will not be admissible. Nevertheless, these encounters purportedly reveal the passionate nature of their continuing relationship in jail.",
      "Baker confirmed the sex games during an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours\" on March 2. That's what happens when you are stuck in here, he said, gesturing to the jail side of the glass from where he talked to a reporter over a phone.",
      "Once those encounters stopped, the jailhouse co-defendants and lovebirds found ways to break the rules and remain in contact, according to prosecutors. In that 2021 filing, prosecutors said \"over the course of the last four years, the defendants made hundreds of calls through third parties \u2026 This allows them to speak to one another.\"",
      "These phone recordings have been shared with the defense as discovery but have not been made public.",
      "In excerpts reviewed by \"48 Hours\" from two of the six recorded encounters, there is talk of marriage, and in her letters, Monica consistently refers to herself as \"Mrs. Baker,\" \"Monica Baker\" and \"your wifey.\" \"MB\" is a code prosecutors allege is an abbreviation of Monica Baker.",
      "\"The defendants have continued to refer to one another as husband and wife while in custody for murdering Sementilli's legitimate husband,\" wrote the prosecutor, who cites this as dedication, not only to each other, but also to their murder conspiracy.",
      "Before the grand jury, prosecutor Silverman argued that the lovers' commitment motivated the conspiracy, saying they were \"plotting to kill [Fabio] in order to collect his substantial life insurance monies and be able to live hopefully happily ever after.\"",
      "Monica's attorneys have repeatedly challenged the evidence of a love affair as irrelevant to proving evidence of a murder conspiracy. There is no doubt, however, that Monica and Baker's\u00a0 commitment to their affair endured at least during the early months in jail, even for years according to the prosecutor.",
      "\"We will get married \u2026 You are the perfect wife for me. Beyond belief. My mind is like, I'm delirious,\" Baker says to Monica in a lockup recording.",
      "Similarly, she gushes to her lover as she ends a three-page-long letter, or \"kite,\" intercepted on Aug. 6, 2017, with \"Love your wifey\u2026 Monica Baker 'til death. R or D\"",
      "In jail sting, Robert Baker mentions Monica Sementilli facing \"difficulty\" of being \"disowned\" for loving and wanting to marry him",
      "\"48 Hours\" has identified one comment relating to this alleged jailhouse marriage talk that may indicate a separate issue at play in the murder conspiracy allegations.",
      "During the grand jury hearings, prosecutor Silverman argued divorce was not an option for Monica, so the couple instead turned to murder.",
      "\"She's from an Italian family, which means Catholic. They don't believe in divorce, her family won't, it won't be easy for them to take it \u2026 So again this provides a motive,\" said Silverman.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys have challenged this testimony as flimsy and misinterpreted, insisting the prosecutor has not established that divorce troubled Monica.",
      "However, in one of the recorded conversations between Baker and Monica on Aug. 31, 2017, which police refer to as \"lockup overhears,\" Baker seems to make a stunning admission regarding Monica while they discuss their desire to get married.",
      "\"So, when you gonna tell them \u2026 when you \u2026 when you gonna tell them \u2026 how we gonna tell 'em we're gonna get married? How we gonna do this? Then you'll really be officially disowned for loving somebody,\" Baker says in a seeming reference to Monica getting disowned for their relationship. Monica responds, \"I don't know \u2026 I think we may need to wait \u2026 until the trial, and see what happens with that.\"",
      "Baker then says, \"I'm not the one that has the, difficulty you do.\"",
      "The transcript made public in the prosecutor's motion is only an incomplete excerpt of the conversation. Nevertheless, this portion of the jailhouse exchange recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department seems to establish that Monica being \"disowned\" over her love for Baker may have been an issue for the lovers. Furthermore, Baker seems to confirm it as a \"difficulty\" for Monica. It is a tantalizing piece of a conversation, raising a significant issue that will almost certainly come into play during her trial.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys \"are not commenting on any evidence until it is presented at trial,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine.",
      "Although it is unclear if the two defendants remain in contact today, after six years of incarceration, evidence appears to demonstrate the stunning revelation they remained dedicated to a relationship in the months after their arrest, perhaps extending for years. These love letters, sex games and promises seem to have continued even after Monica learned that evidence implicated Baker as her husband's killer.",
      "In an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that now the two are prevented from contacting each other.\u00a0 He said, the last time they spoke, in a random encounter passing each other in lockup, she cursed him as a murderer. He did not indicate when this exchange occurred.",
      "Calling Baker a murderer would represent a significant turn in Monica's attitude, as evidenced through August 2017 in the jail letters and recordings. In his interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that Monica took no part in a murder conspiracy and that he acted without her knowledge.",
      "Prosecutors dismiss the idea that Monica was not involved, detailing 56 overt acts which they argue constitute the conspiracy between the two lovers to murder the celebrity hairstylist turned beauty industry executive.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys intend to call Baker as a witness during Monica's trial.",
      "\"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said Levine after Baker's sentencing.",
      "Whether or not Monica Sementilli's love affair with killer Robert Baker constitutes evidence of a criminal conspiracy or simply passionate infidelity will be at the heart of Fabio's wife's trial for his murder. Prosecutors plan to enter details of that love affair dating as far back as one year before the crime, continuing after Fabio's murder, and as revealed by \"48 Hours\"' investigation, even while the two were locked up awaiting trial.",
      "On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, 53,\u00a0guilty of murder and conspiracy\u00a0for masterminding the murder of her husband Fabio, with special circumstances of murder for financial gain and murder while lying in wait. On June 23, 2025, Monica Sementilli was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She plans to appeal.",

      "But some House Republicans, who voted to pass an earlier version of the bill in May, are unhappy with the Senate's changes.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, were meeting with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House puts pressure on House Republicans to get the bill across the finish line, which one lawmaker called \"very productive.\" But GOP Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters that he expected the procedural vote to fail in the afternoon.",
      "One key Republican, Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson, announced on X Wednesday evening that he'd support the bill. It \"isn't perfect, but it's the best we'll get,\" he wrote, adding that he would support the rule and final passage. Davidson was one of two Republicans who voted against the bill when the House first voted on the measure in May.",
      "The president kept up the pressure, posting on Truth Social about June's low border crossing statistics and adding, \"All we need to do is keep it this way, which is exactly why Republicans need to pass \"THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL.\"",
      "Immigration agents \"need more help and, they are counting on Republicans to, GET IT DONE,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said earlier Wednesday afternoon that lawmakers were planning to forge ahead with the procedural vote, but they were waiting for the return of some members whose flights to Washington were delayed. Those members are expected to arrive \"shortly,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",
      "Several members on both sides of the aisle had their flights canceled or delayed by bad weather as they raced back to Washington for the vote. All the Democrats appeared to be on hand for proceedings by Wednesday afternoon. Republicans can only afford three defections if all members are present and voting.",
      "The House Rules Committee advanced the Senate's changes to the bill overnight, setting up the action on the floor. GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas joined Democrats on the panel to oppose the rule. Both are among the group of hardliners who are likely to oppose the procedural vote in the full House.",
      "\"What the Senate did is unconscionable,\" Norman said. \"I'll vote against it here and I'll vote against it on the floor until we get it right.\"",
      "Hours later, Norman returned to the Capitol following a meeting with Mr. Trump and other House Republicans. He described the meeting as \"very productive\" but didn't say whether he will ultimately vote yes, telling reporters he's still trying to learn more about how the bill will be implemented if it passes.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May. He said the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred.\"",
      "The Senate-passed bill includes steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction.",
      "Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday that \"we are working through everybody's issues and making sure that we can secure this vote\" amid the opposition. He added that he and the president are working to \"convince everybody that this is the very best product that we can produce.\"",
      "\"I feel good about where we are and where we're headed,\" Johnson added.",
      "Harris told reporters Wednesday that that the president should call the Senate back into town to come to an agreement on changes to the bill. GOP leaders, however, said the House would vote on the Senate bill \"as-is.\"",
      "Should the House make changes to the bill, the revisions would require the Senate's approval, or force the two chambers to go to conference committee to iron out a final product that the two bodies could agree on, jeopardizing the bill's timely passage.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, seemed optimistic after the White House meetings with holdouts Wednesday, saying \"Donald Trump is a closer\" and adding that \"members are moving to yes.\"",
      "\"I know there are some members who think they're going to vote no right now,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"I think when the choice becomes failure or passage, they're going to understand that passage beats the hell out of failing.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post\u00a0Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump urged the GOP to get the bill done, saying to his party, \"don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around.\"",
      "\"We've got all the cards, and we are going to use them,\" he said.",
      "GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina likewise urged House Republicans to get the bill to the president's desk Wednesday.",
      "\"President Trump has his pen in hand and is waiting for the House to complete its work,\" Foxx said. \"We've championed this legislation for months, have guided it through the appropriate processes, and now we're on the one-yard line.\"",
      "Meanwhile, with few levers to combat the bill's passage, House Democrats spoke out forcefully against the legislation.",
      "\"We will not stand by and watch Trump and his billionaire friends destroy this country without putting up one hell of a fight,\" Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said, calling the bill a \"massive betrayal of the American people.\"",
      "Jeffries said that \"every single House Democrat will vote 'hell no' against this one, big ugly bill,\" while adding that \"all we need are four House Republicans to join us in defense of their constituents who will suffer mightily from this bill.\" Democratic leaders called out some Republicans by name, including Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Reps. David Valadao and Young Kim of California.",
      "\"It's unconscionable, it's unacceptable, it's un-American, and House Democrats are committing to you that we're going to do everything in our power to stop it,\" Jeffries said. \"All we need are four Republicans, just four.\"",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, Robert Baker tells \"48 Hours\" Monica Sementilli \"did not know\" about the murder and had no involvement. Baker's testimony could help Sementilli in her upcoming murder conspiracy trial.",
    "story": [
      "It's an awkward moment sitting down with a murderer especially when you arrive unannounced.",
      "Robert Baker, 61, who pleaded no contest last summer to the 2017 Los Angeles murder of famed hairstylist and beauty industry executive Fabio Sementilli, 49, approached the glass that separated us with a \"who are you?\" look on his face.",
      "As a producer for \"48 Hours\" who has followed the case since 2017, I made the trip to Los Angeles' North County Correctional Facility on March 2 to see if Baker would be willing to share information about the brutal crime and, perhaps, his alleged accomplice\u00a0Monica Sementilli, 52. Monica was the wife of victim\u00a0Fabio Sementilli, and she was Baker's lover before they both landed in jail, nearly five months after the crime, accused of conspiracy to commit murder. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in\u00a0\"The Monica Sementilli Affair,\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Baker seemed healthy and younger looking than the bedraggled figure I remembered from court. He had the fit and muscular appearance one might expect from a racquetball coach at the LA Fitness where he met Monica Sementilli, a mother of two teenage daughters living in a nearby, upscale L.A. neighborhood.",
      "Once I introduced myself, it was Baker who offered the initial icebreaker to our conversation, expressing surprise at the effort I had taken to find him in that remote jail in the mountain town of Castaic. Getting there can be a one-hour drive from L.A., and visitors are only permitted on Saturdays and Sundays. There are two separate intake areas to pass through, which involves a bus ride \u2013 not to mention security, where a reporter must leave pens, recorders and phones behind.",
      "So, the effort had paid off, it got the conversation started, and earned me credibility for finding him. These meetings can be difficult. The main issue is we are being recorded and the cops and prosecutors who put Baker away and have plans to put his former lover away listen, and presumably can and will use anything he says against him \u2013 or her \u2013 if possible.",
      "Nevertheless, our conversation moved along.\u00a0 Baker had an easy wide smile with a gap between his front teeth. The phone receivers we each used had short cords so that kept us face to face, staring straight into each other's eyes, from about 20 inches apart through safety glass.",
      "Despite his reluctance to address most issues, deferring answers to \"when this is all over\" (meaning the end of Monica's upcoming trial which starts April 2), he was resolute about one point: Monica was not involved in the murder, as she is charged.",
      "\"Monica did not know.\u00a0 She didn't know s***.\u00a0 If she did find out, I would have been in here (jail) a lot sooner,\" he said. His claim was a bombshell.\u00a0 Monica, who has already spent nearly six years in jail, did not conspire with him to kill her husband Fabio, he said.",
      "Despite what the prosecutor characterizes as overwhelming circumstantial evidence against Monica, there is no smoking gun connecting her to the conspiracy.\u00a0 A fact her attorneys are banking on for a not guilty verdict at trial.",
      "Why did Robert Baker plead guilty without a deal?",
      "I asked about his decision to plead no contest despite not getting a deal and accepting the sentence of life without parole. With his blood and DNA at the crime scene, having cut his finger stabbing Fabio to death, Baker had little chance to beat the charges. But even if his chances at trial were one in a million, most people take that shot. \"Why not you?\" I asked him.",
      "He seemed resigned to his fate but explained \"due process\" was the reason. Much of our conversation shifted to facial expressions, as he was clearly reluctant to be recorded saying certain things. I found myself unconsciously following his lead \u2014   and at that moment, I gave him an exaggerated \"What does that mean?\" face.",
      "\"You think there's due process?\" he responded to my look, as if I was the naivest person on earth to have faith in the criminal justice system that snared him.\u00a0 The phrase due process would serve as his unsatisfying default answer for many substantive questions.",
      "I asked if his plea was \"a gift\" for Monica, which he immediately scoffed at, seemingly taking offense, as if going down for life could be a gift.",
      "I pointed out, what he knew well, that for more than five years Monica's attorneys had tried many times to sever the cases against the lovebirds into separate trials, but the judge denied them at each turn.\u00a0 So, I noted when Baker pleaded no contest, voil\u00e0, thanks to his decision, Monica got what she had been asking for, to stand trial alone.\u00a0 He remained dismissive.",
      "I asked if he had met Monica in a Target parking lot two miles from the Sementilli home in the hours before the murder, as the prosecutor alleged, presumably to get the 'coast is clear' message from Monica to attack and kill Fabio.",
      "That allegation prompted an eyes wide open, lips pursed, \"no way\" expression as he shook his head back and forth. It never happened, according to him.",
      "He complained about that and other prosecution evidence. The fact that he and Monica used the encrypted apps WhatsApp and Viber to communicate between themselves, or that Monica shared her family's home security system's private log-in credentials with him. So what? he asked.",
      "I pointed out that while millions of Americans did use encrypted apps and accessed home security systems remotely, an objective person, say, a juror, might well find it suspicious that the lovers shared those prior to Fabio's murder. Baker remained indignant that those facts could be used against him or Monica.",
      "What about his Facebook messages with a friend where Baker said, \"No not yet living with her [Monica] but it's coming soon.\"\u00a0 Once again, Baker shrugged that off, \"just a conversation between friends.\" That explanation put the incredulous \"Huh?\" look on my face.",
      "\"Just a conversation between friends,\" he repeated with a shrug and a \"that's all\" expression. He just did not seem to get the prosecutor's point that a conversation between friends is precisely what was so revealing, and potentially incriminating \u00a0particularly because he murdered Fabio soon after.",
      "Robert Baker's sentence: Life without parole",
      "I turned the conversation to his sentencing hearing where numerous family members assailed him for taking away Fabio, a man so loved by two daughters, a son, two sisters and an immense family and circle of friends.",
      "\"Heartbreaking,\" he repeated a few times, \"heartbreaking.\" Baker had cried during the hearing, perhaps when Monica's daughters testified. What they may have seen as crocodile tears decidedly did not make an impression on the devastated family members and friends.",
      "I asked if that emotion at the hearing meant he wanted to apologize to Fabio's family. He offered nothing in reply just repeating, \"heartbreaking.\"\u00a0 \"I'm not the monster,\" he said, his voice trailing off before I could hear a finished thought.",
      "At that point, I had to interject, explaining that I had seen the autopsy report. Fabio had been viciously stabbed seven times, three separate wounds each deemed fatal as vital arteries were targeted. A beloved father, brother, son, friend, ambushed and slaughtered without a chance to defend himself.",
      "\"I know, I know,\" he said, dropping his head without meeting my eyes. He said only very recently had he seen the crime scene photos of Fabio \u2013 the gore and violence of the murder juxtaposed with the backdrop: Fabio's chair, where his family remembers him smoking cigars, \"Big Daddy\" baseball cap on his head, conducting business, and enjoying life in his favorite domain - the back patio.",
      "It was Fabio's then 16-year-old daughter who would find his body \u2013 too heavy as deadweight for her to even turn him over.",
      "Will Robert Baker testify?",
      "Earlier in our conversation, Baker conceded that he had recently been meeting with Monica's defense attorneys. Ostensibly, they are sizing Baker up for the possibility that he might testify at Monica's trial and drop that aforementioned bombshell on the jurors: that Monica was not involved, that she had no knowledge, that she never suspected her lover as the killer.",
      "Baker told me he does not know whether he will testify or not.",
      "I asked if he wanted to testify \"for her?\" For the second time, he took offense. \"I would not do it for her,\" he said. \"It would be to tell the truth.\"",
      "The idea that he might testify was heralded by her defense lawyers as a case closer.",
      "\"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine after Baker's sentencing.",
      "Legal experts that \"48 Hours\" spoke to were more circumspect. They acknowledged the power of that potential testimony. They also pointed out a jury might be skeptical after a withering cross-examination and an exploration of Baker's background. Baker's testimony represented a risky proposition, they reasoned \u2014 likely too risky.",
      "Background was a question Baker raised. I responded that I was aware of his acting experience in the industry \u2014 the porn industry. Baker nodded his approval at my research. It seemed odd, as if \u2014 like so many people that reporters deal with in Hollywood \u2014 Baker was asserting, 'I was an actor you know,'\u00a0rather than displaying unease with the courtroom optics of pornography.",
      "Our time was limited, so I chose not to raise his criminal background, a conviction for having sex with a minor, his teenage stepdaughter, who would marry him after his release from prison in the 1990s and enter the pornography world, doing movies with Baker. It seemed to be a tangent.",
      "Rather, I wanted to discuss the prosecution's claim that Monica was leading a double life after Fabio's murder.\u00a0 Prosecutors alleged she was expressing an outward appearance through social media that she was deeply in grief over the loss of her husband, while police simultaneously, surreptitiously documented a secretive, fun-filled romance with Baker \u2014 the killer.",
      "Baker chose not to shrug off this accusation, insisting that Monica's grief over Fabio's murder was intense and sincere. As validation, he offered that the two were no longer in contact and that she cursed him with her parting words, \"Murderer motherf*****,\" yelled across a hallway in lock up. He was alleging that once Monica learned Baker was the killer, she dropped him, but he did not say when.",
      "Another bombshell, the claim that their relationship was now over, as court documents had revealed 2017 love letters signed \"your wifey\u2026 Monica Baker 'til death,\" sent in jail. When a sheriff's deputy suddenly appeared, Baker turned and left, ending our interview abruptly.",
      "Outside I waited for my bus next to a sign that read \"Beware of Mountain Lions, Do Not Leave Children Unattended.\"\u00a0 Relishing the fresh, crisp, mountain air, I reflected on a lively, yet guarded, conversation that yielded glimpses of candor whether intentional or inadvertent from a murderer.",
      "On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, 53,\u00a0guilty of murder and conspiracy\u00a0for masterminding the murder of her husband Fabio, with special circumstances of murder for financial gain and murder while lying in wait. On June 23, 2025, Monica Sementilli was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She plans to appeal.",

      "Michelle Miller: How would you describe Rob Baker?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: He was cool. We all really liked him.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: He was one of those gym guys \u2014 you know, grrr!",
      "Bleuel played in his league.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: He was very alpha. He was a very alpha male. There was also kind of a sexual-ly thing about him.",
      "Michelle Miller: There was something sexual about him. What do you mean?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: You know how some guys just have just have this sexual kind of, I don't know, he was very manly \u2026 he was in shape, and he was kind of, you know, kept everything \u2014 he was in charge.",
      "He was also tangled up in the porn industry, even doing some acting.",
      "Bleuel didn't know much about Baker's background, but she did hear about his movie career from a friend who happened to spot him in an adult film.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: That's like the kind of gossip that \u2026 you just need to tell someone.",
      "Michelle Miller: Who did you tell?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: I told Monica.",
      "Monica was also in Robert Baker's racquetball league.",
      "Michelle Miller: What was her reaction?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: Well, it was pretty anticlimactic, I'll tell ya.",
      "Michelle Miller: Really?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: Yeah. 'cause a lotta times when we would have girl talk she'd get a little prude-y. \u00a0Like a little prude.",
      "What Bleuel didn't know was that Baker was also a registered sex offender.",
      "Capt. William Hayes: Robert Baker has a 1993 conviction out of a Long Beach case. It's for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.",
      "Police say Baker served time for that offense against a teenage girl.",
      "For months, police watched Baker and they discovered two things. First, he was definitely not one of the knock-knock burglars, and second, he made thousands of calls and texts to of all people, Monica Sementilli.",
      "In fact, just days after Fabio's death, Monica held a wake in her backyard and Baker actually showed up.",
      "Michelle Miller: You did meet him?",
      "Mirella Rota: I did.",
      "Rota says she saw Monica hanging out with Baker.",
      "Mirella Rota: I saw her back \u2026 outside again, with a drink, smoking, and talking to this guy. \u2026 I found out that that was his name, Rob. And she introduced me to him.",
      "Luigi noticed him, too.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: Robert and Monica were in the corner talking to each other, sort of away from the party.",
      "And there was something else Luigi noticed about Baker.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: He had bandages on his hands.",
      "One guest even snapped pictures of Monica and Robert Baker together. If you look closely, you can just make out a bandage on Baker's finger. Police would later conclude Baker cut that finger when he killed Fabio. And that's how his blood was at the scene.",
      "Detectives visited Monica at home using what they called a \"ruse\" \u2014 telling her they were investigating the knock-knock burglars, when in fact they were investigating her and secretly following Monica and Baker. And according to authorities, it paid off. They say they found evidence that Monica and Baker were having an affair and conspired to kill Fabio.",
      "JUSTIN EISENBERG | LAPD Chief of Detectives [to reporters in June 2017]: Over the past several months, investigators have developed information and identified Robert Baker, 55 years old of Canoga Park and Monica Sementilli, 45 years old, of Woodland Hills, who is the wife of our homicide victim, as responsible for his murder.",
      "Mirella Rota: He said, \"We arrested Monica for the murder of your brother, and Robert Baker for the murder of your brother.\" And I was in shock. I'm like, \"They're \u2014 you sure?\" You know? I \u2014 I was in shock.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution \u2026 these two were plotting and planning to kill Fabio so they could live their life together.",

      "Elyse Bleuel: My instant and thorough and complete reaction was there's no effing way \u2026 I was there. She was decimated.",
      "After months of crying and grieving alongside Monica, Fabio's family couldn't believe it either.",
      "Mirella Rota: Twenty-some years of my life she was like a sister. She was a cool aunt to my kids \u2026 she was loveable \u2026 my whole family felt that way about her (crying).",
      "Then, in 2023, Baker skipped trial altogether and pleaded no contest.",
      "Mary Fulginiti:\u00a0 Robert Baker pleads no contest.\u00a0 And that's in essence accepting responsibility for the murder. He's ultimately sentenced to life without parole.",
      "JUDGE RONALD COEN (in court): The maximum sentence in this case is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole plus one year. \u2026 You understand this?",

      "Julie Rendelman: The prosecution is so focused on the affair and wants, potentially a jury to say, because she had an affair, because she lied about an affair that you can take the leap to say that she conspired to kill her husband.",
      "She says Monica's relationship with Baker doesn't prove anything.",
      "But the prosecution says the affair is key to establishing a conspiracy between Monica and Robert Baker \u2014 an alleged conspiracy detectives spent months tracking.",

      "Mary Fulginiti: Five months. Five to six months.",
      "While the DA also declined an interview before going to trial, former prosecutor Mary Fulginiti reviewed the case against Monica.",

      "Mary Fulginiti: Yeah \u2026 You know, this is where the two joggers, you know, came according to the video from a neighbor, uh, running up here toward the house.",
      "Prosecutors say that first hooded figure \u2014 in the green sweatshirt\u2014 is Robert Baker.\u00a0 The second man was eventually identified as Christopher Austin \u2013 a close friend of Baker's.",
      "Michelle Miller: What does this indictment say about Monica Sementilli?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: This indictment is a very detailed outline and timeline of the plot to kill Fabio Sementilli.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Motive here is simple. I mean, this is love and money. This is one of the oldest crimes in the book where, you know, two lovers desperately wanting to be together, and they try to get rid of one of the spouses so they can be together for what? For financial benefit. \u2026 And that would mean the three quarters of a million life insurance policy, the house, 401ks.",
      "Police say the plan was to stage the scene to make it look like the work of the knock-knock burglars and throw police off their trail. And they believe Monica was deeply involved.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: They believe \u2026 she was the one that coordinated everything, the one that showed him, you know, where the house was, where the DVR was, so that he knew where to go to rip it out of the walls. How to get into the house.",
      "And that's not all. The prosecutor says six months before the murder, Monica forwarded an email sharing details of her home security system with Baker.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She provided the password, the username, the log in credentials, as well as the user manual to Robert Baker, the same day that she received it from the surveillance company.",
      "And then there's the day of the murder. Prosecutors say Monica's behavior that day is a key element of her role in the conspiracy to kill Fabio. According to prosecutors, surveillance video shows Monica left home at 3:26 p.m. driving the family's black Ford F-150 pickup.",
      "Michelle Miller (standing in a Target parking lot): This is where she came, according to prosecutors, to establish her alibi?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: So, a lot happens in this parking lot. \u2026 she pulls in here in her Ford-150 pickup truck right in front of this store \u2026 stops for just a few minutes.",
      "Prosecutors say they have video where it appears an individual gets into Monica's truck. They say that person was Robert Baker. Monica then goes alone into the Target store and begins shopping. But as she leaves, prosecutors say this surveillance photo shows her fixated on her phone.",
      "They would tell a grand jury it appears she was streaming video from her home \u2014 a lot of it.",
      "THE EVIDENCE AGAINST MONICA SEMENTILLI",
      "So what was Monica Sementilli watching on her phone that afternoon at about the time her husband was being murdered?",
      "Mary Fulginiti. The phone records and data show that she's connecting to a unique IP address. \u2026 It happens to be the IP address of the house. And there's a large amount of data that's being consumed. And that large amount of data is consistent with video streaming, i.e, the surveillance video of the house.",
      "Surveillance video? According to the DA, it might have been video from her home security cameras.",
      "But could Monica have been watching the actual murder?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: No\u2026 The surveillance cameras in the house are \u2014 are facing outside, but they're not facing in the pool area, which was where Fabio was located at the time. So, they didn't actually capture the murder, but they would capture obviously who was coming and going.",
      "Monica could have been watching everything else, prosecutors say.",
      "Mary Fulginiti (with Miller in the Target parking lot): They're going to argue \u2026 she's watching the scene, the scene of the crime to see the comings and goings of when Baker and the accomplice are going into the house, when are they leaving the house so that she knows when she can leave here and go home.",
      "Prosecutors say while she is watching the feed, Baker and his accomplice were on the Sementilli property stalking Fabio.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution, \"it was a very targeted attack that was done with the intent to kill.\" They also go on to say that \"he was stabbed in the neck, it cut his jugular vein, cut the carotid artery.\"",
      "And there's more evidence of the plot to kill Fabio. Prosecutors say Baker was planning a future with Monica.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: The DA says that about two months before the murder, Baker told a friend that he had been dating this woman for about a year, and that he sent a picture of that woman, and that woman was Monica.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And then two months later Fabio was killed.",
      "Authorities also say Monica's behavior after the murder is suspect. She didn't move her teenage daughters out of the house or have her security system repaired.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And the prosecutors argued that the reason why she had no concern, because she knew who the killer was, and she was with him.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: This is a woman who is pretending to be a grieving widow and making all these posts on social media.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Who at the same time is carrying on a torrid love affair with the man who actually killed her husband.",
      "Prosecutors made explicit photos public in court filings. Some we can't show you. They say its evidence the secretive romance continued after Fabio's death.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: I mean, that's a double life. \u2026 The D.A. presented a photograph of Monica and \u2014 and Baker to the grand jury. And it was a photograph of Monica actually grabbing his crotch. \u2026 And this was one, uh, that was taken in Vegas.",
      "Michelle Miller: There was also this \u2014 this photo of a mirror.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Right. \u2026 it was a photo of the back of Monica \u2026 with Mrs. Baker, uh, written lipstick on the mirror.",
      "Michelle Miller: The \u2026 lipstick and the mirror \u2026 What \u2014 what does that tell them?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Again, this all goes to motive. I mean, Mrs. Baker \u2026 she wanted to be Mrs. Baker.",
      "But when detectives asked Monica about Robert Baker, prosecutors say she told them she wasn't even sure of his last name. They say she also told them she wasn't sure how to work the home security cameras.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: To quote the prosecution here, they say, \"She's a liar, she's a manipulator, she's a cheater. And everything that comes out of her mouth has to be taken with a large grain of salt large enough so that you could choke on it.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: If they can show that Monica lied about her lifestyle, about the affair, about a variety of other things, that they'll convince the jury that she's also lying about her involvement in this conspiracy to kill Fabio.",
      "And they say when she was later confronted about why Baker's blood was found in her house, she continued to lie.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She comes up with some cockamamie story about, you know, playing racquetball with Baker and hitting him in the finger and that it was bleeding and there was a bloody towel and she had to bring it home and \u2014 and that's why his blood was at the house.",
      "But Fulginiti says one of the biggest pieces of evidence against Monica is what happened when police came up with a plan to secretly record the couple. It began when they pulled them over as they were driving.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: It's a ruse by the police. \u2026 They say that they think the car that they're in is stolen and they wanted to, you know, just check it out and you know, probably isn't and they handcuff them per protocol, put them into the police vehicle. But what they don't know is that vehicle's wired and that there's a van up the street with police in it listening to their every word. And it's at that point, Monica says, and I'm gonna quote here: \"Somebody must have talked. Somebody is doing this to us.\" And then she said, \"They must have something. They must have something.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: That's pretty damning evidence. \u2026 as a former prosecutor that is close to an admission to being involved in this conspiracy.",
      "According to detectives, Monica was also recorded telling her cellmate, \"He's not just my lover \u2026 he's my confidante \u2026 he's my everything.\"",
      "Detectives also intercepted letters Monica wrote to Baker from behind bars saying, \"I'm always amazed how we both know what the other is thinking. DESTINED!\" And \"I miss you so much my love!\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: When you look at these pieces in the totality, it's going to put together a pretty perfect puzzle here. And the puzzle will paint this picture that Monica conspired with Baker, that he did not do it alone, that they did it together.",
      "But Monica's defenders say the case against her is flimsy, and they say Baker did it without her.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Robert Baker may have killed him because he wanted him out of the way. Maybe he did it because he hoped that by killing him, he would get Monica to himself. \u2026 That in and of itself does not establish that Monica was in on the murder.",
      "DEFENDING MONICA SEMENTILLI",
      "Monica Sementilli's defense is adamant she had absolutely nothing to do with Fabio's murder.",
      "Julie Rendelman: The defense's position is that there is no evidence that establishes Monica Sementilli participated in conspiracy.",
      "And if you can't prove a conspiracy, you can't prove Monica's guilt says Rendelman.",
      "Michelle Miller: The sheer number of circumstances that seem to weave together\u2014 the parking lot meeting \u2026 the walking into the store and watching video that has streamed live from the home \u2026 the password being given to the killer \u2026 all of those things, the sum of them, wouldn't a jury believe is just too much of a coincidence?",
      "Julie Rendelman: Obviously, I can't answer for what the jury is gonna say. Um, the defense, I could promise you, is going to attempt to poke holes \u2014 holes in every single piece of evidence you just spoke about.",
      "Michelle Miller: So, let's go step-by-step \u2026 the sharing of that password for the surveillance video.",
      "Julie Rendelman: So, there is no question that she shared the password.",
      "But Rendelman says there's no connection between sharing that password and a murder plot.",
      "Julie Rendelman: There's absolutely no evidence between the six months that she shared it and the day he was killed, that establishes there was any plan in place between them whatsoever to have her husband killed, not a text, not an email, not a conversation with her best friend saying she's over her relationship.",
      "Julie Rendelman: The second issue is, there's absolutely no evidence that Robert Baker downloaded the app or ever even used the app.",
      "Michelle Miller: Let's talk about the actions in the parking lot the day of the murder. \u2026 someone appears to be getting into the car.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Keep a couple things in mind. One is from the defense's perspective \u2026 the video footage is so grainy that you can't make out who if anybody is getting into Monica Sementilli's car.",
      "And what about the allegation that she was watching video of the house as the murder took place?",
      "Michelle Miller: Once she went inside the Target \u2014 there was a point in time where she seemed fascinated, fixated on her phone.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Well, I'll tell you one thing. The prosecution doesn't know what she was watching on her phone. They cannot articulate nor will they ever be able to articulate what was going on in that phone.",
      "Michelle Miller: But it was being streamed from her home.",
      "Julie Rendelman: She could be watching a show, just like any one of us watched your show while we're walking along.",
      "Michelle Miller: The prosecution really digs in on Monica's character, the fact that she's having an affair.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Well, let me quote what the defense says in \u2014in regards to that. \"The prosecutor's evidence of Ms. Sementilli's affair and specifically the sexist and lurid manner in which it was presented \u2026 was irrelevant, improper and unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Sementilli.\"",
      "Julie Rendelman: They go on and say, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question, whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\"",
      "But then why lie to investigators \u2014 allegedly saying she was unsure of Robert Baker's last name?",
      "Julie Rendelman: The question becomes, why is she lying? Is she lying because she committed a murder or is she lying because she has been in a tryst with someone for quite a while and doesn't want the world to know particularly, law enforcement?",
      "Prosecutors did find it suspicious that on the night Fabio died, Monica was already inquiring about his life insurance. But Rendelman says it's not odd.",
      "Julie Rendelman: I understand, um, how it could look insensitive to start asking about a life insurance policy so soon after. But if you're, uh, an individual that is not financially sound, you have two girls at home, you have potentially a mortgage to pay, you have bills to pay, you are going to be worried about the financial security of your family.",
      "In January 2025, Monica went on trial for the murder of her husband.",
      "And prosecutor Beth Silverman's star witness? That second hooded figure in the surveillance video, Christopher Austin.\u00a0 Austin cut a deal. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree murder which potentially means a lighter prison sentence and, in exchange, agreed to testify truthfully at Monica's trial. \u00a0Austin told the jury, that prior to the murder, he knew Monica wanted Fabio dead.",
      "CHRISTOPHER AUSTIN (in court): Baker told me ... she wants him gone.",
      "On the day of Fabio's murder, Austin testified that it was Monica who was directing Robert Baker via text messages to kill her husband. He even explained how he and Baker got into the Sementilli house.",
      "CHRISTOPHER AUSTIN (in court): He told me, he said, \"She \u2014 she's gonna leave the door unlocked.\"",
      "And he also said that Monica alerted Baker to let him know Fabio was home alone. But Monica's defense claims Austin only brought up Monica's name to get that deal. And Austin admits he never personally spoke to Monica or heard Baker speaking with her.\u00a0 Still he insisted Monica was in charge.",
      "CHRISTOPHER AUSTIN (in court): \u2026 he was talking to her via text message. ... everything that happened in sequence was after he talked to her.",
      "But Robert Baker would tell a very different story.\u00a0 Baker took the stand and said it was him, not Monica, who wanted Fabio dead.\u00a0 Monica, he claims, had no knowledge he planned to kill Fabio.",
      "ROB BAKER (in court): I murdered him because I wanted her. ... I wanted her to be around me and with me more like all the time.",
      "Another factor that could help Monica, says Rendelman \u2014 the daughters she shared with Fabio supported their mother and testified.",
      "Julie Rendelman: And so, there's an argument to be made that the jury is looking at the daughter saying, \"if they believe her after all this, shouldn't we?\"",
      "In closing arguments, Monica's defense attorney Leonard Levine would tell the jury the only thing Monica is guilty of was having an affair.",
      "LEONARD LEVINE (in court): Adultery is not murder. ... She was obsessed with her family not finding out \u2014 with anybody not finding out ... Not because she was part of the murder, but because she was having an affair.",
      "The jury deliberated for over three days before they came to a verdict: guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. After eight long years, it was the verdict Fabio's sister Mirella was waiting for.",
      "Mirella Rota: Justice was served today. It is the most beautiful day for our family. Our spirits are lifted. My brother can now rest in peace. And the murderers that have deceived him are exactly where they belong today.",
      "Christopher Austin was sentenced to 16 years-to-life for his role in Fabio Sementilli's murder.",
      "On June 23, 2025, Monica Sementilli was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \u00a0She plans to appeal.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 19:20:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will remain detained after a jury found him guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his high-profile trial in New York City. The music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he denied bail for Combs because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs was convicted of two counts of prostitution-related charges. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.",
      "Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said Wednesday, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "After leaving court, Combs' attorney declined to comment on the bail denial, saying \"a lot of these things are still in process.\"",
      "\"We are not nearly done fighting,\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters outside U.S. district court in lower Manhattan. \"Today was a major major step in the right direction, but we fight on and we're gonna win, and we're not gonna stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.\"",
      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend Jane, the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he was held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",
      "The attorneys cited conditions under the Bail Reform Act that states \"a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense is entitled to release pending sentencing if the Court finds by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he 'is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.'\"",
      "Federal prosecutors, however, argued the Bail Reform Act dictates that Combs should remain in custody.",
      "In their filing to the judge, prosecutors said the crimes Combs was convicted of \"constitute crimes of violence and mandate detention following the defendant's conviction.\"",
      "\"As detention is mandatory following a conviction of a Mann Act offense, the Government has been unable to locate a case in which a defendant was released from custody following such a conviction,\" prosecutors said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bryan-kohberger-university-of-idaho-student-murders-plea-hearing/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 19:18:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Bryan Kohberger admitted to the murders in Idaho and entered a formal guilty plea in a deal with prosecutors that will allow him to avoid the death penalty.",
    "story": [
      "Bryan Kohberger, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders of four University of Idaho students in 2022, admitted to the crimes in court Wednesday before formally entering a guilty plea in a\u00a0deal that spares him\u00a0from the death penalty.",
      "As part of the plea deal, Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the stabbings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed at a home in Moscow, Idaho, during the\u00a0early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. He was also charged with one count of burglary. Kohberger was arrested at his\u00a0parents' home in Pennsylvania\u00a0six weeks later.",
      "The hearing began just before 11:15 a.m. local time. Judge Steven Hippler asked that those in the courtroom avoid \"outbursts or demonstrations\" during the hearing. Hippler apologized for the short notice for the hearing, and said he did not know about a plea agreement before Monday.",
      "Kohberger faces up to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, one for each murder charge, and a 10-year sentence for the burglary charge. Hippler said that the court is not bound by the plea agreement as far as sentencing, and could impose a different sentence, but Kohberger is unable to ask the court to do so. He would also waive his right to appeal, Hippler said. The plea deal would spare him the death penalty, which prosecutors had sought.",
      "Kohberger told Hippler he agreed with the plea agreement and understood the nature of the charges against him. He said he had not been coerced into taking the plea agreement.",
      "\"Are you pleading guilty because you are guilty?\" Hippler asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" Kohberger said.",
      "Hippler then asked Kohberger if he had murdered Mogen, Goncalves, Kernodle and Chapin. Kohberger said \"Yes\" to each question. Family members of the victims could be seen crying in the courtroom as Hippler read the charges against Kohberger.",
      "The plea deal was first revealed in a letter sent to the victims' families by the Latah County Prosecutor's Office. Mogen's father, Ben Mogen, shared portions of the letter with \"CBS Mornings,\" in which the prosecutor's office said that attorneys for Kohberger, 30, requested the deal and Kohberger accepted it.",
      "Prosecutors then outlined the evidence they would have brought against Kohberger if the case had gone to trial. Their evidence would have included\u00a0DNA evidence\u00a0that linked him to a knife sheath found at the crime scene. Kohberger had bought the same type of a\u00a0knife with the same type of sheath on Amazon, prosecutors said. The DNA came from a single male source, prosecutors said, and was later matched to Kohberger. The weapon itself has not been recovered, prosecutors said. They also\u00a0planned\u00a0to present surveillance video of Kohberger's car and cellphone data that they said showed him in the vicinity of the killings.",
      "Finally, Hippler asked Kohberger how he pled to each charge. To each count, Kohberger pleaded guilty.",
      "Kohberger's sentencing was set for July 23. The sentencing is expected to take one day, and victim impact statements will be read then.",
      "Kohberger's trial was expected to begin in August, following several delays.",
      "Kohberger's defense team had a motion to remove the death penalty as a possible sentence if he was convicted denied in November 2024. The case was meant to be tried in Latah County, but was moved to Boise out of concerns that media coverage and statements from local officials would make it impossible for Kohberger to receive a fair trial.",
      "Most recently, Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied a motion by Kohberger's lawyers, who were seeking to argue that four \"alternate perpetrators\" could have committed the slayings. The judge called the argument \"rank speculation\" and said nothing linked the parties to the murders.",
      "Martin Souto Diaz, an attorney for the Kohberger family, said in a statement provided to CBS News Tuesday evening on behalf of the family that, \"In light of recent developments, the Kohbergers are asking members of the media for privacy, respect, and responsible judgment during this time. We will continue to allow the legal process to unfold with respect to all parties, and will not release any comments or take any questions.\"",
      "Legal experts weigh in on Kohberger plea deal",
      "Gretchen Engel, the executive director of the Center for Death Penalty Litigation who has spent 33 years representing death row prisoners, said that in her experience it's \"pretty common for a plea deal to come together at the last minute.\"",
      "However, she said she is \"a bit mystified\" prosecutors in this case agreed to a deal just a month before trial. One reason could be that there's a weakness in the case, she said.",
      "CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi said the state of Idaho will benefit from the plea deal, especially since Kohberger will not be able to appeal. That may also offer relief to the families, she said.",
      "\"They're getting a conviction right away, they're getting the absolute guarantee of life behind bars without the possibility of parole,\" Polisi said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday. \"It costs way more money to have a capital case to impose the death penalty than it does to have somebody serve life behind bars, and so, part of the rationale that the state of Idaho or prosecutors said was we're saving these families decades potentially of the anguish of going through this appeals process. This would not be a quick process.\"",
      "The plea deal also allows the state to save \"judicial resources,\" Polisi said, and avoids the uncertainty of a trial and sentencing.",
      "\"This is a slam-dunk case by all accounts \u2026 the DNA evidence on the knife sheath in particular, I mean, there's so much evidence here,\" she said. \"But trials, there's always a wildcard, right? There's always a chance that there wouldn't be a conviction, and then the death penalty isn't necessarily a sure thing either.\"",
      "However, the lack of a trial means that some questions may remain unanswered, Polisi said.",
      "\"We may never know the motive or the exact way that this crime took place, which I think is frustrating for the families as well,\" she said.",
      "Families of victims react",
      "The families of the victims have been split on the plea deal. The Goncalves family said in a statement shared on Facebook that they are \"beyond furious at the State of Idaho,\" and said officials had \"failed\" them.",
      "\"This was very unexpected,\" the family wrote. In another statement, they asked that the plea deal \"require a full confession, full accountability, location of the murder weapon, confirmation the defendant acted alone, & the true facts of what happened that night.\"",
      "Ben Mogen said he was relieved to get the letter, and said the plea deal will spare him and his family from more time in court.",
      "\"We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don't want to have to be at, that we shouldn't have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We get to just think about the rest of our lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and without the rest of the kids.\"",

    "story": [
      "Editor's note: On June 20, 2025, the husband of Colorado mom Suzanne Morphew was arrested for first-degree murder in her death more than five years ago. This is the second time Barry Morphew has faced murder charges in connection with her homicide after the initial charges were dismissed.",
      "The death of the 49-year-old Colorado mother who went missing was officially declared a homicide, according to an autopsy report released on April 29, 2024. This revelation came two years after prosecutors dropped murder charges against her husband just as he was about to stand trial.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's remains were found\u00a0during a search on Sept. 22, 2023, and positively identified by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation on Sept. 27, 2023. She was last seen on Mother's Day, May 10, 2020.",
      "[This story previously aired on April 30, 2022. It was updated on July 1, 2023.]",
      "This past week, a prosecutor working on the case of Suzanne Morphew, a missing mother of two, said in open court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body. \"She is in a very difficult spot,\" said Deputy District Attorney Mark Hurlbert. \"We actually have more than just a feeling \u2026 and the sheriff's office is continuing to look for Mrs. Morphew's body.\"",
      "It was a major update in the Morphew case which began on Mother's Day 2020, when she disappeared from her Colorado home. Hurlbert said there was no timetable for bringing a murder case to trial. \"That could be a long time. It could be quick, it could be long. It depends on a lot of our investigation,\" he said.",
      "When Suzanne first went missing, investigators compiled and followed several bizarre clues\u2014a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen\u2014but lacked direct evidence.",
      "Investigators noticed Barry's cell phone appeared to be pinging all around his house on Mother's Day weekend 2020, which he maintains was because he was chasing and shooting at chipmunks. Investigators also found a plastic cap for a syringe that they believe was used to load a tranquilizer dart in the couple's dryer. Barry, investigators say, told them he didn't know how the cap got there, but admitted he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. The cap, however, did not contain any of Barry's DNA.",
      "Investigators also found a spy pen right out of a James Bond movie that was able to capture and record conversations. The pen captured several intimate conversations between Suzanne and a secret lover. Investigators also uncovered DNA on the glovebox of Suzanne's Range Rover, which traced back to an unknown male connected to three sexual assaults.",
      "MISSING ON MOTHER'S DAY",
      "Dan Ridenour [riding in car with Peter Van Sant]: What happened on this road is a real mystery. No one knows. Where is Suzanne?",
      "In the days, weeks and months after Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020, her trail went cold, but the mother of two's disappearance had become the biggest story in Colorado.",
      "ANDREW MOORMAN [talking to searchers, CBS Denver news report]:\u00a0We're gonna fan out and were gonna work that area very carefully, OK?",
      "Four months in, Suzanne's brother, Andrew Moorman, organized a citizen's search. He said he felt he had to do something \u2014 anything.",
      "ANDREW MOORMAN [to CBS Denver]: I hope to find her alive and at some point, you have to realize when somebody's been missing after so long, that the chances of that diminish dramatically.",
      "The thought that Suzanne may have been abducted hit the peaceful, picturesque town of Salida hard.",
      "Dan Ridenour: I came home every day and my wife asked me, \"had they found her yet?\"",
      "Dan Ridenour has covered the story for his local morning show.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry and Suzanne Morphew were not known well in Salida, Colorado \u2026They had only been here for a couple of years.",
      "Before moving to Colorado in 2018, Barry and Suzanne grew up in the small town of Alexandria, Indiana, where they met in high school. Suzanne competed for homecoming queen. Barry was a star baseball player who was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays. Injury ended Barry's dreams of a major league career. They both attended Purdue University and married in 1994. He started a landscaping business. Suzanne taught middle school before becoming a full-time mother.",
      "Dan Ridenour: They had a couple of daughters \u2026 one in college \u2026 And they had a daughter in high school \u2026",
      "Macy, 16 years old when her mom disappeared, lived at home. Her sister Mallory attended college and the Morphews told some friends they moved to a home just outside of Salida to be closer to their older daughter. But there were also rumblings about the state of the Morphew's marriage.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Maybe a new place, a new \u2014 home, new scenery around them \u2026 would strengthen their family and therefore strengthen their marriage.",
      "But the move did not appear to improve the relationship. It was a tough time, says her sister Melinda Moorman.",
      "Melinda Moorman: My sister had sent me a text message \u2026 It was very lengthy. It was very powerful. It was very revealing.",
      "In a Zoom interview, Melinda said she received Suzanne's text two days before she disappeared, and it was boiling over with anger toward Barry.",
      "The text read in part: \"He's also been abusive emotionally and physically\u2026 I feel more angry now. Anger at what I've allowed.\"",
      "Melinda Moorman: Barry was very dominant in the relationship, and my sister was a very passive, gentle soul \u2026 he had \u2026 a great tendency to overpower, intimidate people to get what he wanted.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what kinda boss was he?",
      "Cody Cox: You know, he was real quiet \u2026 stern \u2026 He knew what he was doin', 'cause that's what he did in Indiana.",
      "Cody Cox was part of Barry's landscaping crew for nearly two years when Barry first arrived in Colorado.",
      "Cody Cox: I talked pretty highly about Barry 'cause I was with him all the time. And he's like, an inspiration to me almost \u2026 he was a real cool guy.",
      "Cody said he regularly heard Barry talking to Suzanne as they drove in Barry's truck.",
      "Cody Cox: : \u2026 they seemed to communicate pretty well. Like I said, I could hear almost every phone call he had.",
      "And he says he met Suzanne a handful of times; she even made cookies for his wife and kids.",
      "Cody Cox: She was a sweetheart. She was a real kind lady \u2026 She's almost like an angel, like somethin' you'd see off a Hallmark movie, you know \u2026 real nice, almost too perfect.",
      "Cody Cox: So, when I heard about the news, I didn't believe it \u2026 I heard it actually on the radio. And I was like, \"Did they just say Suzanne?\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh. Who'd even wanna hurt her?\"",
      "The first day authorities searched for Suzanne, they found her mountain bike close to the Morphew home.",
      "Peter Van Sant [at ravine]: Where was the mountain bike found?",
      "Dan Ridenour [pointing]: It was found right over this little cliff right here resting on these boulders.",
      "Dan Ridenour: She was new at mountain biking. So, an accident is certainly plausible. I would only ask, \"Where's Suzanne?\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: She would have been injured, yeah?",
      "Dan Ridenour: She would have been injured.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Was there clothing found down here?",
      "Dan Ridenour: No.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Was her helmet found down here?",
      "Dan Ridenour: No.",
      "Investigators believe the scene was staged and, days later, they discovered Suzanne's helmet roughly a mile away off Highway 50.",
      "Dan Ridenour [riding in car]: The helmet was found on the south side of the road.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, this side of the road?",
      "Dan Ridenour: Which would be to our left.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, is the thought somebody threw it out of a window, perhaps?",
      "Dan Ridenour: That's the thinking, yes \u2026",
      "It appeared as though Suzanne could have been abducted, and that's when Barry made a videotaped public plea on social media. In those early days, Barry had a theory about what happened to Suzanne that he shared with Tyson Draper who has his own YouTube channel.",
      "BARRY MORPHEW: Where are you from?",
      "TYSON DRAPER: I'm from Arizona.",
      "BARRY MORPHEW: OK.",
      "BARRY MORPHEW: Let me tell you what happened.",
      "TYSON DRAPER: OK.",
      "They happened to meet at the site where Suzanne's mountain bike was found and Tyson secretly videotaped Barry:",
      "BARRY MORPHEW [to Draper]: The first night there was a mountain lion that officers seen that walked by the car. So, we thought that maybe she got attacked by a lion.",
      "A mountain lion killed her?",
      "Dan Ridenour: If that happened, there would have been signs of that \u2026 There would've been blood, there would've been a struggle \u2026 So, that was a very short-lived speculation.",
      "Authorities began to doubt that Suzanne even took a bike ride, especially after her sunglasses and hydration backpack were found in her car.\u00a0 Investigators also found her driver's license and credit cards in her Range Rover. But her cell phone was missing.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did Barry Morphew cooperate with investigators during the course of this?",
      "Ashley Franco: He had been interviewed by investigators through the course of it and he talked to investigators almost every time.",
      "Ashley Franco, who reported on the case for the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, KKTV, has read the police documents and she says Barry has repeatedly told the same story. He came home around 3 p.m. on May 9, 2020 and had a pleasant evening with Suzanne. The next morning, Mother's Day, Barry says he drove to a job some 3 hours away.",
      "Ashley Franco: He says the last time he sees his wife is when she's sleeping in their bed.",
      "As investigators began trying to verify Barry's alibi, they were pulled in a new direction. Suzanne's spy pen had surfaced with that intimate conversation. Now they needed to figure out the identity of \"Jeff,\" Suzanne's lover.",
      "Ashley Franco: Could this man have had something to do with Suzanne's disappearance?",
      "SUZANNE'S SECRET LOVER IDENTIFIED",
      "It was just days after Suzanne Morphew went missing when investigators make that intriguing discovery.",
      "Aya Gruber: They discover a spy pen.",
      "Peter Van Sant: A spy pen?",
      "Peter Van Sant: A spy pen.",
      "Aya Gruber is a law professor and a former defense attorney.\u00a0 She has closely studied all the public investigative files in the Morphew case; she knows it was not easy for investigators to find Suzanne's secret lover: a man named \"Jeff.\"",
      "Aya Gruber: She hid that affair so well that it took \u2026 agents six months to find the man she was having an affair with.",
      "\"Jeff\" turned out to be Jeff Libler and he had a wife and six children in Michigan where he lived. He and Suzanne had a one-time fling after high school. Decades passed until Suzanne reached out to Jeff, out of the blue, in 2018.",
      "Ashley Franco: When Suzanne and Barry moved to Colorado, Suzanne messaged him on Facebook.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what did she message him?",
      "Ashley Franco: \"Howdy Stranger.\" \u2026 And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop.",
      "In the months after Suzanne went missing, Jeff kept quiet.\u00a0 He only began cooperating after he was located by investigators, who learned Jeff had taken steps to hide the nearly two-year affair.",
      "Aya Gruber: What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne. \u2026 He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.",
      "Jeff told agents he only took those steps because he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory and worried he might lose his family and job. He was also worried agents considered him a suspect.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 he asks the agents, \"Am I a target?\"",
      "Although he did not come forward on his own, Jeff did assist agents after they found him. He agreed to provide access to his DNA, phone records and his passwords for those deleted accounts. By looking through the couple's iCloud accounts and phone records, agents were able to piece together their relationship, including the times they met in person.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators also found that Suzanne, on several instances, had gone on vacation to meet up with Jeff in many different states, ranging from Louisiana to Florida.",
      "Investigators also discovered they'd sent intimate photos to each other, talked of becoming husband and wife, and even mentioned leaving the United States.",
      "Ashley Franco: Jeff and Suzanne had talked about moving away \u2026 moving to Ecuador at one point \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: If you were an investigator instead of a law professor, what would you wanna know about this Jeff Libler?",
      "Aya Gruber: Everything. I'd wanna know everything about what he was doing, what he was thinking. \u2026 Here is somebody who arguably had the last communication \u2026 with Suzanne before she went missing.",
      "The love affair between Suzanne and Jeff became a key part of the investigation as agents tried to figure out what happened to her on that Saturday, May 9, the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Records show that Suzanne and Jeff messaged each other 59 times that day, much more than usual, authorities say.",
      "At one point, Suzanne sends Jeff a selfie. Investigators dub it her last \"proof of life\" photo. Barry was not home, as the lovers' texts heat up:",
      "At 2:05 p.m., Suzanne writes: \"I'm just in love with you. Whatcha up to?\"",
      "Jeff's response at 2:06 p.m. was: \"Want to strip down and get naked? LOL??\"",
      "She responds by saying she'll \"load up\" her WhatsApp account and then at 2:11 p.m., Suzanne writes, \"Okay I'm on WA\".",
      "Then, at 2:26 p.m., Suzanne gets a text from Barry that he's heading home. \"Done headed back.\"",
      "No one knows if Suzanne saw that text or was preoccupied with Jeff, but she does not answer.",
      "Barry follows up, appearing to wonder where Suzanne is. \"Did you leave?\"",
      "There was still no response from Suzanne and investigators speculate the next few moments are when Barry returned home. They notice that Barry's cell phone appears to be pinging all around the outside of his house. Was he chasing Suzanne before a final and fatal confrontation?",
      "Investigators asked Barry to explain that unusual phone activity.",
      "Aya Gruber: And he says, \"Well, lemme think about that. I was probably walking around my house shooting chipmunks.\"",
      "You heard right \u2014 it was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi.\u00a0 Barry says the chipmunks were a constant nuisance at his house and he'd been running around shooting them that day.",
      "Aya Gruber: And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him.",
      "There was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around Barry's house. Part of his problem, Aya says, is that Barry granted between 30 and 40 interviews \u2014 all without a lawyer \u2014 to everyone from a county detective to members of the FBI.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Would you have allowed him to do all these interviews?",
      "Aya Gruber: No. Absolutely not.",
      "Meanwhile, Jeff Libler was cleared. He told agents he was in Michigan that weekend and his alibi checked out. When investigators tell Barry of the affair, he denies knowing anything about it.",
      "But if Barry knew nothing about Suzanne's affair, what motive would he have to kill her? One clue may be a deleted text that investigators found on Barry's phone sent by Suzanne just days before: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "Dan Ridenour: So, the only thing that makes sense is that Barry Morphew lost it when Suzanne finally said, \"I'm leaving you.\"",
      "Barry knew that his daughters would be away on their camping trip that Saturday afternoon and authorities say he took advantage of that opportunity to kill Suzanne and clean up the crime scene.",
      "Peter Van Sant: From 2:47 p.m. until 10:17 p.m., just under 8 hours, Barry's phone goes into airplane mode. What do authorities believe happened during that time?",
      "Ashley Franco: Authorities say that they believe, when his phone went into airplane mode, that he was disposing of possible evidence.",
      "Unable to track Barry's cell phone, investigators tapped into a relatively new investigative technique \u2014 digital vehicle forensics \u2014 to pull a stream of data out of Barry's Ford truck. And Barry's truck told a different story than what he was telling investigators.",
      "Ashley Franco: They were using Barry's own car against him.",
      "IF A TRUCK COULD TALK \u2014  \u00a0IN THIS CASE, IT DID",
      "Ben LeMere is an expert in the new field of vehicle forensics.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Give me a sense of how your technology, from your company, helps solve criminal cases.",
      "Ben LeMere: So, a lotta times it's used to \u2026 locate bodies.",
      "LeMere is the CEO of the Berla Corporation.",
      "Ben LeMere: It helps \u2026 get people convicted. It's helped get people not convicted.",
      "Investigators from Scotland Yard to the FBI have learned how to use Berla's software to tap into the dozens of computers in a car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's accurate enough to be used as evidence in court cases, correct?",
      "Ben LeMere: Yes, sir.",
      "Cases like the disappearance of Suzanne Morphew. Investigators created a Berla report, meaning they tapped into the data in Barry's Ford truck to track its movements after his cell phone went into airplane mode.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 a couple of the pieces of evidence that I think are very harmful to his case \u2014 come from the data in the car \u2026",
      "Ashley Franco: The prosecution's case is that Barry snapped at one point the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Authorities believe Barry killed Suzanne that afternoon. He told agents he went to bed around 8 p.m. that night, but the data pulled from the truck shows that the truck was put in reverse and moved some 96 feet closer to his house around 9:30 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators think that's when he could have loaded Suzanne's body.",
      "Initially, Barry told police that he set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. on Mother's Day and left the house by 5 a.m. to drive to a job site in Broomfield, a town near Denver, 150 miles from Salida. But the truck's computers show that someone was opening and closing the truck's doors around 3:30 a.m.",
      "Investigators believe Barry began driving toward Broomfield much earlier than he claimed, but there is a 4-hour window\u2014approximately 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.\u2014when no activity was recorded by the vehicle's computers.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 there are events in the car \u2014 that aren't recorded. So, they can't give sort of a full chronological picture.",
      "And if Barry hid Suzanne's body during that 4-hour window, the truck's data does not provide answers.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Why is data missing sometimes?",
      "Ben Lemere: Well, it gets overwritten. You know, it is a computer \u2026 Log files, they only last so long.",
      "But Barry helped fill in some of the missing data. He told agents he took a left upon leaving his home instead of a right because, even though it was dark, he remembered seeing some elk.",
      "Ashley Franco: He saw a herd of elk, and he's a hunter. So, he was interested, and he wanted to get an up-close look.",
      "That admission was significant to agents because it put him in an area where a key piece of evidence had been recovered.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators found Suzanne's bike helmet up that road. So, they believe, at that point when he turned left instead of turning right, that he could have been ditching her bike helmet.",
      "At 8:10 a.m. on Mother's Day morning, the truck's computers again begin recording data. And by then, Barry's cell phone had also come back to life. Agents are able to track Barry's cell and truck movements and can see that he first pulled over at a Broomfield bus stop where he discarded something in a garbage can.",
      "Ashley Franco: And then he moves on to a hotel trash can, a McDonald's trash can \u2026 a dumpster \u2026 in a Men's Wearhouse parking lot, and then back to the hotel, and dumps stuff in a dumpster there. Investigators believe that during these \"trash runs,\" he was disposing of evidence in different places within the Denver area.",
      "In a surveillance shot of Barry on one of those trash runs, investigators could not see what he was throwing away. It may have looked incriminating, but Barry claims it was just another day at the office. He told agents he was merely being cheap, not criminal.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And his claim, well, I just always have a lotta junk in \u2014 in the vehicle. I don't like to pay to have it \u2014 disposed at a landfill, I \u2014 this is just what I do.",
      "Ashley Franco: But it's suspicious that you would go to five different trash areas to dispose of several things. Why not just do it at one?",
      "After checking out the work site, Barry headed back to his room at the Holiday Inn, and investigators say he stayed there from 12:42 p.m. to 6:03 p.m. By then, he'd already spoken to older daughter Mallory who told him she could not get in touch with her mother.",
      "That's when the Morphew neighbors were contacted and could find no sign of Suzanne.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry asked them at that time if the bike was there, to go check on her \u2026 her bicycle is not here.",
      "Barry asks his neighbor to call 911.",
      "Dan Ridenour: And that's when the call to 911 \u2026 was placed, that Suzanne is missing.",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry doesn't head home immediately, and he is dropping some tools off for his coworkers.",
      "Tools including a shovel. With Suzanne now officially reported missing, Barry tells his workers there's a family emergency and arranges hotel rooms with one of those workers taking over Barry's room.",
      "Ashley Franco: When the employee was interviewed, he told investigators that \u2026 the room that Barry checked out of, it had a strong smell of chlorine or bleach.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Which suggests what?",
      "Ashley Franco: That he could be cleaning up a crime scene.",
      "Just after 6 p.m., Barry starts driving back to Salida. On the way, Barry speaks to sheriff deputies who advise him they've found Suzanne's bike and he arrives at that ravine at around 8:40 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: And investigators say that when he arrived there, he was pretty emotional for a few minutes.",
      "By Sunday night, Suzanne's daughters were back home but Suzanne is nowhere to be found. Barry offered a $100,000 reward for information that was later doubled to $200,000.",
      "Investigators later discovered many texts from Suzanne to a close friend that apparently revealed her tormented feelings about Barry:",
      "\"He won't speak of divorce \u2026\"",
      "\"I feel no peace when he's here \u2026\"",
      "\"I wouldn't feel safe alone with him \u2026\"",
      "Barry became the prime suspect and investigators think they know how he killed Suzanne.",
      "DID BARRY TARGET SUZANNE?",
      "While investigators searched the Morphew home and the family's cars and trucks, Barry continued to talk, seemingly to anyone with a badge. Weeks and months went by and Barry remained at the center of the investigation.",
      "Aya\u00a0Gruber: \u2026 police are absolutely correct as a statistical matter to look at intimate partners \u2026 when they suspect that a woman might've been harmed or murdered.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's something like eight out of 10 times, when a spouse dies the other one's involved.",
      "Aya Gruber: Absolutely.",
      "Sometimes the smallest item will turn an investigation, and, in this case, agents seized on a clear plastic cap that a forensics team had found in the family's dryer. Prosecutors believe the cap was from a syringe used to fill a tranquilizer dart.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How do prosecutors interpret that?",
      "Aya Gruber: The prosecution's theory is that at some point, when Barry came home on the 9th and snapped, and decided to murder Suzanne, he used a tranquilizer dart that you would use on animals \u2026",
      "There was no working tranquilizer rifle found in the Morphew's home. But Barry told investigators he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. He knew how to load darts with paralyzing chemicals, having used them to illegally sedate deer and remove their antlers to sell.",
      "We asked Dan Ridenour to read some of what Barry told investigators.",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: Barry said, \"The first thing I thought of when I came here and saw deer in my yard with big horns, I'm like, 'I'm getting them horns.'\"",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: \"And I'll tell you exactly what I did \u2026 I shoot 'em. They go to sleep, I cut their horns off \u2026 It's totally illegal \u2026 But you're gonna find tranq darts around my property because I've done that.\"",
      "Experts say it can take between 4 and 20 minutes for an animal the size of a deer to drop after being shot with a tranquilizer dart. Agents theorized that Barry's phone had pinged from various locations around the house\u2014not because he was shooting chipmunks, but because he was chasing Suzanne after he shot her.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators find a doorframe within the Morphew home that has been broken. And they say that there could have been a chase and then a struggle.",
      "Andrew Katers, the owner and CEO of Animal Care and Equipment Services, showed us a tranquilizer rifle he'd typically use on animals.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what are you holding?",
      "Andrew Katers: What I'm holding is a TeleDart model 706 rifle \u2026 they use this a lot in parks throughout the country.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And this does not fire bullets or shot?",
      "Andrew Katers: It only fires darts. \u2026 It's impossible to \u2014 get it to do anything else.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Could you now demonstrate for me?",
      "Andrew Katers: Sure. [fires rifle]",
      "Peter\u00a0Van Sant: So, if Suzanne had been struck by one of these darts \u2026 would she have time to run around, try to escape?",
      "Andrew Katers: She could. But I don't think she would get very far.",
      "Peter Van Sant: For a human being, it could be lethal.",
      "Andrew Katers: For sure.",
      "Bolstering the theory that Barry and Suzanne had a confrontation the day she disappeared were apparent scratches seen on Barry's left arm. Agents took the circumstantial evidence they gathered \u2014 Barry's apparently suspicious behavior, his contradictory statements, the puzzling data from his truck, Suzanne's disturbing texts and those five trash runs \u2014 and brought it all to the district attorney.",
      "On nearly the anniversary of Suzanne's disappearance, Barry is arrested in May 2021.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Tonight, the husband of Suzanne Morphew is behind bars accused of killing her. \u2026 The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office says that Barry Morphew was arrested this morning.",
      "Despite the lack of a body, Barry was charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence, and a variety of other allegations. He was held without bail and eventually pleaded not guilty.",
      "In their arrest affidavit, prosecutors spelled out what they believe happened to Suzanne:",
      "\"It had become clear that Barry could not control Suzanne's insistence on leaving him and he resorted to something he has done his entire life \u2014 hunt and control Suzanne like he had hunted and controlled animals.\"",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda reacted to the news of Barry's arrest.",
      "Melinda Moorman: There are no winners in this story. There are two families who are suffering deeply.",
      "Barry ultimately hired high-profile lawyers from Denver, and, in the summer of 2021, Judge Patrick Murphy heard the prosecution's evidence in open court.",
      "Ashley Franco: He decided to hold a preliminary hearing to see if this case had enough evidence to go to trial.",
      "The defense tried mightily to blunt the state's case, countering that the clear, plastic cap found in the dryer means nothing because no one could say how long it had been there. Furthermore, Suzanne's DNA was found on the cap, not Barry's. And as for that chlorine smell in Barry's hotel room \u2026",
      "Aya Gruber: One of the managers from the Holiday Inn had actually communicated to agents that this smell of chlorine existed before Barry Morphew was there \u2026 because that room's directly above an indoor pool.",
      "And there was one more crucial issue the prosecution had to deal with \u2014 one that its own forensic team uncovered. DNA evidence made public for the first time now threatened to destroy the case against Barry.",
      "Aya Gruber: This DNA discovery is so significant. The agents swab the inside of Suzanne Morphew's car and they found male DNA on the glove box, and it wasn't Barry Morphew's DNA. He was eliminated.",
      "The DNA also did not match Suzanne's lover Jeff Libler. But it did partially match the DNA of an unknown male who had attacked other women and it raised a disturbing question: had Suzanne fallen into the hands of a sexual predator?",
      "DA: AUTHORITIES ARE \"CLOSE\" TO FINDING SUZANNE'S BODY",
      "In September 2021 at the Chaffee County Courthouse in Salida, Judge Patrick Murphy heard arguments about whether there was enough evidence to try Barry Morphew for murder.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge named off three different scenarios, saying, \"Suzanne Morphew left willingly, Barry Morphew could have killed his wife, or someone else abducted Suzanne and killed her.\"",
      "He said it was \"unlikely\" Suzanne had run off on her own, even though she and lover Jeff Libler had discussed moving to Ecuador.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge says that because of the evidence that's \u2026 been presented about how loving Suzanne was toward her daughters and toward her family \u2026 that she could never do that.\"",
      "But the abduction theory could not be so easily dismissed \u2014 especially after that mysterious DNA was found in Suzanne's Range Rover. Investigators learned that DNA at least partially matched the profile of an unnamed man connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in Tempe, Phoenix and Chicago.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So how can that DNA end up in her car?",
      "Aya Gruber: Well, that DNA can end up in her car if she was the victim, for example, of a serial killer \u2026 or if the person was hired or opportunistic \u2026 There could also be potentially an innocent explanation that at some point, you know, the person came in contact with the car randomly as a mechanic \u2026 but it is very, very curious.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Barry Morphew can stand up and say, \"I'm not your killer. The man whose DNA is in my wife's car, tied to past sexual assaults, that's your killer.\"",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew absolutely could say that. And that's what his defense is banking on in this case.",
      "In frank language, Judge Murphy gave his opinion of the state's evidence: \"I find that the proof is not evident nor is the presumption great that Mr. Morphew committed first-degree murder.\"",
      "Despite that, the judge ruled there was probable cause to go to trial.",
      "Aya Gruber: But this judge was very careful to say, \"Look, I'm finding probable cause here, but it's only because I am looking at all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"",
      "Murphy said he was \"obligated\" to set bond for Barry.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge sets $500,000 cash-only bond.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And are they monitoring him in some fashion?",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew is wearing an ankle monitor for them to track him, to make sure that he is staying in Chaffee County.",
      "A few days later on September 20, 2021, Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy are all smiles as they leave the jail. They stand firmly behind their dad. Barry declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview.",
      "Barry Morphew's homicide trial was to begin on April 28, 2022, but in the months leading up to that date Judge Murphy recused himself and and was replaced by Judge Ramsey Lama.. And Barry's defense team, led by attorney Iris Eytan, filed motions asking that prosecutors be sanctioned for \"failing to produce discovery in a timely manner\" including some potentially exculpatory evidence \u2014  like the male DNA found in Suzanne's Range Rover.",
      "Iris Eytan: There's DNA that is placed on all the critical items of evidence in this case \u2014 on the bike, on the bike helmet, in the house, in the car \u2014   that is linked to unknown males.",
      "In April 2022, Judge Lama ruled that prosecutors repeatedly had missed deadlines and had failed to turn over important information in the discovery phase. The judge wrote that while he did not find those actions \"willful \u2026 the court does find this pattern to be negligent, bordering on, reckless.\" The judge's penalty was to knock out 14 prosecution witnesses \u2014 including experts in DNA and cell phone and vehicle data recovery. They would not, he said, be allowed to testify.",
      "Law professor Aya Gruber said the case was going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors even before she heard about the most recent sanctions.",
      "Aya Gruber: This case is incredibly unique. There are not many \u2026 murder cases \u2014   where the defendant has been charged with first-degree murder, where there is no body, no blood evidence of any foul play, no eyewitnesses.",
      "On April 19, 2022, as a pre-trial hearing was about to begin, District Attorney Linda Stanley filed a motion to dismiss the murder charges against Barry Morphew without prejudice, meaning the case could be refiled at a later date. In her motion, the DA pointed to the court's decision to bar \"several key witnesses \u2026 without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"",
      "Neither Barry, his daughters nor his lawyer had any advance warning.",
      "Iris Eytan: I didn't know a dismissal was coming today, although the writing was on the wall \u2026",
      "In her motion for dismissal, Stanley told the judge that officials believe they are close to discovering the location of Suzanne Morphew's body. Court papers specifically mentioned \"a remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence\" that will be excavated after five feet of snow melts.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Where is Suzanne Morphew's body? That is the million-dollar question.",
      "Remember, there was an approximate four-hour gap not recorded by the computers in Barry's truck on Mother's Day morning 2020. Whether investigators ultimately were able to recover some of that missing data or received a tip about the location of Suzanne's remains is not known.",
      "Dan Ridenour: The San Isabel National Forest, again, is 1.1 million acres. There's plenty of places to dispose of \u2014  of a body.",
      "Defense attorney Eytan denies Barry has any involvement in his wife's disappearance.",
      "Iris Eytan: Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew.\u00a0 He loves her and he misses her, and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.",
      "After the judge granted the motion to dismiss homicide charges against Barry, he walked out of court a free man, flanked as usual by his loyal daughters.",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda says she agrees with the request to dismiss charges against Barry at this point. She said she hoped that, with more time, searchers will find Suzanne's body and win \"a solid conviction in her murder. This would dispel all rumors of her whereabouts.\"",
      "And whatever else happens with the case, Melinda says she hopes her nieces keep one thing in mind.",
      "Melinda Moorman: \"Mallory, Macy \u2026 Your mother would have laid down her life for you girls \u2026 She would never leave you. She would never forsake you. She loved you with her whole being.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's remains were found in 2023 in a shallow grave about 40 miles south of their home.",
      "The coroner ruled Suzanne's death a homicide. A combination of drugs commonly used to tranquilize wildlife was found in her bone marrow.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:59:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date for Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years.",
      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of a group of migrants seeking asylum and three immigrants' rights groups.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Trump's plan to sharply restrict access to the nation's asylum system, a blow to the president's sweeping crackdown on immigration into the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of 13 individuals seeking asylum in the U.S. and three immigrants' rights groups who argued that a proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on his first day back in office \u2014 which has been a pillar of his immigration agenda \u2014 is unlawful.",
      "In his decision, Moss ruled that neither the Immigration and Nationality Act nor the Constitution give the president and administration officials \"the sweeping authority\" asserted in his proclamation and subsequent guidance implementing the directive.",
      "\"The court recognizes that the executive branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country,\" he wrote. \"But the INA, by its terms, provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country.\"",
      "Moss said that a pair of provisions of federal immigration law do not provide \"the president with the unilateral authority to limit the rights of aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum.\"",
      "He further found that the Constitution does not give the president the authority to \"adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted and the regulations that the responsible agencies have promulgated.\"",
      "In addition to finding Mr. Trump's plan to limit access to asylum, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request to certify a class of all people covered by the president's proclamation or its implementation who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "The judge postponed the effective date of his class-wide order for 14 days to give the Trump administration time to seek emergency relief from the federal appeals court in Washington. He also put off a decision on whether to certify a class of individuals who were subject to Mr. Trump's new asylum rules and are no longer in the U.S.",
      "\"The significance of the decision cannot be overstated,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs. \"The ruling not only means the U.S. will once again be a safe haven for those fleeing persecution but also reaffirms that the laws Congress enacts must be respected by the president.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has rolled out a series of plans aimed at targeting migrants in the U.S. His efforts began on the first day of his second term, when Mr. Trump took unilateral action to prevent most migrants crossing the southern border from applying for asylum or withholding of removal, a type of relief that prevents the Department of Homeland Security from deporting a migrant to their home country because of likely persecution.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation cited an alleged \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and directed administration officials to take action to \"repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States.\"",
      "The migrants and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration in early February and sought to block enforcement of the president's proclamation, arguing it is \"as unlawful as it is unprecedented.\"",
      "Moss, appointed by former President Barack Obama, held a hearing in April to consider their bid to invalidate the plan.",
      "In his decision, the judge found that neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and National Act authorize the changes in immigration law that Mr. Trump has sought to make.",
      "He wrote that the president \"lacks the inherent constitutional authority\" to supplant federal statutes governing removals.",
      "\"To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional,\" Moss wrote.",
      "As with his first term, immigration has remained a focal point of the president's second term, and he has undertaken a number of actions that he says are aimed at targeting the purported \"invasion\" at the southern border. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have sparked legal battles. Mr. Trump has invoked a 1798 wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua and has ended programs put in place by former President Joe Biden that shielded nearly 1 million migrants from the threat of deportation.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

    "summary": "Alabama beekeepers recently trapped a swarm of killer bees, prompting state officials to respond in hopes of controlling the notoriously aggressive insects.",
    "story": [
      "Beekeepers in southeastern Alabama recently trapped a \"feral swarm\" of killer bees, \u00a0according to the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries, the latest in a recent string of killer bee sightings across the U.S.",
      "Officials said the swarm was humanely euthanized to protect the state's honeybee populations, which, University of Georgia researchers note, can be threatened by this more aggressive bee subspecies.",
      "Killer bees, also called Africanized honeybees, are a notoriously dangerous breed known for their defensiveness, according to the Smithsonian Institution. Unlike most bees typically seen in the U.S., which are technically European honeybees, these killer bees became feared after attacking humans and animals in relatively large numbers. The Smithsonian writes in a description of killer bees on its website that the insects \"have killed some 1,000 humans\" since their introduction to the Americas in 1956, \"with victims receiving ten times as many stings than from the European strain.\"",
      "In Alabama, the agricultural department said traps were set across a five-mile stretch of land near the site in Barbour County where beekeepers spotted the swarm. The department has also taken steps to establish targeted monitoring procedures in the area, to assess whether additional swarms are present. Officials said that was \"a precautionary response,\" to protect pollinating honeybees as well as beekeepers.",
      "\"There is no reason for public concern at this time, but we are treating this situation seriously,\" said Rick Pate, the commissioner of the agricultural department, in a statement. \"Our team is actively collaborating with local beekeepers and entomology experts to ensure swift detection and appropriate response. Protecting both the health of our communities and Alabama's honeybee populations is our top priority.\"",
      "The department warned members of the public to avoid provoking any bee population suspected to contain killer bees, as \u00a0they \"may respond in greater numbers when disturbed\" and \"pursue perceived threats farther than European honeybees,\" potentially following them for up to a mile. In comparison, European honeybees have been known to stalk victims of an attack for up to a quarter of a mile.",
      "Alabama's discovery has followed a spate of killer bee sightings across the country. In the last three months alone, swarms in Texas attacked and killed one man, and led to three others being hospitalized after disturbing a colony, CBS News Miami reported. According to the news site AZ Family, a swarm chased a group of hikers for about a mile near the end of a trail in a Phoenix suburb, and each hiker required medical attention as a result.",
      "Killer bees have been spotted in 13 U.S. states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. South Florida has the highest number of them compared with any other state, according to CBS News Miami.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures, and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money, but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

      "Coco Gauff became just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open, eliminated 7-6 (3), 6-1 by unseeded Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine on Tuesday night.",
      "The No. 2-ranked Gauff made mistake after mistake at No. 1 Court, finishing with just six winners and a total of 29 unforced errors that included nine double-faults.",
      "\"Dayana started off playing strong,\" Gauff said. \"I couldn't find my footing out there today.\"",
      "She joined another highly seeded American, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, in bowing out on Day 2 of the tournament. In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",
      "The transition from clay to grass has proven tough for most players, and the last woman to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season was Serena Williams a decade ago.",
      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",
      "\"I love playing on grass. I feel that this year we are kind of friends,\" Yastremska said with a laugh. \"I hope the road will continue for me here.\"",

    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

His having a successor would mean he would be reincarnated.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said at prayer celebrations ahead of his upcoming 90th birthday that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signaling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama's succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing Wednesday said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\"",

      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says Israel has agreed to conditions for a Gaza ceasefire and he's urging Hamas to back it, but neither side has committed to anything yet.",
    "story": [
      "It appeared on Wednesday that President Trump likely still has some deal-making to do before he can claim to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to end the devastating war in Gaza. Mr. Trump said in a Tuesday evening social media post that Israel had \"agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\" a 60-day ceasefire, and he called on Hamas to accept the deal, warning the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that \"it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Israeli sources told CBS News on Wednesday that while there was strong backing in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet for the terms in the proposal, Israel was not committing to it yet, stressing that the government had voiced its backing to U.S. officials for a proposed framework for a ceasefire deal, not a final agreement.",
      "In a statement, Hamas credited mediators Qatar and Egypt for having \"exerted intensive efforts to bridge the gap between the parties and reach a framework agreement that would pave the way for a serious round of negotiations.\"",
      "\"We are approaching this with a high sense of responsibility and are conducting national consultations to discuss the proposals presented by the mediators,\" Hamas said, reiterating its long-standing calls for a truce that brings the war to an end, sees Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza, \"and urgently delivers relief to our people in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't offer any details of the proposed deal in his post on Tuesday evening, but he said that Qatar and Egypt \u2014 which have been key partners to the U.S. as it attempts to broker an agreement to end the nearly two-year war \u2014 would \"deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, in a post on social media Wednesday, said there was \"a great majority in the government and also among the people for a framework to release hostages. If there is an opportunity to do so \u2014 we must not miss it!\"",
      "But that claim of cohesion may belie a potentially significant hurdle for Netanyahu as he prepares to head to Washington this weekend to meet with Mr. Trump, who's made it clear he wants to see a deal to end the war within days.",
      "Numerous Israeli media outlets reported Wednesday that one of the most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, had called on far-right nationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to join him in blocking the government's approval of the ceasefire deal.",
      "Neither Smotrich nor Ben-Gvir confirmed any discussion about blocking the agreement, but in a short post on social media, Ben-Gvir said the war in Gaza should not end \"a moment before defeating Hamas.\" Both men have been vocal in rejecting peace deals with Hamas, insisting that the group must be completely destroyed, not negotiated with.",
      "Yair Golan, leader of the Israeli opposition Democrats party, accused Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in a social media post of \"leading a bloc to prevent the return of the hostages.\" He said they \"do not deserve to sit around the government table. And whoever continues to allow them to sit there does not deserve to lead Israel for even one more day.\"",
      "While the real prospects of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a ceasefire in the short time frame that Mr. Trump is hoping for remained unclear, even the suggestion that peace could be looming may raise hopes for Gazans who risk their lives every day just to line up lining up for food.",
      "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation responds to criticism",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health says at least 640 civilians have been shot to death in recent weeks trying to access desperately needed humanitarian supplies, including more than 400 at distribution sites run by the heavily criticized U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Since it began operating in the war-torn enclave on May 26, GHF has faced near daily claims of aid-seekers being killed by Israeli forces as they try to reach its four hubs in Gaza.",
      "Earlier this week, more than 170 humanitarian groups called for the opaquely run organization \u2014   which has never revealed its funding or management structure \u2014   to be disbanded and all aid efforts in Gaza to be reorganized under the long-established United Nations-led system. Those international humanitarian efforts have been largely blocked by Israel since March.",
      "The Israeli military says it works with the GHF to enable aid distribution without the risk of food and other goods being stolen by Hamas.",
      "The Trump administration has backed that reasoning and refused to support other means of food dispersal in Gaza, instead calling on other nations and institutions to work with the GHF, which replaced some 400 international aid distribution points in the Palestinian territory with just four of its hubs. Those hubs are run by armed U.S. private security contractors, and the Israeli military controls access to them.",
      "All established humanitarian agencies have refused to work with the GHF, saying it forces Palestinians to dislocate and trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles, but the Trump administration announced late last week its first public support for the group: $30 million in funding.",
      "The State Department wouldn't say, when that funding was announced, if the funds had already been transferred to GHF, or which U.S. government account they would come from.",
      "The GHF has declined to respond to multiple questions from CBS News about its connections with the U.S. and Israeli governments and its funding, and it had, until this week, also declined to be interviewed by CBS News about its operations. On Tuesday, however, the GHF's director, American evangelical reverend Johnnie Moore, a former adviser to President Trump on religious matters, agreed to an interview via Zoom.",
      "Our first question was about the reports CBS News has received since GHF began its operations, directly from doctors and eyewitnesses, that Israeli soldiers have repeatedly opened fire on unarmed civilians trying to reach its aid hubs.",
      "\"I do not want to diminish these reports, but we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites,\" Moore told CBS News.",
      "Asked how many more people would die before GHF changed the way it operates, Moore called the framing of the question \"inappropriate,\" and said the group's \"whole reason for existing is to give food to these people so they can live.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014   and those of the White House \u2014   for the United Nations and its various humanitarian agencies to join GHF's efforts in Gaza.",
      "\"We've said again and again to the U.N., to the WFP (World Food Program), join us in this effort,\" Moore said, before asking CBS News' correspondent, \"with respect, why don't you join us? I'm asking you to help us run the operation if you think there is a better way to do this.\"",
      "Asked how GHF has been able to verify who exactly receives the aid it provides on the ground \u2014   which Moore has stressed does not reach Hamas \u2014 the reverend responded with a question: \"Do you have anything positive to say about what we are doing?\"",
      "\"Do you think it is acceptable that people die every day trying to access aid? Is there not a better way to do this?\" CBS News asked again.",
      "\"We have made a decision that it is worth working in a war zone,\" Moore said, \"as deadly as it is, because Gazans deserve food.\"",
      "Moore would not respond to questions about how GHF operates or who funds the organization, beside the $30 million contribution announced this week by the Trump administration.",

      "The iconic image of a smoking Parisian is becoming a thing of the past as France has banned smoking in most public areas.",
      "France's new law dictates that tobacco must disappear where there are children, and parents, as well as the majority of the country, agree. Those who choose to smoke in public in areas like the beach or the park could face a fine. The ban also applies to bus shelters, areas near libraries, swimming pools and schools.",
      "Violators could face a fine of 135 euros ($160) up to a maximum of 700 euros ($826), according to French news agency AFP. However, the health ministry is expecting an initial grace period as the new rules go into effect this week.",
      "For decades, lighting up a cigarette was less a vice than a vibe \u2014 part of the cultural mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. More than 200 people in France die each day of tobacco-related illness, Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said in a statement Saturday. That adds up to 75,000 people dying from smoking each year, and the French government wanted the chapter to fade to black.",
      "The ban aims \"to promote what we call denormalization. In people's minds, smoking is normal,\" Philippe Bergerot, president of the French League Against Cancer, told the Associated Press. \"We aren't banning smoking; we are banning smoking in certain places where it could potentially affect people's health and ... young people.\"",
      "It has been illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars and public buildings since a series of bans in 2007 and 2008. Ever-higher taxes mean a pack now costs upwards of 12 euros ($14).",
      "Yet more than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, most of them daily, one of the\u00a0higher rates in Europe and globally. The Health Ministry is particularly concerned that tobacco remains popular among young people, citing public health statistics showing that 15% of 17-year-olds smoke. Black market cigarette trading is common.",
      "There remains one final refuge for smokers \u2014 at caf\u00e9 terraces on many sidewalks.",
      "Catherine Querard, the president of France's national restaurant lobby, told CBS that the terraces are \"a space of freedom.\"",
      "\"Terraces are relationships, socialization and it's very important for us,\" Querard said. They are also a pillar of France's identity and economy. Querard  says a third of all caf\u00e9 terrasse sales happen outside.",
      "Some smokers say they get the new ban, but others think their right is being restricted.",
      "\"I'm a smoker. I smoke because I'm stressed, not because it's my pleasure,\" one smoker on the street of Paris told CBS News. \"To us, this is the last defense for smoking. But honestly? It's part of the freedom we enjoy in France. If you restrict that \u2026 another freedom disappears.\"",

      "Visitors to the Eiffel Tower without tickets were told to postpone their visits as the summit of the city's landmark was closed until Thursday. The operators said the closure was \"to ensure everyone's comfort and safety.\"",
      "It's rare for the Eiffel Tower \u2014 open 365 days a year and one of the biggest tourist attractions in the world \u2014 to close. The tower briefly closed in February 2024 for six days due to a strike. It also closed for about three months in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, its longest closure since World War II.",

      "Coco Gauff became just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open, eliminated 7-6 (3), 6-1 by unseeded Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine on Tuesday night.",
      "The No. 2-ranked Gauff made mistake after mistake at No. 1 Court, finishing with just six winners and a total of 29 unforced errors that included nine double-faults.",
      "\"Dayana started off playing strong,\" Gauff said. \"I couldn't find my footing out there today.\"",
      "She joined another highly seeded American, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, in bowing out on Day 2 of the tournament. In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",

      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",

After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",

      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",

      "The charges arose from what law enforcement officials described as a nationwide operation that also resulted in the seizure of financial accounts, websites and laptops that were used to carry out the fraud.",
      "Separate cases in Georgia and Massachusetts represent the latest Justice Department effort to confront a persistent threat that officials say generates enormous revenue for the North Korean government and in some cases affords workers access to sensitive and proprietary data from the American corporations that hire them.",
      "The scheme involved thousands of workers who, armed with stolen or fake identities, were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American companies, including Fortune 500 corporations. The companies were duped into believing that the workers they hired were based in the U.S. when many were actually stationed in North Korea or China, and the wages the victimized companies paid were transferred into accounts controlled by co-conspirators affiliated with North Korea, prosecutors say.",
      "On Monday, U.S. prosecutors announced the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing \"Danny\" Wang of New Jersey. A five-count indictment describes a \"multi-year fraud scheme by Wang and his co-conspirators to obtain remote IT work with U.S. companies that generated more than $5 million in revenue,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "The indictment also charges six Chinese nationals and two Taiwanese nationals for their roles in the scheme.",
      "\"These schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,\" Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.",
      "In one case exposed on Monday in federal court in Massachusetts, the Justice Department said it had arrested one U.S. national and charged more than a half dozen Chinese and Taiwanese citizens for their alleged roles in an elaborate fraud that prosecutors say produced several million dollars in revenue and affected scores of companies.",
      "The conspiracy, court papers say, involved the registration of financial accounts to receive the proceeds and the creation of shell companies and fake websites to make it look like the remote workers were associated with legitimate businesses. Enablers inside the United States facilitated the workers' remote computer access, tricking companies into believing the workers were logging in from U.S. locations.",
      "The Justice Department did not identify the companies that were duped, but said that some of the fraudulent workers were able to gain access to and steal information related to sensitive military technology.",
      "The case filed in Georgia charges four North Korean IT workers with stealing virtual currency worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from their employers. The defendants remain at large.",
      "The Justice Department has filed similar prosecutions in recent years, as well as created an initiative aimed at disrupting the threat.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other people living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government.",
      "Last December, a Chinese national living in California was charged after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to buy the equipment.",
      "In May 2024, federal prosecutors\u00a0accused\u00a0an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

As a result of rising temperatures, extreme weather events including hurricanes, droughts, floods and heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, scientists warn.",
      "Seventy-three percent of all 1,172 non-marine sites on the UNESCO Heritage List are exposed to at least one severe water risk \u2014 including water stress, drought, river flooding or coastal flooding, UNESCO said.",
      "\"Water stress is projected to intensify, most notably in regions like the Middle East and North Africa, parts of South Asia and northern China \u2014 posing long-term risks to ecosystems, cultural heritage, and the communities and tourism economies that depend on them,\" it added.",
      "Cultural sites were most commonly threatened by water scarcity, while more than half of natural sites faced the risk of flooding from a nearby river, the UNESCO study showed.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal monument in Agra, for example, \"faces water scarcity that is increasing pollution and depleting groundwater, both of which are damaging the mausoleum,\" the study said.",
      "In the United State, \"in 2022, a massive flood closed down all of Yellowstone National Park and cost over $20 million in infrastructure repairs to reopen.\"",
      "The report gave four more examples.",
      "Iraq's southern marshes \u2014 the reputed home of the biblical Garden of Eden \u2014 \"face extremely high water stress, where over 80 percent of the renewable supply is withdrawn to meet human demand,\" it added.",
      "And competition for water is expected to increase in the marshes, where migratory birds live and inhabitants raise buffalo, as the region grows hotter in coming years.",
      "On the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Victoria Falls \u2014 originally called Mosi-oa-Tunya (\"the smoke that thunders\") before it was renamed by Scottish explorer David Livingstone \u2014 has faced recurring drought and is sometimes reduced to a trickle.",
      "In Peru, the pre-Colombian city of Chan Chan and its delicate 1,000-year-old adobe walls face an extremely high risk of river flooding, UNESCO said.",
      "In China, rising sea levels driven in large part by climate change are leading to coastal flooding, which destroys mudlands where migratory waterbirds find food, it added.",
      "The specific warning over flooding and drought comes about a decade after an independent\u00a0scientific study\u00a0found that 720 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Statue of Liberty and the Tower of London, could be consumed by rising seas within 2,000 years if the climate continues warming at current rates.",
      "The study calculated that 136 sites would be in danger if global average temperatures rise to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial levels \u2014 a figure well within the range projected in the latest U.N. report on climate change, which projected that without significant policy changes, there's a 97% likelihood of a 2-degree Celsius warming, and a 37% chance of 3-degree Celsius average warming.",

We must repeat \u2013 with no reservation \u2013 that we believe and support our client who showed exemplary courage throughout this trial.

A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence. The transportation to engage in prostitution charge could carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion may carry a 20-year sentence.",
      "There are three options now left for the jury. The judge instructed the jury to continue deliberating for now. A second option would be to give supplemental jury instructions.

    "summary": "Healthcare crisis impacts rural America as emergency rooms struggle with unpaid services, overcrowding and staff safety issues, while federal officials consider potential solutions",
    "story": [
      "Many rural hospitals were at risk of closing before the pandemic, and stayed open with the help of COVID funds",
      "There is a healthcare crisis brewing in the nation\u2019s heartland, as evidenced by a landmark study conducted by the RAND Corporation in conjunction with top national emergency physicians.",
      "The study from the Arlington nonprofit research institute found that emergency rooms (ERs) are no longer the safety net but the proverbial \"front door\" to the U.S. healthcare system, particularly after a 1986 law passed requiring ERs to stabilize patients or deliver babies from women in labor regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "That has led to instability and hospital closures across the heartland, including in states where a dozen or more have closed, like Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. States like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas and Alabama have also been affected.",
      "\"This RAND study is the first ever that points to this crisis, which is that the emergency departments and the care that patients receive in them usually is so critical that, especially for time-sensitive conditions that patients can have, just the fact that you have to travel as far as you might have to, or that even in some cases if a hospital is close to you, but it still doesn't have the resources to operate efficiently,\" said Dr. Randy Pilgrim, an ER doctor and chief medical officer for emergency room services company SCP Health in Atlanta.",
      "BLISTERING REPORT CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO 5 'WOKE' HOSPITALS PUSHING 'RADICAL' AGENDA WITH TAXPAYER MONEY",
      "\"[I]n emergency medicine, we do time-sensitive, high-quality care as long as we have the resources to do it. And this study shows that we really have a crisis brewing here.\"",
      "Nearly $5.9 billion in emergency services go unpaid every year, the study found. Overcrowding and spates of violence towards staff have exacerbated the problem.",
      "EMTALA, the aforementioned law, is essentially an unfunded mandate in many cases, and lack of funding for hospitals that treat a large proportion of that uncompensated care \u2014 which tends to fall in rural areas or poor neighborhoods in cities \u2014 leads to the dual issue of higher patient volumes and more uninsured patients being seen.",
      "Many hospitals outside of cities cannot fully account for the funding gap, Pilgrim said.",
      "\"The economics of reimbursement for physician care play a huge role. \u2026 We need more physicians generally in America, and we need physicians to feel like they can and will go to where they're needed,\" he said.",
      "\"Physicians won't go where they are needed if there's not enough resources or reimbursement to attract them.\"",
      "Rural hospitals characteristically pay less than higher-end urban hospitals and have fewer local resources.",
      "With hospital demand \"higher than ever,\" all of the above factors mean help is needed now.",
      "Pilgrim said he has met with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and other top officials at the agency, to discuss the issue \u2014 and hopes Washington can help.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy\u2026 did a beautiful job of listening to what we were saying about the impending crisis that would probably happen during this administration,\" Pilgrim said.",
      "TEXAS HOSPITALS HIT WITH $122 MILLION BILL FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' CARE IN SINGLE MONTH",
      "An ER sign (iStock)",
      "\"And he was concerned about it because he could tell that you can't make patients healthy unless you have a healthy healthcare system for them to engage. So I'm very encouraged about what Secretary Kennedy and his staff are doing to try to make a difference on the pieces that they control.\"",
      "He also said Congress must act, particularly as 10,000 Americans turn 65 every day and are therefore eligible for Medicare, which presents a different environment than separate Medicaid.",
      "\"That's where we see more volume of patients, more complexity, and much more clinical demand. But if the reimbursement in Medicare doesn't keep pace with that demand, once again, you're in this vicious cycle where emergency departments will be at greater risk, starting with the rural and underserved areas and moving forward from there.\"",
      "Some in Congress have banded together to advocate for healthcare-related issues, including members of the bicameral \"Doctors Caucus.\"",
      "One member, Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., is a urologist from Greenville who previously served as chief of staff at a Level-I trauma center. \"Congress cannot leave rural America behind,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"The most important thing Congress can do is to fix dwindling Medicare reimbursements for rural providers and ensure health insurance companies don\u2019t play games with denied care and denied payments,\" he said, pinning the decrease at 33% since 2001 if adjusted for inflation,\" Murphy told Fox News Digital.",
      "The lawmaker added that many hospitals in his area do not have commercial payers as part of their funding sources to help offset losses from Medicare and Medicaid disbursement amounts \u2014 and that all hospitals must root out waste as well.",
      "Pilgrim was also asked why Americans outside the heartland with more reliable emergency care should be supportive of added funding or resources miles away from them.",
      "\"In a large city like Atlanta, if rural healthcare is not healthy and patients have to go somewhere else, they will eventually end up in your hospital\u2026 So spending a dollar somewhere else besides in your own hospital if you're in a better place makes a lot of sense for you\u2026\" he said.",

      "'The Big Weekend Show' discusses Democratic and Republican TikTokers mocking each others' makeup looks.",
      "Google DeepMind has introduced a powerful on-device version of its Gemini Robotics AI.",
      "This new system allows robots to complete complex tasks without relying on a cloud connection. Known as Gemini Robotics On-Device, the model brings Gemini's advanced reasoning and control capabilities directly into physical robots. It is designed for fast, reliable performance in places with poor or no internet connectivity, making it ideal for real-world, latency-sensitive environments.",

      "Robots using Gemini Robotics On-Device. (Google)",
      "Smarter robots that work anywhere",
      "Unlike its cloud-connected predecessor, this version runs entirely on the robot itself. It can understand natural language, perform fine motor tasks and generalize from very little data, all without requiring an internet connection. According to Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, the system is \"small and efficient enough\" to operate directly onboard. Developers can use the model in situations where connectivity is limited, without sacrificing intelligence or flexibility.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Easy to adapt and train",
      "Gemini Robotics On-Device can be customized with just 50 to 100 demonstrations. The model was first trained using Google's ALOHA robot, but it has already been adapted to other platforms like Apptronik's Apollo humanoid and the Franka FR3. For the first time, developers can fine-tune a DeepMind robotics model. Google is offering access through its trusted tester program and has released a full SDK to support experimentation and development.",
      "Robot using Gemini Robotics On-Device. (Google)",
      "Local control means more privacy and reliability",
      "Since the artificial intelligence runs directly on the robot, all data stays local. This approach offers better privacy for sensitive applications, such as in healthcare. It also allows robots to continue operating during internet outages or in isolated environments. Google sees this version as a strong fit for remote, security-sensitive, or infrastructure-poor settings. The system delivers faster response times and fewer points of failure, opening up new possibilities for robot deployment in real-world settings.",
      "Safety requires developer input",
      "The on-device model does not include built-in semantic safety features. Google recommends that developers build safety systems into their robots using tools like the Gemini Live API and trusted low-level controllers. The company is limiting access to select developers to better study safety risks and real-world applications. While the hybrid model still offers more overall power, this version holds its own for most common use cases and helps push robotics closer to everyday deployment.",
      "Robots using Gemini Robotics On-Device. (Google)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The release of Gemini Robotics On-Device marks a turning point. Robots no longer need a constant cloud connection to be smart, adaptive, and useful.

You might see a message claiming your account has been locked, offering a gift card or refund, confirming an order you never placed, or asking you to verify payment details or login credentials. These tactics are meant to create urgency or curiosity. It\u2019s important to remember that Amazon will never ask for your password, banking information, or gift card codes by email.",
      "2. Double-check every message: If something feels off, don\u2019t click anything. Instead, visit Amazon.com or open the app to check your order history and account messages. If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats. This extra layer of security helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe. A few quick habits can go a long way in keeping your personal information secure.",

    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",

The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",

      "Meta\u2019s new AI chatbot is getting personal, and it might be sharing more than you realize. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Meta AI, and what does the \"Discover\" tab do?",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. Users can chat casually or deep dive into personal topics, from relationship questions to financial concerns or health issues.",
      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast. These aren't isolated incidents, and as more people use AI for personal support, the stakes will only get higher.",

      "Even casual users should take a moment to review their settings and chat history to make sure personal details aren\u2019t being shared without their knowledge.",
      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "SparkKitty goes even further than SparkCat. According to Kaspersky, SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. This tactic exposes not just wallet data but also any personal or sensitive photos stored on the device. While the main target seems to be crypto seed phrases, criminals could use other images for extortion or malicious purposes.",
      "Kaspersky researchers report that SparkKitty has operated since at least February 2024. Attackers distributed it through both official and unofficial channels, including Google Play and the Apple App Store.",
      "SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kaspersky found SparkKitty embedded in several apps, including one called \u5e01coin on iOS and another called SOEX on Android. Both apps are no longer available in their respective stores. SOEX, a messaging app with cryptocurrency-related features, reached more than 10,000 downloads from the Google Play Store before its removal.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles, often disguised as legitimate components. Once installed, SparkKitty uses a method native to Apple\u2019s Objective-C programming language to run as soon as the app launches. It checks the app\u2019s internal configuration files to decide whether to execute, then quietly starts monitoring the user\u2019s photo library.",
      "On Android, SparkKitty hides in apps written in Java or Kotlin and sometimes uses malicious Xposed or LSPosed modules. It activates when the app launches or after a specific screen opens. The malware then decrypts a configuration file from a remote server and begins uploading images, device metadata, and identifiers.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles. (Apple)",
      "Unlike traditional spyware, SparkKitty focuses on photos, especially those containing cryptocurrency recovery phrases, wallet screenshots, IDs, or sensitive documents. Instead of just monitoring activity, SparkKitty uploads images in bulk. This approach makes it easy for criminals to sift through and extract valuable personal data.",
      "1) Stick to trusted developers:\u00a0Avoid downloading obscure apps, especially if they have few reviews or downloads. Always check the developer's name and history before installing anything.",
      "2) Review app permissions:\u00a0Be cautious of apps that request access to your photos, messages, or files without a clear reason. If something feels off, deny the permission or uninstall the app.",
      "3) Keep your device updated:\u00a0Install system and security updates as soon as they are available. These updates often patch vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",

      "Thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. \"Cyberguy\" Kurt Knutsson explains.",
      "When someone loses the ability to speak because of a neurological condition like ALS, the impact goes far beyond words. It touches every part of daily life, from sharing a joke with family to simply asking for help. Now, thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. This technology isn't just about converting thoughts into text. Instead, it translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly.",

      "There's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. (UC Davis)",
      "Real-time speech through brain signals",
      "The heart of this system is four microelectrode arrays, surgically implanted in the part of the brain responsible for producing speech. These tiny devices pick up the neural activity that happens when someone tries to speak. The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

These details are compiled into detailed personal profiles and sold to advertisers, insurance companies, political campaigns, and in some cases, cybercriminals. What makes this especially concerning is that most of it happens quietly in the background, often without your consent.",

      "How to find out which data brokers have your information and remove it",
      "While no service can completely erase every trace of your data online, using a trusted data removal service is one of the most effective steps you can take. These services actively monitor and submit removal requests to hundreds of data broker websites, saving you hours of tedious work.

      "Get this. You walk up to a robot-run convenience store, place your order on an app, and robotic arms quickly grab your items and deliver them to a secure window, all without any human employees. That's exactly what's happening at VenHub, a fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store that just opened at the LAX/Metro Transit Center in Los Angeles. Even if you haven't seen one in person yet, VenHub's cutting-edge tech is set to shake up how people shop all across the country.",

      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "What Is VenHub? The next evolution of the smart store",
      "Open 24/7 and installable in under a week,\u00a0VenHub is designed for high-traffic environments, such as transit centers, airports, and city hubs, where speed, security, and efficiency are in high demand. Instead of relying on cashiers or attendants, VenHub uses two industrial robotic arms, named Barb and Peter, to handle all product selection and delivery. The process is simple yet futuristic.",
      "Customers place their orders through the VenHub app, pay digitally, and receive a QR code. Upon arrival at the store, the customer scans the code at a secure pickup window. One of the robotic arms then retrieves the items from storage and delivers them to the window within about 90 seconds. The entire transaction is seamless, contactless, and designed to eliminate the frustrations of traditional vending machines or checkout lines.",
      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The technology powering VenHub",
      "VenHub's foundation is a sophisticated blend of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. The robotic arms are similar to those used in automotive manufacturing, engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Rather than attempting to mimic human appearance, these arms are optimized for repetitive, high-accuracy tasks that are perfect for retail fulfillment.",
      "Artificial intelligence drives every aspect of store operations. AI algorithms manage inventory by tracking purchasing patterns, adjusting stock levels, and predicting demand based on time of day, location, and customer behavior. Machine vision allows the robots to accurately identify products and handle them with minimal errors or downtime. The entire system is connected through IoT sensors, providing real-time data on inventory, system health, and order status. This data-driven approach enables VenHub to operate efficiently, minimize waste, and ensure popular items are always available.",
      "From the customer's perspective, everything is managed through a mobile app. This app handles payment, order tracking, and pickup notifications, creating a frictionless and transparent shopping experience. On the backend, analytics continually refine operations, making each store smarter over time.",

      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "Why VenHub's model could change retail nationwide",
      "VenHub's model offers significant advantages that could reshape retail across the country. The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "AI TENNIS ROBOT COACH OFFERS PRO-LEVEL TRAINING ANYTIME, ANYWHERE",
      "The human factor: Are robots replacing jobs or creating new ones?",
      "A common concern with automation is the impact on jobs. VenHub's robots do replace some traditional retail roles, but the company emphasizes that new opportunities are emerging. Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",
      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "VenHub smart store pricing and ownership: What you need to know",
      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance. With high demand and expanding production capacity, VenHub is working to deliver stores to new owners as quickly as possible across the country.",

      "VenHub truly feels like a glimpse into the future of shopping. Watching robots like Barb and Peter grab your order in just seconds is pretty impressive, but what's even more remarkable is that this technology is already making shopping quicker, safer, and a whole lot easier. As these smart stores start popping up in more places across the country, they might totally change not just how we shop. It's interesting to consider that this kind of smart, connected retail experience could soon become something we all use every day, without even thinking twice about it.",

      "A few hundred robots moved a buildng complex covering about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Shanghai is no stranger to jaw-dropping feats of engineering.",
      "In the latest example, a Shanghai historic building moved by robots is capturing global attention. The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",
      "This ambitious project is powered by an army of 432 small robots that are moving the massive structure about 33 feet each day to make way for a new underground development. Let's dive into how this is happening, why it matters and what it means for the future of urban preservation.",

      "Over 400 small robots are moving the complex in Huayang. (Shanghai Government)",
      "What makes the Shanghai historic building moved by robots so special?",
      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design. Zhangyuan itself is over 140 years old and is one of Shanghai's largest and best-preserved shikumen neighborhoods.",

      "DELIVERY ROBOT AUTONOMOUSLY LIFTS AND TRANSPORTS HEAVY CARGO",
      "Why is a Shanghai historic building being moved by robots?",
      "The relocation is not just for show. The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines. By preserving the historic Huayanli complex above ground while adding modern infrastructure below, Shanghai is finding a smart balance between honoring its heritage and embracing progress.",

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from healthcare data breach",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "Why the latest PayPal phishing scam is so convincing",
      "Most phishing scams try (and fail) to impersonate big companies. You\u2019ve probably seen the classics: weird grammar, suspicious email addresses, Microsoft spelled with a \"k\". They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",
      "THE DARK SIDE OF PAYPAL AND HOW TO STAY SAFE",
      "Real examples of the PayPal phishing scam in action",
      "This scam has been reported by dozens of users on Reddit and cybersecurity forums. One Reddit user posted a detailed thread in r/Scams showing screenshots of phishing emails that look like they came straight from PayPal\u2019s official address.",
      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "1. Don\u2019t click links in suspicious emails, even if they look real, and use strong antivirus software. If you receive a PayPal alert you didn\u2019t expect, go to PayPal by typing paypal.com into your browser or using the official app. Never click links or dial phone numbers provided in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Adding 2FA to your PayPal and email accounts gives you a second layer of defense even if your password gets compromised.",
      "3. Use a password manager:\u00a0Using a password manager is the best way to ensure every login you use has a unique, strong password. No repeats means no chain reaction if one site gets hacked. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6. Use a personal data removal service: Since phishing scams like the recent PayPal scam often target personal information that scammers gather from data brokers and people search sites, using a reputable data removal service can help reduce your exposure. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This phishing scam is dangerous because it uses real PayPal emails sent from service@paypal.com. Scammers exploit PayPal\u2019s built-in features to send real notifications that look legitimate. What makes it especially sneaky is the absence of links, Instead, these emails include a phone number, making them more likely to pass through spam filters. When you call, you\u2019re connected to a fake PayPal rep who pressures you into downloading a remote access tool disguised as support software. The safest move? Don\u2019t click, don\u2019t call. Just go straight to PayPal.com and check your account manually.",

That moisture is then heated to kill any microbes, and it passes through a dual-stage UV sterilization system and a carbon filter to remove impurities, bacteria and particles.",
      "Once the water is purified, the Kara Pod adds essential minerals like calcium, magnesium and sodium. This turns into healthy, mineral-rich water that is ready to drink or brew with.

      "Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama announced Wednesday that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, signaling that his successor should be chosen without influence from the Chinese government.",
      "Ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism laid out his succession plans in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in the town of Dharamshala, India. Originally named Tenzin Gyatso, he became what is traditionally known as the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959.",
      "According to an English translation of his speech published on his website, the spiritual leader said the responsibility of choosing the next Dalai Lama \"will rest exclusively with members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust.\"",
      "A non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama, the trust \"should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas,\" the elderly leader said. \"They should accordingly carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition.\"",

      "He reiterated that the Gaden Phodrang Trust \"has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation; no one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\"",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China. After fleeing Tibet, the current Dalai Lama helped establish a democratic Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala, while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "China has claimed authority over selecting the next \"living Buddha,\" as well as the leaders of other religions. It passed a law in 2007 saying the selection of the next Dalai Lama must happen within Chinese territory \u2013 a move condemned by the Tibetan government-in-exile as an affront to religious freedom and an attempt by the Chinese government \"to brutally repress the innocent Tibetans under their tyrannical rule.\"",
      "When asked about the Dalai Lama's announcement during her daily press conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\" Mao said the process must \"follow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations,\" according to The Associated Press.",
      "Mao characterized the current Dalai Lama as a \"political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion,\" and added that he \"has absolutely no right to represent the people\" of Tibet, according to NPR.",
      "The Dalai Lama\u2019s succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China\u2019s tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists, who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",

In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby, or \"soul child,\" and groomed to take the reins.

But according to Dr. Afshon Ostovar, a leading expert on Iran and author of \"Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards,\" said the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes in Iran may have permanently altered its trajectory.",

      "\"What the IRGC tried to achieve over the last 25 years is basically toast,\" Ostovar told Fox News Digital, \"Their campaign to build a military deterrent at home through missiles and nuclear enrichment, and to expand regionally through proxies, has essentially collapsed.\"",
      "Founded in the wake of the 1979 revolution, the IRGC was created to safeguard and spread the Islamic Republic\u2019s values \u2014 often through violence. Ostovar describes how its legitimacy evolved over time, initially drawn from the overthrow of the Shah, then the Iran-Iraq War, and later through the manufactured narrative of an eternal struggle with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Director of FDD's Iran Program Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital the IRGC\u2019s origin reflects a deep mistrust of Iran\u2019s traditional military, which had remained loyal to the Shah.",

      "\"They created a boogeyman in the U.S. and Israel,\" Ostovar added. \"But today, that ideology no longer resonates with most Iranians. The majority want better relations with the West and are tired of the regime\u2019s isolationist stance.\"",

Ostovar says these losses have decimated the IRGC\u2019s regional footprint and forced the regime to reevaluate its strategy.",
      "\"They can try to rebuild everything \u2014 but that would take too long and be too difficult,\" he said. \"More likely, we\u2019ll see them repress harder at home and lean on China and Russia to rebuild conventional military capabilities like air defense and advanced jets.\"",

      "Internally, the IRGC\u2019s economic empire is also under growing strain. Sanctions, cyberattacks, and battlefield losses have made operations far more difficult. Ostovar said that foreign banks avoid any connection with Iran out of fear they may inadvertently deal with IRGC-linked entities, forcing the group to operate through front companies abroad. \"They\u2019ve lost a lot, and now they\u2019ll have to redirect their limited resources to rebuild. That\u2019s going to stretch them even thinner.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 21:17:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The jury in Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial ultimately rejected prosecutors\u2019 assertion that the hip-hop mogul ran a racketeering and sex-trafficking scheme.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. government prosecutors repeatedly told jurors that Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was the ruthless ringleader of a criminal conspiracy, the key figure in a sprawling racketeering and sex trafficking scheme. Combs must be convicted on all five criminal counts, the prosecutors argued, and only then can justice be served.",
      "In the end, the jury was not convinced.",
      "The panel of 12 New Yorkers returned a mixed verdict at the climax of Combs\u2019 federal trial Wednesday, convicting the music mogul on two interstate prostitution counts but acquitting him on the vastly more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, which each carried a maximum prison sentence of life behind bars.",
      "In interviews, legal analysts and former federal prosecutors said the verdict was a blow to the Southern District of New York, which spent seven weeks unwinding an expansive narrative, introducing reams of graphic evidence and calling more than 30 witnesses to the stand. In contrast, the defense team did not call a single witness.",
      "\u201cThis trial was a major gamble, and Combs won that bet,\u201d said Anna Cominsky, an associate professor of law and the director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School. \u201cEverything is stacked against the defendant going into a federal case, in particular one like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis attorneys were smart and they owned the bad facts,\u201d Cominsky added. \u201cThey fought on the things that mattered, and it paid off.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 defense team never disputed their client\u2019s history of domestic violence \u2014 including his physical assault of ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. They also readily acknowledged that Combs arranged drug-dazed, marathon sexual encounters in luxury hotels called \u201cfreak offs.\u201d",
      "But the rapper\u2019s lawyers always insisted that Ventura and another ex-girlfriend, identified in court under the pseudonym \u201cJane,\u201d willingly participated in freak offs. The lawyers highlighted text messages in which both women expressed romantic affection for Combs and sometimes conveyed enthusiasm for their \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "In acquitting Combs of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, jurors effectively rejected the prosecution\u2019s assertion that the music mogul oversaw a criminal enterprise encompassing sex trafficking, forced labor, drug distribution and other acts to fulfill his sexual desires. They may have been persuaded by the defense team\u2019s characterization of Combs as a \u201cswinger\u201d who had been unfairly persecuted for his lifestyle.",
      "In sometimes sarcastic closing arguments last week, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said the case against his client was \u201cbadly exaggerated.\u201d Jeffrey Harris, a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, said jurors might have agreed that the prosecution\u2019s case was overwrought from the start.",
      "\u201cJuries expect more from prosecutors than they do from defense attorneys,\u201d Harris said, \u201cand when prosecutors lose credibility by over-charging it usually does not end well.\u201d",
      "Berit Berger, a former federal prosecutor in both the Southern  and Eastern Districts of New York, disagreed with the suggestion that prosecutors had over-charged Combs, but acknowledged that the defense team may have been successful in puncturing the government\u2019s narrative, especially when it came to the question of consent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that when there\u2019s an acquittal on some counts, but I do think that they [prosecutors] presented evidence that met the legal elements for each of these statutes,\u201d Berger said. \u201cI think the defense really wanted to paint this as a situation where grown women had agency, and could have left this relationship at any time, and they chose to stay, because there were benefits to that.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy guess is that resonated with some of the jurors,\u201d Berger added.",
      "In an interview, another former Justice Department prosecutor said the Combs verdict was a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the office, adding that juries can get hung up on the technical elements in large racketeering conspiracy cases outside of the typical mafia and gang conduct. The jurors in Combs\u2019 case were asked whether prosecutors had proved he had been involved in underlying racketeering acts such as kidnapping, arson and bribery.",
      "\u201cIn those traditional contexts, witnesses can tell you why it all relates to the charged enterprise,\u201d said the former federal prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to express candid views. \u201cWithout that narrator from inside the enterprise or clear explicit ties, it is very hard.\u201d",
      "The former prosecutor said they were curious what a judge would do in post-trial motions, saying a judge could still sentence Combs severely if moved by the evidence, noting that the statutory maximum on each of the two counts he was convicted of is 10 years in prison.",
      "Misty Marris, a defense attorney and legal analyst, said the prosecutors ultimately failed to provide a robust explanation of how Combs\u2019 alleged criminal enterprise worked.",
      "\u201cThey never established what the criminal enterprise was, its purpose, how it operated, who was really involved in it,\u201d Marris said. \u201cThat really never gelled for me, and clearly the jury agreed.\u201d",
      "Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ricky J. Patel, the special agent in charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations, did not directly address the outcome in a statement released after the verdict.",
      "\u201cSex crimes deeply scar victims, and the disturbing reality is that sex crimes are all too present in many aspects of our society,\u201d Clayton and Patel said. \u201cVictims endure gut-wrenching physical and mental abuse, leading to lasting trauma. New Yorkers and all Americans want this scourge stopped and perpetrators brought to justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cProsecuting sex crimes requires brave victims to come forward and tell their harrowing stories,\u201d they added. \u201cWe and our law enforcement partners recognize the hardships victims endure and have prioritized a victim-centered approach to investigating and prosecuting these cases.\u201d",
      "When the verdict was being read inside the courtroom this morning, Combs got on his knees and prayed. The prosecutors remained seated, subdued and by all appearances despondent."

U.S. government prosecutors attempted to paint a scathing portrait of a man who, they argued, refused to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.",
      "Ultimately, though, the jury panel was not convinced that the Grammy-winning rapper led an alleged criminal enterprise or sex-trafficked two of his ex-girlfriends, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura and a woman identified by the pseudonym \u201cJane.\u201d",
      "The mogul\u2019s lawyers insisted that both Ventura and Jane were willing participants in marathon sexual encounters with male escorts in luxury hotel rooms. The defense didn\u2019t call any witnesses to the stand, but it used cross-examinations to portray Ventura and Jane as consenting adults and highlighted text messages in which both women expressed enthusiasm about \u201chotel nights.\u201d",

      "Then the verdict was read to the court. The jurors were stoned-faced and didn\u2019t appear to look directly at the defendant.",
      "Diddy\u2019s team was clearly elated. Teny Geragos, one of his lawyers, wept and wiped away tears with a tissue. The attorneys hugged each other. (In fact, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo hugged Geragos so tightly he picked her up off the floor.) Diddy, for his part, got down on his knees, put his head on his chair and prayed.",
      "Diddy\u2019s family members\u2014 including his mother, Janice Combs \u2014 clapped and cheered loudly. They left the building without taking questions, ignoring the throngs of photographers and passersby who had massed outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cI want to really thank all of you for your hard work and dedication,\u201d U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian told the jurors. He praised them for their \u201ctremendous sacrifice \u2026 with no reward other than answering the call to public service.\u201d",
      "\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Analysis: How will sentencing play out?",
      "Diddy\u2019s defense team and federal prosecutors will submit to the court what they believe is an appropriate sentence for the music mogul.",
      "Misty Marris, a defense attorney and legal analyst, told me that Diddy\u2019s team will likely ask for no more jail time, considering the time served. The prosecution will likely ask for closer to the maximum recommendation.",
      "The probation department then will review the case and make a recommendation based on various factors \u2014 including the fact that this is the first time Diddy has been convicted of this type of charge and his behavior behind bars.",
      "\u201cThe judge is really limited in those sentencing guidelines. There\u2019s discretion up to that 10 years, but they\u2019re going to use those guidelines in order to really pin down what would be appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d Marris told me."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders moved rapidly  Wednesday to try to pass the party's massive domestic policy package after the Senate approved it, launching a full-court press and enlisting the help of President Donald Trump to sway a broad group of holdouts.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can afford only three GOP defections to pass the legislation through his narrow majority, presuming all members attend and Democrats vote against it. On Wednesday morning, Johnson privately huddled just off Capitol Hill with members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, who are demanding deeper spending cuts.",
      "At the White House, Trump was hosting multiple meetings with holdouts and on-the-fence members, including members of the Freedom Caucus and the center-right Republican Main Street Caucus and Republican Governance Group.",
      "Later Wednesday, Freedom Caucus members and their allies gathered behind closed doors at the Capitol to discuss what they had heard from Trump. And there were indications the holdouts were beginning to soften their opposition.",
      "\"I always hear these reports about [Trump] raising his voice and cussing people, and it was nothing like that,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of the conservative holdouts. \"I wouldn't mind if my daughter had been in the room with us.\"",
      "He predicted a final vote would happen later Wednesday, as did other Republicans.",
      "Another holdout, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., called it a \"good meeting\" with Trump and said they \"found out a lot of new information.\"",
      "And Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, who was one of two Republicans to vote against the House's original version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" in May, said Wednesday he would support the revised version.",
      "Still, GOP leaders had not secured enough votes by early Wednesday evening. They kept a procedural vote open for more than four hours and sent lawmakers back to their offices as talks continued and some Republicans delayed by bad weather made their way to the Capitol.",
      "The bill must pass the House before Trump can sign it into law, and Johnson forced members back into town to try to meet Trump's self-imposed deadline of Friday.",
      "Within hours of its narrowly passing the Senate on Tuesday, House Republicans advanced the bill through the Rules Committee in a 7-6 vote, with Norman and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, voting \"no\" because of concerns that it would add to the debt.",
      "Before his White House meeting, Norman said he could not give an example of what would change his mind to vote for the package in his current form and made it clear he would not be swayed by promises of future legislation.",
      "\u201cThe only thing driving this is the tax cuts,\u201d Norman said. \u201cOnce that goes away, how are we going to get anything passed?\u201d",
      "The legislation would extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017 while boosting funding for immigration enforcement and the military. It would also make significant cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy funding while raising the debt limit by $5 trillion.",
      "The Senate-passed bill would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that the loss of revenue from tax cuts would outstrip the spending cuts in the legislation.",
      "Several House conservatives complained that the spending cuts were insufficient after the shrinking in the Senate package. They raged against the fact that various provisions were stripped out because budget rules in the Senate, including immigration-related restrictions they strongly support.",
      "Freedom Caucus leaders circulated a document Wednesday trashing the Senate bill for increasing the deficit and not going far enough on clean energy and Medicaid, among other grievances relative to the House-passed bill.",
      "But many of the House Republican holdouts have developed track records of folding and voting in alignment with Trump when the pressure is on them. GOP leaders are counting on them to do so again.",
      "One House Republican said conservatives in the Freedom Caucus used to get political cover from groups like the Club for Growth but that Trump has scrambled the calculus on the right. The Club for Growth is backing the bill, and conservative figures in Trump\u2019s inner circle, like Russell Vought and Stephen Miller, are some of the loudest cheerleaders for the package.",
      "Freedom Caucus members \u201chave no cover\u201d if they vote no, the lawmaker said Wednesday. \u201cWho\u2019s going to protect them from Trump? Thomas Massie?\u201d",
      "Trump has been in a bitter feud with the Massie, a conservative Republican congressman from Kentucky, threatening to recruit a primary challenger against him after he was one of just two Republicans to vote against the bill in the House in May. Massie, who walks around Capitol Hill wearing a live debt clock, has railed against the legislation and said it would make the deficit worse.",
      "And politically vulnerable Republicans were unhappy with the more aggressive Medicaid cuts in the Senate bill, along with a series of clean energy funding rollbacks that they warned against.",
      "On the Capitol steps Wednesday morning, Democrats blasted the legislation as a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, paid for by slashing programs that help the working class.",
      "\"It is the cruelest bill that I've ever seen in my tenure in the House of Representatives,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who has been in the House since 1988."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war risks reigniting next week when a temporary pause on sweeping tariffs is set to expire, potentially driving up costs for businesses and raising prices for consumers.",
      "While Trump and administration officials recently indicated the deadline might be pushed back, the president told reporters Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t planning an extension and is informing countries of their new tariff rates. He said it has been harder than planned to make trade deals with a number of foreign governments because they are \u201cspoiled from having ripped us off for 30, 40 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to determine a number just very simply, write them a nice letter,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One. \u201cProbably one page or a page and a half at the most, and it\u2019s going to be essentially, \u2018Congratulations. It\u2019s going to be an honor to allow you to go and do business in the United States of America,\u2019 because it really is an honor to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday that he had reached a trade agreement with Vietnam in which U.S.-based companies will have to pay a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on goods routed through Vietnam from other countries.  Vietnam agreed to not to charge any tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "'Liberation' delayed",
      "The tariffs, announced with great fanfare during an April event the White House dubbed \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d imposed levies on dozens of countries. They included a tariff of 24% on Japanese imports and a 20% tariff on products from the European Union. At the time, Trump said the duties would end decades of the U.S. being \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by trading partners.",
      "The move caused stocks to tumble, erasing as much as $5 trillion in value from the S&P 500, while global investors began to flee U.S. assets, increasing government borrowing costs. Just a week later, Trump said he was pausing most of those tariffs to give his administration time to broker new trade deals with as many as 75 trading partners in 90 days.",
      "White House officials framed the announcement and subsequent pause as a negotiating tactic and the \u201cart of the deal\u201d in action. But the $80 billion that customs officials estimate the U.S. has collected in additional tariff revenue during Trump\u2019s first six months pales beside the multitrillion-dollar gyration markets have undergone in that time.",
      "And nearly three months later, no trade agreements have been finalized. Talks continue with the U.S.\u2019 closest trading partners, and a framework for one agreement with the U.K. was reached, though details still need to be hammered out.",
      "Now, with the July 9 deadline approaching, U.S. businesses again face the threat of paying hefty levies on goods bought from overseas. Tariffs are taxes paid to the federal government by U.S.-based companies importing products or parts. Companies can then either absorb those fees, taking lower profits or cutting costs elsewhere, or pass those costs along to customers in the form of higher prices.",
      "'Tariff fatigue'",
      "The imposition of more tariffs could reignite the stock market volatility that the initial announcement caused \u2014 just as the S&P 500 recently recouped all of its losses since Trump returned to the White House. Investors largely expect him to extend the July 9 deadline for most trading partners and don\u2019t anticipate a major spike in tariff costs for companies in the coming days.",
      "\u201cDespite evidence of a \u2018tariff fatigue\u2019 among investors, trade policy concerns persist,\u201d Hussein Malik, head of global research at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients last week. \u201cWe believe that the upcoming July tariff deadline will be less critical,\u201d he said, but he noted that \u201cvolatility may continue until a final decision is reached this summer. The ability of corporations and consumers to absorb the tariff shocks will be critical in determining the macro consequences.\u201d",
      "Some tariffs have remained in place throughout the pause \u2014including a blanket 10% tariff on all imports and higher rates on steel, aluminum and autos. The United States and China announced a 90-day pause in May on most of their recent tariffs on each other, with the U.S. cutting its effective rate on Chinese imports to 30%, from 145%.",
      "So far, those tariffs haven\u2019t appeared to greatly disrupt the economy, but Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that more effects could emerge soon. Tariff uncertainty has caused the Fed to delay further interest rate cuts, he said, especially as inflation remains slightly above its preferred 2% target. And while many companies stocked up on inventory in the spring to prepare for tariffs, executives have warned that consumers could see higher prices this summer and fall as those supplies dwindle.",
      "Vietnam deal framework",
      "White House officials have said they are in regular talks with 18 of the U.S.\u2019 top trading partners, including the E.U., Japan and India, to negotiate trade deals.",
      "In touting the trade agreement Trump said the U.S. reached with Vietnam, Trump suggested that it could open up the Vietnamese market to American-made SUVs. Vietnam has been a growing trading parter for the U.S., but the buying power for most Vietnamese is limited with the average wage around $600 a month.",
      "\u201cWe will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on social media. \u201cIt is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.\u201d",
      "Trump didn't disclose any further details of the agreement. U.S. imports from Vietnam increased nearly 20% last year to $136.6 billion as more companies, like Nike, have been shifting production there from China to avoid paying the tariffs imposed on China during Trump's first term.",
      "Trump suggested Tuesday that a trade deal with India was also close, though administration officials have been suggesting that for weeks. Earlier, Trump had threatened India with a 26% tariff.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a deal where we\u2019re able to go in and compete,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cRight now, India doesn\u2019t accept anybody in. I think India is going to do that, and if they do that, we\u2019re going to have a deal for much less tariffs.\u201d",
      "Talks with Japan and the E.U.  drag on",
      "Trump said Tuesday that a deal with Japan was unlikely because the country wasn\u2019t willing to agree to buy enough U.S. rice, a move that could hurt Japanese farmers. Japan is already facing a 25% tariff on cars shipped to the U.S. and a reciprocal tariff of 24% if the tariff pause expires.",
      "The European Union\u2019s top trade negotiator was scheduled to come to Washington on Wednesday to continue talks. The E.U. has threatened to retaliate if there is no deal by July 9, with at least $100 billion worth of retaliatory tariffs on standby and plans to limit shipments to the U.S. of scrap steel and certain chemical products.",
      "White House officials have indicated they haven\u2019t had time to initiate serious trade talks with smaller trading partners, creating uncertainty around what would happen if the pause expires. While some of those countries sell a relatively small amount of goods to the U.S., they can dominate the supply of items in certain areas. Madagascar, for example, faces a 47% tariff once the pause expires and is the U.S.\u2019 main supplier of vanilla used in baking."

    "story": [
      "A new platform that encourages users to share information about sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents nearby rose to the top of the Apple App Store this week, amid criticism from Trump administration officials who say the app could put agents at risk.",
      "ICEBlock, which launched in April, made headlines after a CNN article about it was called out by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and ICE acting Director Todd M. Lyons on Monday. Both cited concerns over agent safety in their statements about the app, stating that \u201cagents are facing a 500% increase in assaults.\u201d",
      "But Joshua Aaron, ICEBlock\u2019s Texas-based developer, called the administration\u2019s recent criticism \u201canother right-wing fearmongering scare tactic,\u201d telling NBC News in a phone interview on Tuesday that his app was designed to be a resource for immigrants who are fearful they will get deported. He said he felt like he was \u201cwatching history repeat itself\u201d when he saw things like \u201c5-year-olds in courtrooms with no representation\u201d and \u201ccollege students being disappeared for their political opinions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I saw what was happening in this country, I really just wanted to do something to help fight back,\u201d said Aaron, a onetime musician who spent several months working on the app. \u201cI grew up in a Jewish household, and being part of the Jewish community, I had the chance to meet Holocaust survivors and learn the history of what happened in Nazi Germany, and the parallels that we can draw between what\u2019s happening right now in our country and Hitler\u2019s rise to power are undeniable.\u201d",
      "The app, which is free and gives users the ability to anonymously report ICE sightings within a five-mile radius, had approximately 95,200 users as of Monday, Aaron said. He said he has not received updated figures from Apple since the White House and ICE issued their comments on the app.",
      "ICEBlock is among several crowdsourcing platforms \u2014 including the website People Over Papers and the app ResistMap \u2014 that people across the U.S. have utilized to warn immigrants in their communities about ICE\u2019s whereabouts. Its popularity comes amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration. Raids \u2014 and subsequent protests in cities like Los Angeles \u2014 have become more widespread as ICE has ramped up its deportation of immigrants.",
      "The White House has stood by its policies, stating last month that President Donald Trump \u201cremains committed to enforcing federal immigration law \u2014 anyone present in the United States illegally is at risk of deportation.\u201d",
      "In Monday\u2019s White House briefing, Leavitt said she had not seen CNN\u2019s report about ICEBlock, but described the app as \u201cencouraging violence against law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our country safe.\u201d",
      "When asked for comment about ICEBlock, a spokesperson for ICE referred NBC News to Lyons\u2019 previous statement in which he called CNN\u2019s reporting \u201csickening,\u201d and said the app \u201cbasically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers\u2019 backs.\u201d He also expressed concern that covering the app could invite \u201cviolence against them with a national megaphone.\u201d",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also weighed in on Tuesday, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re working with the Department of Justice to see if we can prosecute them [CNN] for that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause what they\u2019re doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities, operations,\u201d she said while speaking to reporters alongside President Trump in Florida. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to actually go after them and prosecute them with the partnership of Pam if we can. Because what they\u2019re doing, we believe, is illegal.\u201d",
      "CNN did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "The network issued a statement on X in response to Noem and DHS, writing that ICEBlock \u201cis an app that is publicly available to any iPhone user who wants to download it. There is nothing illegal about reporting the existence of this or any other app, or does such reporting constitute promotion or other endorsement of the app by CNN.\u201d",
      "Aaron, the developer, also disputed the administration\u2019s claims about ICEBlock\u2019s causing harm.",
      "\u201cThis app is for informational purposes only, and I always like to say it is to inform, not obstruct,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking for people to be safe, to protect themselves and their communities.\u201d",
      "ICEBlock is available on iOS devices; it\u2019s also available in multiple languages and for vision- and hearing-impaired people.",
      "When users open the app, they are asked to allow notifications at all times so they can get real-time updates about their area. Once they agree, they are able to see a map of their location, and a list of any reported ICE sightings. If there are none, the app will say \u201cNo Sightings Reported.\u201d A person can report a sighting by pressing a plus sign and entering a specific address.",
      "\u201cModeled after Waze but for ICE sightings, the app ensures user privacy by storing no personal data, making it impossible to trace reports back to individual users,\u201d ICEBlock says on its website.",
      "Users can\u2019t make reports outside the five-mile radius where their phone is \u2014 a safeguard against false reporting \u2014 and all reports automatically expire after four hours. The app, which encourages users to \"see something, tap something,\u201d doesn\u2019t track any data beyond the number of users, according to Aaron.",
      "In the past week, ICEBlock has been promoted by many users on the social media platform BlueSky. Aaron said he\u2019s also seen some people post to X that the app has helped them avoid run-ins with ICE.",
      "Since ICEBlock has picked up more attention, Aaron said he has faced online harassment, such as people posting antisemitic comments about him on social media. But he said helping other people feel safer outweighs any negative responses.",
      "\u201cI think if you can save one person\u2019s life or help one person avoid a horrible situation, I\u2019ve done my job,\u201d he said."

      "The warehouse fire caused multiple spot fires, covering around 80 acres in total, Lawrence said.",
      "Investigators were also using drones to monitor the site Wednesday to assess any hazards, officials said.",
      "Esparto is a community of around 3,000, almost 30 miles northwest of Sacramento.",

    "summary": "A 2017 intelligence assessment found that Russia waged an information warfare campaign designed to boost Trump\u2019s prospects and damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 CIA officials failed in some cases to follow standard procedures in an intelligence analysis of Russian interference efforts in the 2016 election, according to an internal review declassified Wednesday.",
      "Intelligence officers were given an unusually short timeline for the analysis, there was \u201cexcessive involvement\u201d by senior leaders, and staff members were given uneven access to crucial intelligence about Russia, the \u201clessons-learned\u201d review said.",
      "But the review did not refute the findings of the 2017 intelligence assessment that Russia waged an information warfare campaign designed to undermine Americans\u2019 confidence in the electoral process, damage Hillary Clinton and boost Donald Trump\u2019s prospects in the 2016 election.",
      "\u201cWhile the overall assessment was deemed defensible, the identified procedural anomalies and tradecraft issues highlight critical lessons for handling controversial or politically charged topics,\u201d the review said.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump and his allies have long rejected intelligence and other reporting indicating that Russia employed false information and propaganda to try to influence the 2016 election and tip the scales in his favor. They have accused intelligence and law enforcement officials of plotting to tie Trump to Russia and cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory in 2016.",
      "A special counsel appointed during the first Trump administration looked extensively into how the CIA crafted its assessment but filed no criminal charges and reported no clear evidence that political bias tainted the process.",
      "A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation in 2020 concurred with the 2017 intelligence assessment and found no reason to dispute its conclusions.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second presidential term, his deputies have vowed to bring more transparency to the intelligence community and prevent any attempt to politicize its work.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe ordered the internal review this year and declassified it Wednesday, according to the CIA.",
      "The intelligence assessment of the 2016 vote, which President Barack Obama requested after the November election, found that Russia sought to undermine public faith in the democratic process and denigrate Clinton and that Moscow \u201caspired\u201d to help Trump win the election.",
      "Two senior leaders of a CIA mission center focusing on Russia objected to including the conclusion that Russia aimed to help secure Trump\u2019s victory, according to the internal review. They argued that the view was supported mainly by a single intelligence report while other judgments were backed up by more information.",
      "The review said the assessment was conducted on an unusually short timeline. Instead of having months to prepare a complex and politically sensitive analysis, the authors had \u201cless than a week to draft the assessment\u201d and \u201cless than two days to formally coordinate it\u201d with other intelligence officers.",
      "Multiple intelligence officers \u201csaid they felt \u2018jammed\u2019 by the compressed timeline,\u201d according to the review.",
      "The review said top CIA officials were heavily involved in the assessment effort, which \u201cwas highly unusual in both scope and intensity.\u201d As a result, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research were \u201centirely shut out\u201d of the analysis, which was a \u201csignificant deviation\u201d from standard practice in the intelligence community, according to the review.",
      "Authors of the 2016 assessment and other CIA officers also \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d including a reference in the analysis to the so-called Trump dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. The dossier included unverified allegations about Trump\u2019s colluding with Russia.",
      "In the end, a summary of the dossier was included in an annex, with a disclaimer that it was not used \u201cto reach the analytic conclusions\u201d in the assessment.",
      "The review also found reasons to praise the 2016 assessment, saying that much of the team\u2019s work showed \u201crobust\u201d tradecraft with extensive sourcing and that there was no sign of systemic problems.",
      "\u200b\u200bJohn Brennan, who was CIA director at the time of the assessment, told NBC News on Wednesday he was aware of the review but had not had a chance to read it yet."

      "DENVER \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday ended an order blocking the deportation of the family of the man charged in the fatal firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado, noting government lawyers say the man's relatives are not being rushed out of the country as the White House originally stated.",
      "Hayam El Gamal and her five children were detained by immigration agents on June 3, two days after her husband Mohamed Sabry Soliman was accused of throwing two Molotov cocktails at people demonstrating for awareness of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Prosecutors announced Monday that an 82-year-old woman who was injured in the attack had died.",
      "U.S. District Judge Orlando L. Garica dismissed the family's lawsuit challenging their detention by immigration authorities. The ruling noted that El Gamal and her children ages 4 to 18 are not eligible for expedited deportations because they have been in the country for over two years, which he said lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have acknowledged.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the U.S. illegally. He is being prosecuted in both state and federal court for the attack, which prosecutors say injured a total of 13 people. Investigators say he planned the attack for a year and was driven by a desire \"to kill all Zionist people.\" He has pleaded not guilty to federal hate crimes charges but hasn't been asked to enter a plea in the state case, which now includes a murder charge.",
      "On the day El Gamal and her children were arrested, the White House said in social media posts that they \"COULD BE DEPORTED AS EARLY AS TONIGHT\" and that six one-way tickets had been purchased for them, with their \"final boarding call coming soon.\" Those statements led a federal judge in Colorado to issue an emergency order temporarily blocking the family's deportation, Garcia said.",
      "The case was later transferred to Texas, where the family is being held in an immigration detention center for families. Garcia is based in San Antonio.",
      "Because the family is in regular deportation proceedings, there is no longer any reason to block their deportation, Garcia said. Regular proceedings can take months or even years if decisions are appealed. He also turned down the family's request to be released from the detention center in the meantime, saying they can pursue release through the normal bond process in the immigration system.",
      "Lawyers for the family had challenged their detention as unconstitutional because they said it was intended to punish them for Soliman's actions. According to a court filing by El Gamal's lawyers, one of the immigration agents who arrested them told her, \"You have to pay for the consequences of what you did.\"",
      "Garcia said immigration authorities have discretion in deciding who to detain and he did not have authority to review their decision to detain El Gamal and her children. Lawyers for the government said they are being lawfully held because they are accused of overstaying their visas.",
      "One of the family's attorneys, Niels Frenzen, said they hoped to get the family released from the detention center while the deportation proceedings continue.",
      "An email seeking comment from the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not immediately returned."

    "summary": "From Coco Gauff to Alexander Zverev, Wimbledon's first round saw many of the world's best tennis players lose. \"It's kind of shocking,\" one top player said.",
    "story": [
      "No one in women's tennis was better than Coco Gauff in early June.",
      "Standing on a clay court in Paris, Gauff, 21, lifted a silver trophy after she won the French Open, the second major championship of her career and the first time an American had won it since Serena Williams in 2015.",
      "Just three weeks later, chasing her second major title of the season, Gauff didn't even make it out of her opening match on the grass courts of Wimbledon. It was a stunning result \u2014 all the more because it wasn't an outlier.",
      "In all, 23 seeded men and women were beaten in Wimbledon's first round, the most since the current seeding format began in 2001. In addition to Gauff, who entered with the second-highest seeding, third-seeded Jessica Pegula lost in the women's singles draw. It was the first time since 1968 \u2014 a turning point in the sport's history when professionals began competing alongside amateurs at major tournaments \u2014 that two of the top three women's seeds had been knocked out during the first round of a Grand Slam tournament.",
      "\u201cThis is why tennis is the best reality show on Earth,\u201d former U.S. Open champion Andy Roddick said on his podcast Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no script.\u201d",
      "Thirteen seeded men lost in the first round, tying a record at Grand Slams, the sport's four most prestigious tournaments. Carlos Alcaraz, 22, the Spanish superstar who entered Wimbledon as a two-time defending champion but needed the full five sets to survive his opening match, recited that statistic a day later after he advanced out of the second round.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking,\u201d Alcaraz said. \"Everything can happen in tennis, even in the first round.\"",
      "Like Alcaraz, another past champion, seven-time winner Novak Djokovic, remains alive in the men's singles bracket. But their competition has been thinned out. Among those to lose in the first round were third-seeded Alexander Zverev, seventh-seeded Lorenzo Musetti and ninth-seeded Daniil Medvedev, a former No. 1-ranked player and U.S. Open champion.",
      "Asked about the string of upsets, Zverev didn't see a throughline that connected his match with the losses of Musetti, Medvedev and others.",
      "\"I don't think tennis is the problem right now for me,\" Zverev said after he lost to an opponent who had been just 8-17 this season. \"It's something else that I have to find within me at the moment.\"",
      "Yet Roddick, who described the scale of the upsets as \"carnage,\" and Gauff both left the opening rounds with theories for why Wimbledon's draw had become so riddled with upsets that centered on style and timing.",
      "\"I would say the quick turnaround,\" Gauff said after her first-round exit. \"I think most of the seeds are going deeper in Roland Garros, and then you spend a long clay season and then you have to come and adjust to grass.\u201d",
      "In the annual tennis calendar, tournaments played on grass are outliers. That leaves relatively little time to get comfortable for playing on the surface, where the ball bounces lower and moves slower, before Wimbledon arrives. Yet how to best prepare for Wimbledon opens up another wrinkle for players who must decide whether to rest up or play the week before in other tune-up tournaments on grass and risk fatigue.",

      "\"It\u2019s a tricky thing, and it seems like Carlos and Novak are the ones to figure it out, and even [Alcaraz] had a tough first-round match,\" Gauff said. \"I really just think it\u2019s that this turnaround, I think, this Slam, out of all of them, is ... the most prone to have upsets just because of how quick the turnaround is from clay.\"",
      "Though Gauff's playing style isn\u2019t particularly suited for success on grass, Roddick said on his podcast, Pegula's loss was \"most shocking\" because hers is. Pegula's quick exit at Wimbledon came only three days after she had won another grass-court tournament in Germany that was seen as a warmup for Wimbledon.",
      "\"This is what happens when you actually play tournaments outside of the monosurface, where it\u2019s all kind of the same,\" Roddick said. \"You allow different styles in. ... This is what we get. We don\u2019t get a six-week lead-in where we\u2019re getting a data set from [tournaments in] Monte Carlo through Geneva that matter in predictions and knowing what\u2019s going on.",
      "\"I would say there are fewer people that know what they\u2019re doing on grass, like really, really know what they\u2019re doing, than on any other surface.\""

    "summary": "PhD student Job Garcia was tackled by agents, arrested and held in detention after filming an immigration raid at Home Depot, according to the legal group MALDEF.",
    "story": [
      "The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund is demanding the federal government pay $1 million in damages to a U.S. citizen who was arrested and detained while he was recording an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles last month.",
      "MALDEF put the government on notice of a coming civil lawsuit for what it says were assault, battery, false arrest and false imprisonment against Job Garcia, 37.",
      "Garcia, a Ph.D. student and photographer, was tackled and thrown to the ground by agents in the Home Depot parking lot in Hollywood, arrested and held for more than 24 hours, MALDEF said.",
      "It said Wednesday that it submitted the claim against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Border Patrol and other Department of Homeland Security agencies involved in Garcia's arrest.",
      "MALDEF also said that Garcia's arrest and detention were racially motivated and that the government agents may have violated his constitutional protections for free speech, his right to remain silent, his freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and his right to due process.",
      "MALDEF said the claim is a required administrative step before it files a lawsuit against the Border Patrol, ICE and the other DHS agencies.",
      "\"The Border Patrol and ICE agents unlawfully restrained and detained Mr. Garcia for more than 24 hours without any valid grounds for interfering with his liberty and freedom of movement and they did so based on legally prohibited grounds,\" MALDEF said in its claim letter, dated Tuesday. MALDEF said he was released without arraignment or notification of a future court date.",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Garcia assaulted and verbally harassed a federal agent and that he was subdued and arrested for the alleged assault. She repeated Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's warning that anyone who lays a hand on a law enforcement officer will be fully prosecuted.",
      "Ernest Herrera, MALDEF's Western regional counsel, said the claim sends a message to the federal government about punishing people for exercising their First Amendment rights \"and for hurting bystanders and protesters, whether they be U.S. citizens or not during these raids that are happening in public places.\"",
      "Garcia regularly traveled to Los Angeles-area Home Depots for his job as a delivery driver for an online business. He and others saw agents making the arrests and started recording them on his smartphone, MALDEF said.",
      "When Customs and Border Patrol agents surrounded a commercial light truck, he and other bystanders yelled to the driver not to open his door or window and to keep silent, according to MALDEF.",
      "\"All individuals that Border Patrol agents had detained up to this point appeared to be Latino or Latin American national origin. The driver of the light commercial truck also appeared to be Latino or of Latin American national origin,\" it said.",
      "MALDEF said a masked agent lunged at Garcia and tried to grab his phone, leading him to move backward. The agent who had lunged at him threw Garcia's phone to the ground and tackled him. Other agents joined in, restraining him with their knees in his back and pressing his face into the asphalt, even though he did not resist, MALDEF said.",
      "\"Mr. Garcia felt that his breathing was restricted and momentarily feared that he may be killed in this position,\" the claim says. An agent transferring Garcia tried to speak to him in Spanish \"and was surprised when Mr. Garcia responded in English\" but continued to try to speak Spanish to him.",
      "Garcia was taken to Dodger Stadium in handcuffs. By that time, agents had confirmed that he was a citizen with no criminal warrants and that there was no information to suspect he had committed a crime, MALDEF said.",
      "\"During this time, Garcia said he heard the agents boasting about how many 'bodies' they had gotten that day and saw them celebrate with high-fives,\" it said.",
      "The claim also sends a message that \u201cthe American public does not approve of this sort of immigration enforcement action where people are terrorized, where certain people are targeted and agents themselves are bragging about how many bodies they got,\u201d Herrera said.",
      "Agents tried to interrogate Garcia after they read him his rights, MALDEF said. He refused to answer questions and was not read his rights when later attempts were made to interrogate him, it said. He was transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles and released the next day, without arraignment or any information about a future court date, MALDEF said.",
      "\"Border Patrol and ICE punished me for informing others of their rights and exercising my own rights,\" Garcia said in the MALDEF statement.",
      "MALDEF said Garcia sustained bruising on his back, neck, arms, face and legs from the tackling and restraint, that he is suffering emotional distress and that he lost out on more than four days of delivery work, costing him $2,500 to $3,000.",
      "He also has stopped his academic work because of emotional distress and might not complete his program in a year, as expected, MALDEF said.",
      "\u201cWhen government engages in widespread violation of individual rights with respect to immigrants without status, the harm inevitably spills over and spreads to others; that is why we must insist, as a society, on respect for the rights of everyone,\u201d Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF's president and general counsel, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cHere, a citizen, acting in the best traditions of our democracy, was engaged in documenting government misconduct to encourage policy change; he was wrongfully arrested and detained because of his race and his heroic efforts,\u201d Saenz said."

      "Zoltan Hargitay had been pondering what to do with the sinks before deciding his sister should have them.",

      "Reminiscing on his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d hosting gig in March 2023, Kelce said that while he felt \u201cso much more comfortable\u201d doing comedy, he still felt nervous and was concerned that he wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.",
      "Kelce remembered thinking, \u201c\u2018I want to take advantage of this, like, I want to have fun doing it but I don\u2019t want to look like a loser doing this. I want to make them respect my approach and how I\u2019m taking it serious.\u201d",
      "Calling the rehearsals leading up to the show \u201ca crazy ride\u201d and \u201cjust a fun rollercoaster,\u201d he explained that he was at Rockefeller Center preparing all week until 2 or 3 a.m. every day.",

      "In 2024, Kelce took on his first \u201cserious\u201d acting role as Eddie Lachlan in Ryan Murphy\u2019s show \u201cGrotesquerie.\u201d While he credited the \u201creally good cast\u201d for showing him the ropes, he said he felt out of his comfort zone \u201cpreparation wise.\u201d",

      "Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio heralded the demise of the U.S. Agency for International Development this week after more than 60 years. He wrote on Substack: \u201cUSAID has little to show since the end of the Cold War. Development objectives have rarely been met, instability has often worsened, and anti-American sentiment has only grown.\u201d",
      "That would be news to the volunteer doctors and other relief workers I have met in Darfur, Chad and refugee camps throughout the Middle East. According to a study released this week by The Lancet, a British medical journal, USAID funding is credited with saving more than 90 million lives in the last 20 years, including a 65% reduction in mortality from HIV/AIDS, 51% from malaria and 50% from neglected tropical diseases.",
      "Rubio wrote: \u201cForeign assistance programs that align with administration policies \u2014 and which advance American interests \u2014 will be administered by the State Department, where they will be delivered with more accountability, strategy, and efficiency.\u201d",
      "Created in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID had as many as 15,000 staffers administering contracts to organizations in 133 countries and territories. It is expected that the staff of the new division will be far smaller.  The reductions are in addition to a proposed 15% cut in the State Department\u2019s domestic staff of foreign service officers and civil servants set to take place within days.",
      "Much of USAID\u2019s success in saving 25 million lives from HIV/AIDS, acknowledged by bipartisan majorities in Congress, is credited to PEPFAR, a program launched by former President George W. Bush with support from U2 front man and public health advocate Bono, the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.",
      "Marking the end of America\u2019s global foreign aid commitment this week, Bush issued a video message obtained by The New York Times telling the USAID staff, \u201cIs it in our interest that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is. On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for your hard work and God bless you.\u201d Bono was more poetic in his video lament. \u201cIt\u2019s not left-wing rhetoric to feed the hungry, heal the sick,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t murder, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d",
      "Rubio announced today that a dozen U.S. foreign aid agencies will be rebranded under an American flag insignia.

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-verdict-blow-federal-prosecutors-analysts-say-rcna216573",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 21:17:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The jury in Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial ultimately rejected prosecutors\u2019 assertion that the hip-hop mogul ran a racketeering and sex-trafficking scheme.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. government prosecutors repeatedly told jurors that Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was the ruthless ringleader of a criminal conspiracy, the key figure in a sprawling racketeering and sex trafficking scheme. Combs must be convicted on all five criminal counts, the prosecutors argued, and only then can justice be served.",
      "In the end, the jury was not convinced.",
      "The panel of 12 New Yorkers returned a mixed verdict at the climax of Combs\u2019 federal trial Wednesday, convicting the music mogul on two interstate prostitution counts but acquitting him on the vastly more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, which each carried a maximum prison sentence of life behind bars.",
      "In interviews, legal analysts and former federal prosecutors said the verdict was a blow to the Southern District of New York, which spent seven weeks unwinding an expansive narrative, introducing reams of graphic evidence and calling more than 30 witnesses to the stand. In contrast, the defense team did not call a single witness.",
      "\u201cThis trial was a major gamble, and Combs won that bet,\u201d said Anna Cominsky, an associate professor of law and the director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School. \u201cEverything is stacked against the defendant going into a federal case, in particular one like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis attorneys were smart and they owned the bad facts,\u201d Cominsky added. \u201cThey fought on the things that mattered, and it paid off.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 defense team never disputed their client\u2019s history of domestic violence \u2014 including his physical assault of ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. They also readily acknowledged that Combs arranged drug-dazed, marathon sexual encounters in luxury hotels called \u201cfreak offs.\u201d",
      "But the rapper\u2019s lawyers always insisted that Ventura and another ex-girlfriend, identified in court under the pseudonym \u201cJane,\u201d willingly participated in freak offs. The lawyers highlighted text messages in which both women expressed romantic affection for Combs and sometimes conveyed enthusiasm for their \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "In acquitting Combs of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, jurors effectively rejected the prosecution\u2019s assertion that the music mogul oversaw a criminal enterprise encompassing sex trafficking, forced labor, drug distribution and other acts to fulfill his sexual desires. They may have been persuaded by the defense team\u2019s characterization of Combs as a \u201cswinger\u201d who had been unfairly persecuted for his lifestyle.",
      "In sometimes sarcastic closing arguments last week, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said the case against his client was \u201cbadly exaggerated.\u201d Jeffrey Harris, a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, said jurors might have agreed that the prosecution\u2019s case was overwrought from the start.",
      "\u201cJuries expect more from prosecutors than they do from defense attorneys,\u201d Harris said, \u201cand when prosecutors lose credibility by over-charging it usually does not end well.\u201d",
      "Berit Berger, a former federal prosecutor in both the Southern  and Eastern Districts of New York, disagreed with the suggestion that prosecutors had over-charged Combs, but acknowledged that the defense team may have been successful in puncturing the government\u2019s narrative, especially when it came to the question of consent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that when there\u2019s an acquittal on some counts, but I do think that they [prosecutors] presented evidence that met the legal elements for each of these statutes,\u201d Berger said. \u201cI think the defense really wanted to paint this as a situation where grown women had agency, and could have left this relationship at any time, and they chose to stay, because there were benefits to that.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy guess is that resonated with some of the jurors,\u201d Berger added.",
      "In an interview, another former Justice Department prosecutor said the Combs verdict was a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the office, adding that juries can get hung up on the technical elements in large racketeering conspiracy cases outside of the typical mafia and gang conduct. The jurors in Combs\u2019 case were asked whether prosecutors had proved he had been involved in underlying racketeering acts such as kidnapping, arson and bribery.",
      "\u201cIn those traditional contexts, witnesses can tell you why it all relates to the charged enterprise,\u201d said the former federal prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to express candid views. \u201cWithout that narrator from inside the enterprise or clear explicit ties, it is very hard.\u201d",
      "The former prosecutor said they were curious what a judge would do in post-trial motions, saying a judge could still sentence Combs severely if moved by the evidence, noting that the statutory maximum on each of the two counts he was convicted of is 10 years in prison.",
      "Misty Marris, a defense attorney and legal analyst, said the prosecutors ultimately failed to provide a robust explanation of how Combs\u2019 alleged criminal enterprise worked.",
      "\u201cThey never established what the criminal enterprise was, its purpose, how it operated, who was really involved in it,\u201d Marris said. \u201cThat really never gelled for me, and clearly the jury agreed.\u201d",
      "Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ricky J. Patel, the special agent in charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations, did not directly address the outcome in a statement released after the verdict.",
      "\u201cSex crimes deeply scar victims, and the disturbing reality is that sex crimes are all too present in many aspects of our society,\u201d Clayton and Patel said. \u201cVictims endure gut-wrenching physical and mental abuse, leading to lasting trauma. New Yorkers and all Americans want this scourge stopped and perpetrators brought to justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cProsecuting sex crimes requires brave victims to come forward and tell their harrowing stories,\u201d they added. \u201cWe and our law enforcement partners recognize the hardships victims endure and have prioritized a victim-centered approach to investigating and prosecuting these cases.\u201d",
      "When the verdict was being read inside the courtroom this morning, Combs got on his knees and prayed. The prosecutors remained seated, subdued and by all appearances despondent."

      "\"Jurassic World's\" breakout star tucks into a backpack and chomps on licorice with her tiny teeth. Her name is Dolores, and she\u2019s quickly become the soft spot of \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d",
      "When the film made its theatrical debut on July 2, audiences encountered a dinosaur not yet seen before in the franchise: an Aquilops, brought to life not only by special effects but also by an animatronic figure.",
      "In the six previous entries of the \u201cJurassic\u201d franchise, moviegoers learned to brace for colossal carnivores, bone-rattling reptile rumbles and bloody-slicked jungle terrain. But Dolores' big eyes and playful energy likens her more to a pet than a predator.",
      "In a June 26 behind-the-scenes featurette, actor Rupert Friend, who portrays Martin Krebs, described Dolores as \u201cadorable,\u201d adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite character in the film. She's probably mine.\"",
      "Similar affection for the dinosaur was extended when she appeared on TODAY June 25 alongside co-star Scarlett Johansson, who goaded co-anchor Craig Melvin into giving her a kiss.",
      "\"She's a diva,\" Johansson gushed, adding. \"Give Dolores a kiss!\"",
      "She might be an animatronic, but she certainly appeared real enough to Craig, who hesitated several times before finally plopping a kiss on her head.",
      "\"She is sweet, not as sweet as you,\" Craig told Johansson.",
      "What Kind of Dinosaur Is Dolores?",
      "Dolores is an Aquilops who made her feature debut in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d She strikes a connection with the film\u2019s character Isabella (played by Audrina Miranda), whom the dinosaur comforts when Isabella is frightened.",
      "\u201cThe reason why our relationship is so good in the movie is because I was scared and she just happened to crawl along and help me,\u201d explains Miranda in the behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "Isabella eventually learns that Dolores isn\u2019t like the dangerous teeth-gnashing dinosaurs on the island. Instead, Dolores enjoys licorice and is up for being carried around in Isabella\u2019s backpack.",
      "David Iacono, who portrays Xavier in the film, describes her in the featurette as a \u201cfun-loving puppy.\u201d",
      "How Big Was Aquilops?",
      "When Aquilops, who inspired Dolores, existed more than 100 million years ago, it was believed to be nearly two feet long according to the Sam Noble Museum at the University of Oklahoma. Or, roughly the size of a small cat!",
      "How Was Dolores Brought to Life in \u2018Jurassic World Rebirth\u2019?",
      "Instead of being created solely through CGI, special effects artists brought Dolores to life in an animatronic form, according to NBC Insider. The Dolores puppet was operated via radio controllers, capable of making the dinosaur blink and move her head, body, jaw and tail.",
      "As a result, Dolores didn't just feel real on screen. According to the film\u2019s director, Gareth Edwards, Dolores' cuteness factor meant it was hard to tear the cast and crew away from her.",
      "\"The days we had the Aquilops on set were very long days because people wouldn't go home,\" Edwards explains. \"They would stop and they'd want to pet her.\""

      "Britney, 27, a registered nurse and an entrepreneur, gave her longtime partner of five years, AJ, 28, the ultimatum. She believed AJ wasn\u2019t committed to the idea of marriage, while AJ thought she became a second fiddle to Britney\u2019s business.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Britney shares that she used to watch \"The Ultimatum\" and couldn't understand why anyone would give their partner an ultimatum. Then she changed her mind.",
      "\u201cI saw the value in it when I started to apply it to my own relationship. Those were our everyday conversations. So you don\u2019t take a risk, then you don\u2019t get a reward,\" she says.",
      "After their three-week trial marriage to their respective partners \u2014 AJ with Marie Robertson and Britney with Marita Prodger \u2014 ended, the two say the grew.",
      "Here's what came next, in AJ and Britney's own words.",
      "Do AJ and Britney get engaged in the finale?",
      "In the finale, AJ popped the question to Britney.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning of our relationship and until now, you\u2019ve blown me away. I\u2019ve never had a love like you,\u201d Britney said on the show.",
      "Their relationship is still going strong. So much so that while speaking to TODAY in an interview, AJ says, \u201cTell her I love her and tell her I said hi.\"",
      "Discussing Ultimatum Day, AJ says proposing was an easy choice.",
      "\u201cIt just even made it more special, having that moment with her. And I can\u2019t wait to see it again,\u201d AJ tells TODAY.com. \u201cI probably watched it 30,000 times in the hotel, but I can\u2019t wait to watch it again and just know that our love is literally there for any time that we want to relive that.\u201d",
      "In the reunion, AJ also upgraded Britney\u2019s ring with a shinier flair.  \u201cI had to make sure she got right because the ring I got her before wasn\u2019t what she needed to be,\u201d she says.",
      "Britney is very enthusiastic about the episodes dropping, so she can freely share the news.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have to hide that I was gone for two months in Miami and that I was on a show, and then that me and AJ are in this relationship and having to worry about posting each other,\u201d Britney shares with TODAY.com. \u201cI am just happy to be authentically myself.\u201d",
      "What is Marita and Britney\u2019s relationship like now?",
      "Marita and Britney are still very close friends after their trial marriage.",
      "With Marita, Britney learned about having a work-life balance and to become much calmer when stressful things arise.",
      "\u201cI think her just being so calm and also yet so positive and radiant, it helped me not to overthink and spiral and also not only be busy, but get upset or frustrated with being busy,\u201d Britney tells TODAY. \u201cI think it allowed me to take a deep breath and just know that everything\u2019s going to be OK, and that allowed me to be more calm with my decision-making and how I plan out my day.\u201d",
      "AJ shares that Marita was her biggest cheerleader in her proposal. In the reunion, they shout her out for help, reassuring AJ that Britney\u2019s love for her will come before her business.",
      "AJ jokes that she was shocked Britney cooked Marita oxtail.",
      "\u201cOxtails are expensive. They are a delicacy. They are rare. It is hard,\u201d AJ tells TODAY. \u201cYou do not cook any woman oxtail. You just don\u2019t do it. So to watch it and then for Marita to say, \u2018Yeah, she cooked me oxtail,\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018All right. Now I\u2019ve got to be the bad guy.\u2019 It could have been chicken or fettuccine Alfredo!\u201d",
      "According to Britney, her cooking also had some of the producers\u2019 bellies rumbling.",
      "\u201cLowkey they were like, yo, are they going to finish that?\u201d Britney reveals. \u201cAnd I shared it. I\u2019m like, please take it. I had a whole pot. I was like, \u2018Please take it.\u2019\u201d",
      "What is AJ and Marie\u2019s relationship like now?",
      "Unlike Britney and Marita, AJ and Marie didn\u2019t stay close after their trial marriage. \u201cAJ did best that AJ could,\u201d Marie said in the reunion.",
      "AJ, on her end, wishes they were able to stay close.",
      "\u201cI think our dynamic shifted because she was starting to receive a different response from her ex. She wanted what, at the time, me and Brittany shared \u2014 mutual respect,\u201d AJ says in her interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fault her for that because I would be just as devastated or raising bloody hell if Britney didn\u2019t speak to me in the hallways.\u201d"

      "While Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been known to make touchdowns on the field, he\u2019s been trying his luck at scoring off the field in the world of acting.",
      "Appearing on a July 1 episode of \"Bussin' With The Boys,\" a podcast hosted by former NFL players Will Compton and Taylor Lewan, Kelce opened up about breaking into the acting world and some of its challenges.",
      "Reminiscing on his \"Saturday Night Live\" hosting gig in March 2023, Kelce said that while he felt \"so much more comfortable\" doing comedy, he still felt nervous and was concerned that he wouldn't be taken seriously.",
      "Kelce remembered thinking, \u201c\u2018I want to take advantage of this, like, I want to have fun doing it but I don\u2019t want to look like a loser doing this. I want to make them respect my approach and how I\u2019m taking it serious.\u201d",
      "Calling the rehearsals leading up to the show \u201ca crazy ride\u201d and \u201cjust a fun rollercoaster,\u201d he explained that he was at Rockefeller Center preparing all week until 2 or 3 a.m. every day.",
      "When asked about the \u201cSNL\u201d writers\u2019 rooms, Kelce called them \u201cfun because you\u2019re just getting pitched ideas.\u201d But when it came time for the table read, the football star called the experience the \u201chardest f---ing part\u201d about being on the show.",
      "\"The table reading \u2014 for a guy that can\u2019t really read that well \u2014 it was kind of a f--- situation,\" he said. \"I felt like I was just trying to get through the reading instead of actually acting it out and giving it a voice and giving it a character, things like that.\"",
      "\u201cI was just focused on, \u2018Don\u2019t f------ skip this line,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "Lewan admitted similar troubles, telling Kelce, \u201cBrother, when it comes to reading difficulties, I will be on that side of the aisle with you my entire life.\u201d",
      "When Kelce added that he considers himself \u201cmore of an audio guy,\u201d Lewan joked, \u201cThat\u2019s why they make audio books now, for guys like us.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018You reading?\u2019 I\u2019m listening. I\u2019m listening quite a bit, actually,\u201d Lewan said as Kelce laughed.",
      "Earlier in the interview, Kelce touched on his \"fun cameo\" in Adam Sandler's upcoming sequel, \"Happy Gilmore 2,\" which is set to hit theaters July 25.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I see myself kind of focusing, like those fun cameos,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201clike in \u2018Happy Gilmore,\u2019 I\u2019m a waiter. Like a fun a-- f------ role in a movie with a guy, Adam Sandler, who I\u2019ve loved my entire life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d kill to do movies like that for the rest of my life,\u201d Kelce said of the new film.",
      "Despite his recent list of acting credits, including \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d Kelce admitted that acting is a field he\u2019s not \u201ccomfortable in yet, especially enough to do serious stuff,\u201d telling the podcast hosts that he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel like I\u2019ve grasped the acting world yet.\u201d",
      "In 2024, Kelce took on his first \"serious\" acting role as Eddie Lachlan in Ryan Murphy's show \u201cGrotesquerie.\u201d While he credited the \"really good cast\" for showing him the ropes, he said he felt out of his comfort zone \"preparation wise.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so prepared for an NFL game,\u201d Kelce explained. \u201cIn my career field, I get an entire week to figure out a scheme, how I\u2019m going to attack somebody, how I\u2019m going to handle certain specific situations. And when you go into acting, it\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t feel as prepared.\u201d",
      "The Super Bowl champion says he wishes acting had a similar approach to his on-field plays, saying, \u201cEvery single director I\u2019ve met on scenes, I\u2019m just like, \u2018Coach me up. I\u2019m here to be coached. If I suck, tell me I suck. Tell me how I can be better. I\u2019ll take all the criticism, I don\u2019t give a f---.\u2019\u201d"

      "Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Bear\u201d Season 4.",
      "So, did Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and the rest of the crew get that Michelin star, or what? Well, the answer, like all things \u201cThe Bear,\u201d is equal parts heartwarming, soul-stirring and frustratingly chaotic.",
      "Before Season 4 dropped, Tina (Lisa Col\u00f3n-Zayas) visited TODAY with Jenna and Friends and said that the season goes \u201cmuch deeper\u201d with the themes of \u201cpersonal responsibility and reckoning,\u201d guaranteeing more of the show\u2019s heightened restaurant-kitchen anxiety that is now a trademark of the show.",
      "\u201cDoomsday could be coming,\u201d she said in a spoiler-free preview, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is, because I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d",
      "On June 25, all 10 episodes of Season 4 dropped on Hulu/FX, and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve binged every moment in rapid succession, much like sandwich orders coming through the gang\u2019s long-abandoned ticket machine.",
      "Now we know what Col\u00f3n-Zayas meant: the future could be doomsday, or it could be exactly what all of our characters \u2014 especially Carmine \u201cCarmy\u201d Berzatto \u2014  need to survive and finally thrive.",
      "We\u2019ve reached the end of another season full of marinara and mayhem, and here\u2019s where our main players stand after Episode 10, \u201cGoodbye.\u201d",
      "Sydney now knows Carmy\u2019s plans",
      "The episode opens on Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) resting her head against a fence in obvious frustration behind the restaurant. The following half hour and change is what is called a bottle episode, in that it unfolds on one set. Just like the tension that follows, the entire episode stews in this alleyway amongst the dumpsters.",
      "Carmy enters and notes that Syd has pretty much ignored him all night.",
      "\u201cYou good?\u201d Carmy asks. (No, she is not good.)",
      "At the end of Episode 9, after we find out Marcus has won Best New Chef from Food and Wine, Sydney finally found out from Pete (Chris Witaske) the exact terms of the updated partnership agreement she has avoided signing this season. Carmy wants to sign away his ownership of the restaurant, turning over The Bear to Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt), Natalie \u201cSugar\u201d (Abby Elliott) and Syd.",
      "As one would expect, Syd feels blind-sided, particularly after choosing her love for The Bear over her partnership with Adam Shapiro in Episode 8. Now, she\u2019s ready to hash things out with Carmy.",
      "Yes, Carmy does actually want to leave The Bear",
      "It seems almost unbelievable that, after all this effort and at such a crucial time for the health of this very family-oriented business, that the restaurant's main driving Berzatto would want to leave, but there have been clues into Carmy's intentions all season.",
      "First is Carmy\u2019s actual efforts to heal some wounds, especially with Claire (Molly Gordon), his on-and-off (and maybe on again) girlfriend he fell out with thanks to a locked walk-in \u2014 and truly cruel admission \u2014 at the end of Season 2. He\u2019s also timidly starting talking to his mother Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis) again.",
      "Also, he\u2019s seemed distant all season long; changes to the menu that would normally set this character on a roller coaster of screams and epithets were met with an eerie calm.",
      "When he had no notes for Syd\u2019s scallop dish, it felt like his work mentoring her was done \u2014 but neither her nor the audience picked up on it until now.",
      "Sydney and Carmy fight over The Bear's future",
      "\u201cCan I actually just not hear you talk for one f---ing second?\u201d Syd says as she attempts to smoke a cigarette, something our white t-shirted hero points out she does not usually do. She takes a trembling drag anyway.",
      "Carmy tries to explain his thinking behind leaving the restaurant. First, he plans on staying on until the restaurant is financially viable, something it is very much isn\u2019t at this juncture.",
      "Nearly 1,440 hours \u2014 or two months \u2014 have passed on the clock Uncle Jimmy set up to show when he would stop funneling money into the restaurant, leading its employees to subsist solely on profit, which we\u2019ve repeatedly been shown does not exist.",
      "The chaos \u2014 both in action and the recently-shelved chaos menu of old \u2014 has led to the debt, in Carmy\u2019s opinion.",

      "Richie is shocked at Carmy \u201cretiring,\u201d saying he\u2019s \u201cf---ing 12,\u201d and accusing him of being on drugs. This whole season, Richie has been dealing with his feelings about belonging: his acceptance of another father figure in his young daughter\u2019s life, mistakes he\u2019s made at work and his efforts to grow.",
      "They fight and Carmy blurts out that he went to his brother Mikey\u2019s (Jon Bernthal) funeral \u2014 everyone thought he had skipped it, but the audience found out that he did when Uncle Lee (Bob Odenkirk) said he saw him earlier in the season.",
      "Carmy and Richie have a heart to heart: Richie thought Carmy wasn\u2019t at the funeral out of anger and resentment at him for not figuring Mikey out. Carmy says that he was actually jealous of Richie and Mikey\u2019s relationship.",
      "\u201cYou were like, inside my family,\u201d Carmy says.",
      "Richie also admits he resented Carmy for his abilities, even disclosing that he purchased a fine dining cookbook, \u201cThe French Laundry\u201d written by Season 3 cameo\u2019s Thomas Keller. Carmy is impressed, even though Richie calls the book \u201cdemented,\u201d and after a beat, the main reason of this shocking departure is succinctly explained.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m like, Richie,\u201d Carmy says. \u201cLike, outside of the kitchen.\u201d",

      "Richie doesn\u2019t believe it at first, thinking it was just a kind gesture, but Syd is serious, saying it\u2019s what she needs and Carmy accepts the update to the updated terms.",
      "\u201cF--- yes, Chef Sydney, it is a f---ing honor,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my official capacity as partner, I do have one question though, how the f--- do we keep this place open?\u201d",
      "Sugar then enters, and Richie tells her that Carmy went to Mikey\u2019s funeral. Rather than yell like everyone else, she wordlessly hugs her brother, bursting into tears. Cut to the empty restaurant, where the clock ticks away to zero.",
      "It\u2019s been an emotional rollercoaster with these four, who all delivered performances in this episode we'll likely see clipped come next Emmy awards season.",
      "FX has renewed \"The Bear\" for a fifth season, so Syd, Carmy, Richie and Sugar will leave that alleyway soon enough toward an uncertain future. Just like our sweet, swearing and sweaty faves, though, we\u2019re just going to have to live in tension until those episodes drop."

      "\u201cEva\u2019s been a dear friend for years and I am so pleased we found an opportunity to work together,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat originally was meant as a guest star arc turned into a longer and more satisfying arc, in thanks to Eva\u2019s terrific work and chemistry with our cast. I was thrilled Eva was available to us in this extended role. I wish her all the best in her upcoming projects.\u201d",

      "Playing a villain was \"hard\" for LaRue, who explained that soap opera viewers are hard core fans of their shows.",
      "\"The GH fans couldn\u2019t stand (Natalia)! So that was tough, because especially if you are accustomed to being rooted for, to be rooted against is not as comfortable,\u201d she said.",

      "Who Are Huda and Jeremiah, and What Happened With Them on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "So how involved are you on the production side of things? Do you get to decide when new bombshells are coming in, when to change up the rules for Casa, like we did this year?",
      "No, I just hear about things maybe a couple days beforehand. Or, you know, of course, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s planned way in advance, I\u2019ll hear about it, and I can say, \u201cWow, I love that.\u201d Or, \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not in charge.",
      "Let\u2019s talk about Nic and Olandria. Do you think we\u2019ll be seeing a return of them later this season? I know on \u201cAftersun,\u201d you mentioned that you saw some chemistry between them.",
      "Yeah, I think the chemistry, when you watch that kiss in Soul Ties, was palpable from watching it on the screen. When they said that they didn\u2019t feel any sparks, I was very confused because I feel like I saw sparks. That being said, you know, I think, honestly, I just want both of them to find whatever it is that they\u2019re looking for. And I\u2019m so happy that whatever it took to get Olandria a little bit away from thinking about Taylor, I think is a positive.",
      "I mean, that being said, I love Cierra and Nic together, so I don\u2019t want to speak ill of that relationship, because I think that is a really good relationship, too. But you know, who knows? You never know what\u2019s going to happen day to day in that villa. Things happen so fast.",
      "What do you think about some of the other couples on the show, like Chelley and Ace, and Zak and Amaya?",
      "I mean, I feel like Chelley and Ace, they took so long to actually couple up, which was interesting, because I felt like they had had this flirtation for so long, but you know, watching the episode with the heart-rate challenge, you see that Chelley still wants to remain open to Chris, so that\u2019s going to be interesting. I feel like Ace might be getting a little bit of a taste of his own medicine there, because he was really putting on the pressure when Chelley was with Austin. And now Chelley\u2019s with Ace, and Chris is putting on the pressure, so he feel knows what it feels like to be on the other side of that.",
      "Amaya and Zach. I think they\u2019re so cute. I love getting to see these little moments of them talk about cats or, you know, hula hooping in Casa. I just love the slice-of-life moments in the villa that we get to see because to me, that\u2019s when you really get to see what everyone\u2019s like around each other. So I hope we get to see more of that and more of them as well.",
      "Let\u2019s talk about the virality of it all. \u201cLove Island\u201d has been blowing up absolutely everywhere. Do you see these viral moments as they\u2019re happening, or are you just as surprised as we are?",
      "I mean, I watch all the episodes, of course, and then you never know what\u2019s going to gain traction online, what\u2019s going to be something that people really connect with. And so with the \u201cmommy-mamacita\u201d moment, I feel like watching the episode, I thought that was a hilarious moment, but then when it took on a life of its own online, it made it even more fun. And I feel like I\u2019m constantly reposting people doing that audio now, because it\u2019s just too funny.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion came on the show! Let\u2019s talk about that iconic and surprising collaboration, as well as whether any other influential figures might be fans of the show.",
      "It\u2019s funny, because I feel like every year, we find more and more influential figures that are big fans. Or, even right now, with Olivia Rodrigo and Ed Sheeran doing the \u201cLove Island\u201d audio \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure Ed Sheeran communicates via email, so he probably does not watch \u201cLove Island USA\u201d \u2014 but to have Olivia explaining to him what is \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d to me, is a moment that I wish I could be a fly on the wall for because I can only imagine how funny that is. And Megan Thee Stallion, is someone I\u2019ve been a huge fan of for a very long time. I\u2019ve gone to see her live performing so many times, and getting to meet her, she is an absolute delight of a person. She has the most beautiful energy, and I\u2019m in love with her.",
      "Viewers didn\u2019t get to see the deliberation process when Hannah and Jeremiah left the villa, which Iain told us earlier was the most shocking thing he\u2019d seen all season long. What might be a little bit of the process behind that deliberation? If you heard anything, would you be able to speak on that?",
      "I wasn\u2019t in the villa that day, so I wasn\u2019t watching, you know, the monitors of what they were talking about. But considering that, it was a big moment, and when they\u2019re editing that episode and putting it together, my major guesstimation is that they really wanted to keep in other conversations that they felt were really important to the storyline. So maybe more showing him or other people talking earlier in the episode about things, and then maybe after the fact, they wanted to really be able to show more of what it was like when everyone was saying goodbye and stuff like that. And if the deliberation was redundant or boring or fairly inconsequential or not really different to what they were talking about outside of the actual deliberation, there\u2019s really no point in showing it.",
      "I know you didn\u2019t want to say earlier who you\u2019re rooting for this season, but is there a couple that maybe you\u2019re not as excited to see on your screen?",
      "I guess ... they\u2019re not a couple as of this point that I know of right now, but I am never excited to see Taylor be wishy-washy about who he wants to be in a couple with, and I\u2019m definitely never excited to see Olandria second-guess her worth. Those are two things I\u2019m never excited to see. So I am kind of hoping that she finds the right person for her and not someone who\u2019s wishy-washy about whether or not they want to be with her.",
      "What is the most shocking thing that you\u2019ve seen this season?",
      "Oh, I think Charlie\u2019s dumping was very shocking. I really did not expect that at all.",
      "Do you ever expect the dumps going in? What\u2019s the preparation process behind that?",
      "Sometimes you never really know. I feel like going in, it\u2019s a little bit of you can guess, or you can say, like, OK, I feel like I\u2019ve seen these two people become a little bit closer, but whether or not they\u2019re actually going to pick this person or that person \u2014 there\u2019s really no way to know. And it\u2019s really down to the moment, and the islanders make their decisions. And sometimes I\u2019m like, OK, that makes sense, I get it. And other times I\u2019m just completely shocked \u2014 like Charlie, for example.",
      "What\u2019s next for you?",
      "Well, I will be going back to Los Angeles, and I have a long list of things that I need to get done, and I will be back in the sandwich shop in West Hollywood. Please come see us \u2014 Something About Her \u2014 and have a sandwich. I\u2019ll be there for some time."

      "The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.",
      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also signaled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing his successor.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after he fled Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "Anxiety is mounting over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, in which he is worshiped as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion. His succession plan is likely to have an impact on Tibetans opposed to China\u2019s tight control of the Himalayan autonomous region.",
      "The Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "The Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says that Tibet has prospered under its rule and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says that the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d that Beijing claims aim to protect the tradition and religious freedom.",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval by the central government, Mao, the ministry spokesperson, said Wednesday."

Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",
      "\"They've put a gun to my head, they\u2019ve threatened me, they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m done, that\u2019s it. But the most horrible thing I\u2019ve seen is how they killed my best friend,\u201d the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.",
      "\u201cI was required to do many things ... they send us to train to use a firearm, all of that comes together and from there come the hit men, from there come the thieves, the hawks,\u201d he said, referring to the murderers, thieves and drug traffickers.",
      "'They are recruiting more minors'",
      "Guanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, the addiction rate to this drug in the state grew 449% over the past 20 years.",
      "For David Miranda, a counselor at the Las Joyas de Le\u00f3n Addiction Assistance Center, a civil association, the rise in methamphetamine use is creating a social crisis in the state.",
      "\"They're recruiting more minors, ages 12 to 17,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cWithin these 'panic houses,' they recruit many minors who are now hit men.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited the Las Joyas neighborhood in the municipality of Le\u00f3n, where, according to the state\u2019s Security Secretariat, criminal groups have taken over a 380-unit housing complex.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Le\u00f3n right now is demanding and very serious,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cInside those houses there are women, girls, minors, and you see drug trafficking, trafficking of women, trafficking of everything.\"",
      "Most panic houses are in working-class neighborhoods like Las Joyas. According to the state government, there could be up to 60,000 homes across Guanajuato currently being used for illegal drug use.",
      "\u201cIn fact, you can see a panic house on any corner, anywhere. It\u2019s very easy to find them. There are many abandoned houses,\u201d one of the young men interviewed by Noticias Telemundo said.",
      "'I don\u2019t want to be caught again'",
      "According to state figures, at least 10 people have been murdered in panic houses in the last two years, and around 400 neighborhoods in the state are struggling with high crime rates.",
      "\u201cLe\u00f3n is the number one city in terms of drug dealing,\u201d said Juan Mauro Gonz\u00e1lez, Guanajuato\u2019s secretary of security.",
      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",
      "\"The most important thing to rehabilitate people is to change their mindset. They have to say they don\u2019t want that anymore, that they no longer want to suffer or be in that world where they were humiliated, abused, and forced to do things. They should want a different life; we do the rest and we help them,\u201d said Miranda, who said his addiction center has a capacity to serve 150 people.",
      "Meanwhile, young people like the ones interviewed by Noticias Telemundo continue to struggle to avoid falling back into addiction and the dangers of the \"haunted houses\" that abound on some areas of Guanajuato.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want them to catch me again and force me to do things,\u201d said one of the men, who told Noticias Telemundo he wants to move to another neighborhood and have an honest job as a pizza maker, as he enjoys feeding people.",
      "\u201cMy life is already very ruined, I was very humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make a change.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 As the dust settles on Iran after unprecedented Israeli and American attacks, the U.S. and Israel have shifted their focus toward an ambitious diplomatic push they hope will translate into the kind of enduring political stability that has evaded the region for decades.",
      "Despite apparent Iranian unwillingness, President Donald Trump is pushing for more talks with Tehran about its nuclear program. But Israel appears more interested in formalizing diplomatic relations with some of its long-standing adversaries, as well as ending the 18-month conflict in Gaza \u2014 which Trump has repeatedly pleaded for.",
      "\u201cThis victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe are working on this with enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "The previous Trump administration brokered what it called the Abraham Accords, in which Israel established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and later normalized its relations with Morocco in 2024 and Sudan, though that deal has yet to be ratified.",
      "Having devastated the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, its northern neighbor, and seen a Tehran-friendly regime toppled in Syria to the east, Israel is now interested in establishing formal diplomatic relations with both countries, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday",
      "The shift represents a broader change in Israeli policy toward its neighbors. Until around two weeks ago, Israel\u2019s modus operandi was to assert military dominance as a political strategy, according to Michael Oren, who served as the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2009 to 2013.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve seen in history when we have the opportunity to make the strategy the strategy. It\u2019s not a tactic,\u201d Oren, a former member of Israel\u2019s Knesset, or parliament, who served as deputy minister in the prime minister\u2019s office, told NBC News in a phone call on Friday.",
      "Before the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel relied on a method known in Hebrew as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d The term was used by strategists to describe the country\u2019s periodic attacks against Palestinian militants and their supply of weapons in Gaza, attacks that faced widespread criticism from rights groups often because of the disproportionate number of deaths caused by Israeli forces.",
      "The phrase could also apply to Israel's behavior toward Iran and its proxies in taking out military commanders, nuclear scientists and senior advisers to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while attacking nuclear and military sites. In Lebanon, it has wiped out large swaths of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership.",
      "Today, Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable challenge will be finding a resolution to end the conflict in Gaza, where, despite nearly 20 months of war, Hamas remains nominally in control.",
      "Under pressure from Trump, who on Truth Social on Sunday again called for a \u201cdeal in Gaza\u201d and to \u201cget the hostages back,\u201d the negotiations are also still captive to the same disagreements that have long delayed a deal.",
      "Hamas has refused to release its remaining hostages and surrender \u2014 key demands of far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, his national security minister, both of whom have threatened to quit and bring down the fragile coalition if he does otherwise. Along with other lawmakers they have also called for the complete destruction of Hamas.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has demanded a permanent truce, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and guarantees about humanitarian aid.",
      "The decline of power in Iran, Hamas' primary patron, will likely sap the group\u2019s confidence and influence, according to Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research center.",
      "\u201cFrom an Israeli standpoint, this is a dramatic shift in the acceptance for the Jewish state in the region,\u201d added Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament.",
      "But he cautioned that as long as Hamas is the governing body in Gaza, a deal to end the war there \u201cwill be something that is possible but it will be very difficult for the Israeli government to swallow.\u201d",
      "For now, Israel is in the ascendancy: Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been badly damaged, its 46-year-old Islamic regime is weakened and its proxy groups and allies throughout the region have been extensively damaged.",
      "Perhaps most important is that while the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran were publicly criticized, they were also quietly welcomed by its Arab neighbors, many of whom were quicker to condemn Iran\u2019s reprisal attack on the U.S. military base in Qatar than the American attack on Iran.",
      "For decades Iran has fostered allied regimes and proxy militia throughout the Middle East in order to fight Israel, its major ally in the region, the United States, and Shiite-majority Iran\u2019s adversaries among the Sunni-led Gulf kingdoms.",
      "Israel will now need those states to blaze a path toward an enduring peace, analysts said, or risk inflaming regional conflict even more.",
      "\u201cI think we see imperial Iran is in retreat,\u201d Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an associate professor of political science at the United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cIt probably means a more stable Middle East, a more stable region.\u201d",
      "Israel and the United States would do better to cultivate what Abdullah described as an \u201cAxis of Moderation\u201d of monied Gulf Arab kingdoms, many of whom have normalized relations with Israel \u2014 a play on the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d used to describe Iran and its regional proxy groups that Israel has largely defeated.",
      "Israel has nonetheless made clear its intention to continue attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear program should a perceived need arise. And in Gaza and Lebanon, it has continued to launch regular strikes against what it says are militant targets long after ceasefires were put in place.",
      "But Trump, whose angry outburst appeared to rein in an Israeli strike on Iran after he declared a ceasefire in the region, has shown he is capable of halting Israel\u2019s responses. Oren said this could help pave the way toward lasting stability by restraining Israel\u2019s more militant instincts.",
      "\u201cThe difference between tactics and strategy is in the hands of Donald Trump,\u201d Oren said. \u201cTo the greatest extent in Israel\u2019s history, our fate is in the hands of one person, and it\u2019s not the prime minister.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

      "In Switzerland, energy company Axpo shut down one of the reactor units at its Beznau nuclear power plant because of high water temperature in the River Aare. The plant, which typically takes cooling water from the river for use before returning it, is prevented from doing so by Swiss regulations when temperatures reach 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher to avoid causing damage to aquatic fauna and flora.",
      "\u201cDue to the high river water temperatures, Axpo has been increasingly reducing the output of the two reactor units at the Beznau nuclear power plant for days,\u201d the company said in a statement Wednesday, adding that one unit was currently operating at 50% capacity.",

      "In Turkey, wildfires burned for a second day and more than 50,000 people were evacuated by rescuers Wednesday, according to the AFAD emergency management authority.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday reportedly ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities.",
      "State media online reported the decision by President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "It follows a law passed by Iran\u2019s parliament to suspend that cooperation. It also already received the OK of a constitutional watchdog as well.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that would mean for the IAEA, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog.",
      "The Vienna-based IAEA long has monitored Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After the law\u2019s passage, Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council was to oversee the bill and implementation. While the council itself hasn\u2019t said anything publicly, Pezeshkian is the head of the council, so his reported order signals that the bill would be implemented.",
      "However, under Iran\u2019s theocractic government, there is room for the council to implement the bill as they see fit. That means that everything lawmakers asked for might not be done.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, negotiated under then U.S. President Barack Obama, allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% \u2014 enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight.",
      "But U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in 2018, unilaterally withdrew Washington from the accord, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough and didn\u2019t address Iran\u2019s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003."

      "LONDON \u2014 It was not her best goal or most important soccer match, but when the ball hit the back of the net in Natalie Washington's debut on a women's team in 2017, she felt a sense of belonging that had been missing.",
      "It was long in coming: Washington had struggled to fit in on a men's team and eventually stopped playing when she decided to transition to being a woman and go through gender-affirming surgery. When she joined a women's team, she quickly felt accepted.",
      "Now, after the United Kingdom's highest court in April said that for anti-discrimination purposes the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" refer to biological sex, Washington's opportunity to play the sport she loves in the league she wants is in doubt.",
      "The head of the U.K's Equality and Human Rights Commission followed the ruling a day later by saying the court had provided clarity and that transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "The Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in the U.K., followed up by banning transgender players from women's teams in England and Scotland, a ban that took effect at the start of June.",
      "\"It feels like things are being taken away from trans people on an almost daily basis,\" Washington said. \"It's another blow, another kick at a time when people are already hurting.\"",
      "Long a divisive issue",
      "Beyond Britain, inclusion of trans players in sports has long been a divisive issue, with arguments primarily focused on whether it's fair to have athletes born as boys compete against girls and women. In the U.S., it has been particularly politicized, with most Republican-controlled states banning transgender athletes in girls' sports and President Donald Trump signing an executive order to prohibit participation of transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "The U.K. court said trans people were still protected from discrimination under British law, such as in employment, housing and education, but the ruling means access to certain single-sex facilities could be curtailed.",
      "Trans rights groups condemned the decision, which is likely to have a profound effect for thousands. Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count.",
      "The feminist groups who led the legal challenge cheered the ruling and others, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, welcomed the clarity it brought.",
      "\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" said Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, which brought the case.",
      "A difficult decision",
      "Washington, who leads the group Football v Transphobia, was one of 28 transgender women registered with the Football Association to play amateur soccer. In order to play the women's game, they had to have testosterone levels reduced to the range of biologically born females.",
      "After the ruling, the organization changed its rules, saying that although it had aimed to make soccer accessible to as many people as possible, it was always prepared to alter its policy if there were changes in the law or science.",
      "\"We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,\" the FA said, adding that it would contact transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can remain involved.",
      "Some clubs have responded by finding ways around the ban. Goal Diggers FC, a women and nonbinary inclusive soccer club based in London, has withdrawn from all FA-affiliated leagues.",
      "On June 1, the day the ban took effect, Goal Diggers hosted an inclusive women's tournament in London, drawing more than 100 players in a show of solidarity.",
      "\"I'll always have a place here and I'll always be a trans woman,\" said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old trans player for Goal Diggers. \"No one can take that away from me.\"",
      "Other voices, other sports",
      "Groups that have campaigned to keep trans athletes from girls' and women's teams, citing a matter of safety and fairness, welcomed the move by the FA.",
      "\"The FA had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in women's teams,\" said Fiona McAnena of Sex Matters.",
      "Groups that oversee cricket and netball, an offshoot of basketball that is played mainly by women, also limited women's competition to those who were assigned at birth as females.",
      "The England and Wales Cricket Board said transgender women and girls could continue playing in open and mixed cricket. England Netball said it would allow anyone to play in a new mixed category beginning in September.",
      "How the ruling came about",
      "The legal case involved a 2018 Scottish law requiring at least half of the seats on public boards to be held by women. Trans women with certificates recognizing their gender were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "The court said that using the certificates to identify someone's gender clashes with the definitions of man and woman. Under the ruling, a transgender person could not claim they had been discriminated against if barred from a single-sex space.",
      "Alexander Maine, a senior lecturer at The City Law School specializing in gender, sexuality and law, said the ruling clouds the value of a document sanctioned by the U.K. Gender Recognition Act that allows them to later update their birth certificate reflecting their acquired gender.",
      "\"There may be a challenge at the European Court of Human Rights brought by trans individuals who say that there is a problem where they may be two sexes at once,\" Maine said.",
      "Someone could hold \"a gender recognition certificate stating that they are their acquired gender, whereas under the U.K. Equality Act, they are still recognized in their birth gender,\" he said.",
      "Washington and many others say they worry the ruling may lead to more hatred aimed at trans people.",
      "\"For the first time in a long time, I felt scared about how people are going to react to me in public,\" Washington said. \"I don't feel anymore that I can guarantee I have support to turn to from authorities.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/thailand-prime-minister-suspended-leaked-phone-call-cambodia-official-rcna216151",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:26:09 GMT",
    "summary": "A Thai court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office Tuesday pending investigation over a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian leader.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday, pending an ethics investigation over accusations that she was too deferential to a senior Cambodian leader when the two discussed a recent border dispute in a phone call that was leaked.",
      "Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the dispute, which involved an armed confrontation on May 28, in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. In a call with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, she attempted to defuse tensions \u2014 but instead set off a string of complaints and public protests by critics who accused her of being too fawning.",
      "Familiar pattern",
      "Paetongtarn's suspension raises the possibility of renewed instability in Thailand, a still fragile democracy that has suffered several similar bouts of uncertainty. At the root of much of that were concerns from the conservative establishment, including the military, that the political dynasty started by Paetongtarn's father, the popular but divisive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was growing too powerful.",
      "She is the third member of her family to hold the prime minister's office \u2014 and the third to face the possibility of removal before her term ended. Thaksin was removed from office in a 2006 coup and driven into exile, while his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawtra, was removed by a court order in 2014, followed shortly after by a coup.",
      "This \"recurring cycle of political instability\" would likely keep repeating unless Thailand goes through a genuine democratic reform that includes limiting power of unelected institutions, said Purawich Watanasukh, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University in Bangkok.",
      "\"Without such foundational reforms, any government, regardless of who leads it, will remain vulnerable to the same forces that have repeatedly disrupted Thailand's democratic development,\" he said.",
      "Growing discontent",
      "The suspension also comes at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown and growing discontent with Paetongtarn and her Pheu Thai party, in general, with critics saying her government's performance has been underwhelming.",
      "The judges voted unanimously Tuesday to review the petition accusing her of a breach of the ethics, and voted 7-2 to immediately suspend her from duty as a prime minister until a ruling is given. The court gave Paetongtarn 15 days to give evidence to support her case.",
      "After the court order, Paetongtarn said that she would accept the process and defended her actions.",
      "\"I only thought about what to do to avoid troubles, what to do to avoid armed confrontation, for the soldiers not to suffer any loss,\" she said.",
      "She also apologized to people upset over the leaked call and left the Government House shortly after.",
      "Suriya Jungrungruangkit, who is a deputy prime minister and a transport minister, will take charge as acting prime minister, said Chousak Sirinil, minister of the prime minister's office.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, before the court suspended Paetongtarn, King Maha Vajiralongkorn had endorsed a Cabinet reshuffle after a major party left the government coalition over the leaked call.",
      "In the reshuffle, Paetongtarn also received the position of culture minister, in addition to prime minister, though it's not clear if she can take the oath to take up that role.",
      "In the call about the border tensions, Paetongtarn could be heard urging Hun Sen \u2014 a longtime friend of her father \u2014 not to listen to a Thai regional army commander who had publicly criticized Cambodia about the border dispute, and called him \"an opponent.\"",
      "Thousands of conservative, nationalist-leaning protesters rallied in central Bangkok on Saturday to demand Paetongtarn's resignation.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces separate investigations by another agency over the leaked call \u2014 a case that could also lead to her removal.",
      "The Constitutional Court last year removed Paetongtarn's predecessor over a breach of ethics. Thailand's courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are viewed as a defender of the royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",
      "Fallout from leaked call",
      "Paetongtarn, 38, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin. Her father has remained beloved by many of the Thailand's poor and working classes who long saw him as their champion.",
      "But the family's political fortunes now may be on the wane.",
      "Thaksin alienated many of his supporters with what looked like a self-serving deal with his former conservative opponents. It allowed his return from exile in 2023 and the party he supported to form the new government, while sidelining the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in a national election, but was seen by the conservative establishment as a greater threat.",
      "Thaksin has faced several legal challenges since his return. On Tuesday, he attended a court hearing in a case alleging he defamed the monarchy in 2015.",
      "He also is under investigation over the handling of his return to face an eight-year prison term on charges related to corruption and abuse of power. At the time, he was transferred almost immediately to a hospital, and later granted clemency because of his age and health without spending a single night in jail.",
      "The complaints argue he avoided properly serving his sentence and raise the possibility that Thaksin could be forced to serve prison time."
