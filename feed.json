      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut is making a return appearance at this year\u2019s Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest",
      "The champ is coming back to chomp.",
      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",
      "Asked his favorite, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve all been good, for different reasons. The first one was great, the last one was great.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- The Paris Games may be over, but the flame is still rising \u2014 just don\u2019t call it Olympic.",
      "The helium-powered hot-air balloon that lit up the French capital's skyline during the 2024 Games is making a dramatic comeback to the Tuileries Gardens, reborn as the \u201cParis Cauldron.\u201d",
      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is taking his seat in the president's box for opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at the Kennedy Center",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",

      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",

      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers on Monday, after a judge stepped in for a jury on grounds the evidence presented by the defendants was incontrovertible.",
      "Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh issued his directed verdict against former doctor William Husel, whose attorneys accused Michigan-based Trinity Health and Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus of orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation.",
      "Husel was seeking more than $18 million from the health care companies.",
      "His attorney, David Vermillion, said in a statement that Husel's legal team was disappointed that McIntosh would prevent the jury from making a decision in the case after weeks of evidence and testimony had been presented. He said issuing the directed verdict, a procedural move requested by the hospital, \u201ceffectively silences the voices of those who came seeking justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the outcome that any reasonable person expected, nor is it one that reflects the strength of the evidence presented,\" he said. \u201cWe are evaluating all legal options, including appeal. This case has always been about more than one courtroom or one ruling. It is about truth, accountability, and the right of every individual to defend their name against false and damaging accusations.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel issued a statement that said simply, \u201cWe are pleased with the judge\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel Health System fired the doctor in 2018 after it concluded he had ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years.",
      "He initially was charged with murder in 25 deaths in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. Eleven counts were dismissed before trial.",
      "Husel, now 49, maintained he was trying to help patients deal with their pain, sometimes in the last moments of their life, not speed up their deaths. Despite being found not guilty by a jury on murder charges in 2022, he permanently surrendered his medical license.",
      "He filed multiple lawsuits against his former employer, accusing Trinity Health and Mount Carmel of defamation and malicious prosecution.",
      "As part of the defamation lawsuit filed in 2019, Husel\u2019s attorneys said Trinity Health repeatedly spread lies and false information to convince the public and law enforcement that Husel was a killer, even though health system officials knew that was not true.",
      "\u201cObviously, these false allegations destroyed Dr. Husel\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit said. Husel gave up his medical license because his lawyers said that he knew the damage to his reputation would prevent him from working as a doctor.",
      "In court documents filed two years ago, Husel said he had been unable to find work and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.",
      "Trinity Health had asked a judge to toss the lawsuit, but a Franklin County judge ruled there was enough reason to move forward.",
      "Husel, who worked in the intensive care unit, was charged in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for nonsurgical situations indicated an intent to end lives.",
      "His colleagues who administered the medications at Mount Carmel West Hospital in Columbus weren\u2019t criminally charged, but the hospital said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation and referred various employees to their respective state boards for disciplinary action.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",
      "The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",

Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",
      "About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.",
      "Republicans are especially likely to say \u201ctoo much\u201d is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents \u2014 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents.",
      "When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think \u201ctoo little\u201d money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo.",
      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",
      "When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security.",
      "About 3 in 10 say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending \u201ctoo little.\u201d Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d",
      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",
      "The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives.",
      "Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is \u201ctoo much\u201d federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023.",

      "Breaking down barriers surrounding mental health was a personal mission for Jim Irsay, the beloved owner of the Indianapolis Colts who passed away last month",
      "Breaking down barriers surrounding mental health was a personal mission for Jim Irsay, the beloved owner of the Indianapolis Colts who died last month at age 65.",
      "It\u2019s personal for Kalen Jackson, too.",
      "Irsay\u2019s youngest daughter, who joins sisters Carlie Irsay-Gordon and Casey Foyt in running the team, has talked openly about dealing with anxiety. Irsay-Gordon is the CEO with Foyt as executive vice president and Jackson chief brand officer.",
      "Jackson leads \u201cKicking The Stigma,\u201d the family\u2019s initiative to raise awareness about mental health disorders. The organization is committed to dismantling the stigma often associated with these illnesses and has been focused on expanding access to critical services across Indiana and nationwide.",
      "The Colts have donated more than $30 million to nonprofits and organizations in the mental health space since the initiative launched in 2020.",
      "\u201cThe stigma piece to me has almost become synonymous in my head with the way we handle it as a culture because the stigma comes from prejudice and judgment and that comes from how it\u2019s presented in our culture over time,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHow do we change that conversation? With that will come so much of the change that we\u2019re fighting so hard to get to in terms of having more things covered (by) insurance or the way the hospital networks look at this, the way that companies look at this and supporting their employees.\u201d",
      "Irsay often spoke publicly about his battles with alcoholism and addiction, hoping his journey to sobriety would inspire and encourage others.",
      "Jackson\u2019s voice will continue to carry on the conversation.",
      "\u201cI am so proud of the legacy he has left behind and I only hope to make him proud,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "Jackson will be recognized by Project Healthy Minds, a Millennial and Gen Z-driven mental health tech nonprofit, for becoming a trailblazing leader in mental health advocacy. She will receive the organization\u2019s first \u201cSports Visionary of the Year\u201d Award at the third annual World Mental Health Day Gala on Oct. 9 in New York. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will present Jackson with the award at an event that\u2019s brought together celebrities, executives, and cultural leaders, including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.",
      "\u201cWhen we all got together to decide who should win this inaugural award, it was unanimous that it should be Kalen and the Colts because they have been so committed to mental health in sports,\u201d said Phillip Schermer, founder and CEO of Project Healthy Minds. \u201cIt\u2019s not talking the talk, it\u2019s walking the walk. They\u2019ve been doing this from the beginning and I think they\u2019ve sort of lit a path for what I think every sport and every league ought to do.\u201d",
      "For Jackson, who is on the nonprofit's Board of Directors, the mission is clear.",
      "\u201cTo connect with people and to be compassionate and to try to change the world for the better, that\u2019s kind of what all this is for me,\u201d she said.",
      "The NFL and NFL Players Association in 2019 agreed to make it a requirement to have a licensed behavioral health clinician on the staff of each team in an effort to increase mental health resources.",
      "The Colts have taken it further. They recently hired a clinician to also work with front-office staff and coaches.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have to wait to know what impact it\u2019s going to have,\u201d Jackson said.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",
      "Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.",
      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",
      "Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.",

      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "The girl's family says that her Minnesota school district didn\u2019t do enough to make sure she has the accommodations she needs to learn, including failing to provide adequate instruction in the evening when her seizures are less frequent.",
      "But lower courts ruled against the family's discrimination claims in court, despite finding the school had fallen short. That\u2019s because courts in that part of the country require plaintiffs in lawsuits against schools to show officials used \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d a higher legal standard than most disability discrimination claims.",

      "Every month, thousands of women evade abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to send them pregnancy-ending drugs through the mail",
      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",
      "But it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",
      "Pills can arrive in a less than a week.",
      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",
      "A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- The death toll from an attack by gunmen over the weekend in north-central Nigeria has climbed to 150, survivors said Monday as the villagers were still digging through burned homes, counting their dead and looking for dozens of people still missing.",
      "Assailants stormed Benue state\u2019s Yelewata community late on Friday night, opening fire on villagers who were asleep and setting their homes ablaze, survivors and the local farmers union said. Many of those killed were sheltering in a local market after fleeing violence in other parts of the state.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killings, but such attacks are common in Nigeria\u2019s northern region where local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water. The prolonged conflict has become deadlier in recent years, with authorities and analysts warning that more herdsmen are taking up arms.",
      "The farmers accuse the herders, mostly of Fulani origin, of grazing their livestock on their farms and destroying their produce. The herders insist that the lands are grazing routes that were first backed by law in 1965, five years after the country gained its independence.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, whose government has fallen short of expectations in ending the country\u2019s deadly security crises, described the Benue attack as \u201csenseless bloodletting\u201d while his office said he would visit the stricken community on Wednesday.",
      "Titus Tsegba, who lost his wife and four of his children in the attack, said more than 20 bodies were recovered on Monday. The initial death toll was reported to be 100 on Saturday.",
      "His wife and children \u2014 the youngest 8 and the oldest 27 \u2014 were \u201cburned into ashes beyond recognition,\u201d he told The Associated Press, adding that he survived because he was sleeping in another part of the community.",
      "\"Everything is gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Benue Deputy Gov. Sam Ode said he suspected the perpetrators were herdsmen. Ode and the survivors spoke to the AP by phone.",
      "The gunmen made it difficult for many to flee after surrounding the Yelewata community, which is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) away from the state capital of Makurdi, said Jacob Psokaa, who lost his 55-year-old father in the attack.",
      "\u201cThey were coming from different sides at the same moment \u2026 it was sporadic shooting,\u201d Psokaa said. \u201cThe situation is very bad now with many people in the ground \u2026 your people leaving you suddenly.\u201d",
      "The gunmen also burned food stores in the local market, razing a year\u2019s harvest that included rice and yam, staple food mainly exported from Benue to other parts of Nigeria.",
      "\u201cEnough is enough!\u201d said Tinubu, the president. \u201cI have directed the security agencies to act decisively, arrest perpetrators of these evil acts on all sides of the conflict, and prosecute them.\u201d",

      "Instead, Steven Crowchild prayed, consulted with his peoples' leaders and ultimately opted to stay on the tarmac for a long conversation with Trump that he hopes will call more attention to promoting peace, protecting clean water and other issues key to Canada's First Nation peoples.",
      "\u201cIt was really intense, to say the least,\" Crowchild told The Associated Press on Monday, recalling his lengthy encounter with Trump on Sunday night in Calgary for the G7 in nearby Kananaskis. \u201cWhen I woke up on Father's Day, I didn\u2019t anticipate I would be seeing world leaders, and one certain individual that has caused much pain and suffering in the world.\u201d",
      "In Canada, First Nations refers to one of three major legally recognized groups of aboriginal people. Crowchild, of the Tsuut\u2019ina First Nation, is a Tsuut\u2019ina Isgiya and a current elected member of the Tsuut\u2019ina Nation Xakujaa-yina and Chief and Council.",
      "Crowchild said he spoke in his people's traditional language, wore feathered headgear that made him feel strong and showed Trump treaty medals that he told the president were older than Canada itself. Trump wore a white \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap and appeared to be listening at length \u2014 though both sides declined to comment on exactly what was said.",
      "\u201cWhen it came to that one individual, I almost didn\u2019t stay. I was filled with rage,\u201d Crowchild said. \u201cI was going to go home because I didn\u2019t want to bring any negativity to my people. However, I did consult with close people and advisers and, based on feedback, I stayed, considering that visibility is key and diplomacy is important.\"",
      "Aware that \u201cno Indigenous representation was there at the time,\u201d Crowchild said he \u201cprayed to my creator\u201d and \u201creally thought of those suffering around the world\u201d in choosing to speak to Trump.",
      "\"Instead of war, I choose peace,\" he said.",
      "Crowchild said that, in addition to Trump, he greeted other arriving world leaders and \"tried to remind each one of them to try to be a good leader and protect our water for future generations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI spoke for my elders,\" Crowchild said, noting that he spoke of promoting peace and \u201cprotecting water for future generations\" and tried to \u201csay as much as I could, as wisely as I could, while representing with honor and dignity. Whether he listened or not, time will tell.\u201d",
      "He said that, ultimately, the U.S. president is \u201cjust another person.\"",
      "\u201cSome would say he\u2019s a horrible person, and we all know many reasons,\" Crowchild said. \"I stood taller than him as proud Tsuut\u2019ina Isgiya.\u201d",

      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats known as \u201cVoyagers\u201d have been put into service by the Danish Armed Forces for a three-month operational trial",
      "KOGE MARINA, Denmark -- From a distance they look almost like ordinary sailboats, their sails emblazoned with the red-and-white flag of Denmark.",
      "But these 10-meter-long (30-foot-long) vessels carry no crew and are designed for surveillance.",
      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats, known as \u201cVoyagers,\u201d have been put into service by Denmark's armed forces for a three-month operational trial.",
      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",
      "Their launch comes after two others already joined a NATO patrol on June 6.",
      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",
      "The Danish Defense Ministry says the trial is aimed at boosting surveillance capacity in under-monitored waters, especially around critical undersea infrastructure such as fiber-optic cables and power lines.",
      "\u201cThe security situation in the Baltic is tense,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Kim J\u00f8rgensen, the director of Danish National Armaments at the ministry. \u201cThey\u2019re going to cruise Danish waters, and then later they\u2019re going to join up with the two that are on (the) NATO exercise. And then they\u2019ll move from area to area within the Danish waters.\"",
      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",
      "The trial also unfolds against a backdrop of trans-Atlantic friction \u2014 with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatening to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a NATO ally. Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military force to take Greenland.",
      "Jenkins, the founder of Saildrone, noted that his company had already planned to open its operation in Denmark before Trump was reelected. He didn't want to comment on the Greenland matter, insisting the company isn't political.",
      "Some of the maritime disruptions have been blamed on Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet \u2014 aging oil tankers operating under opaque ownership to avoid sanctions. One such vessel, the Eagle S, was seized by Finnish police in December for allegedly damaging a power cable between Finland and Estonia with its anchor.",
      "Amid these concerns, NATO is moving to build a layered maritime surveillance system combining uncrewed surface vehicles like the Voyagers with traditional naval ships, satellites and seabed sensors.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is that you basically need to be on the water all the time, and it\u2019s humongously expensive,\" said Peter Viggo Jakobsen of the Royal Danish Defence College. \u201cIt\u2019s simply too expensive for us to have a warship trailing every single Russian ship, be it a warship or a civilian freighter of some kind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together a layered system that will enable us to keep constant monitoring of potential threats, but at a much cheaper level than before,\u201d he added.",

      "VIENNA -- The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday that there is a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination within Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz following Israeli strikes, although radiation levels outside the complex are presently normal.",
      "IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the radiation poses a significant danger if uranium is inhaled or ingested. He added that the risk can be effectively managed with appropriate protective measures, such as using respiratory protection devices while inside the facilities.",
      "\u201cThe level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event,\u201d Grossi said.",
      "Grossi was addressing an urgent session of the U.N. nuclear watchdog board in Vienna that was convened at the request of Russia to discuss Israeli attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities. He said there apparently was no additional damage at Natanz and the Isfahan nuclear research site since Saturday.",
      "He said that the main concern inside the Natanz facility is the chemical toxicity of a gas called uranium hexafluoride, which is the result of fluorine mixed with the uranium during enrichment. It is extremely volatile, will quickly corrode, can burn the skin and is especially deadly if inhaled, experts say.",
      "\u201cAmid theses challenging and complex circumstances, it is crucial that the IAEA receives timely and regular technical information about the facilities and their respective sites,\u201d Grossi said.",
      "Without information, the U.N. nuclear watchdog \u201ccannot accurately assess the radiological conditions and potential impacts on the population and the environment and cannot provide the necessary assistance.\u201d",
      "Grossi said that U.N. inspectors will remain present in Iran and inspect the nuclear facilities \u201cas soon as safety conditions allow.\u201d",
      "He warned that \u201cmilitary escalation threatens lives, increases the chance of a radiological release with serious consequences for people and the environment and delays indispensable work towards a diplomatic solution for the long-term assurance that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show extensive damage at Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. The images captured Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility.",
      "Grossi told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to be hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The IAEA said four critical buildings were damaged, including an uranium-conversion facility, but there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "Grossi on Monday also told the IAEA board of governors that no damage has been seen at the site of the Fordo enrichment site, which is buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries. Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Grossi also said that the Bushehr nuclear power plant, Iran\u2019s only commercial nuclear power plant, has not been targeted nor affected by the recent attacks and neither has the Tehran Research Reactor.",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, remained shuttered most of Monday when staff went on strike in frustration over what they called unmanageable crowds at an institution crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the \u20ac700\u2013800 million million renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards.

      "BERLIN -- A German court sentenced a Syrian doctor to life imprisonment for torture and war crimes in his Syrian homeland on Monday for killing two people and torturing nine in Syria between 2011 and 2012.",
      "The Frankfurt Higher Regional Court also established the particular gravity of the guilt, which in practice virtually rules out early release after 15 years \u2014 as is often the case in Germany when people are sentenced to life imprisonment. The 40-year-old Syrian, who was identified as Alaa M. in line with German privacy rules, was placed in preventive detention, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "In his verdict, presiding judge Christoph Koller described the actions of the accused in the military hospital in the Syrian city of Homs in the early stages of the civil war that began in 2011. He said the doctor had sadistic tendencies and acted them out during the torture.",
      "\u201cAbove all, the accused enjoyed harming people that seemed inferior and low-value to him,\u201d Koller said, according to dpa.",
      "During the trial, which lasted almost three and a half years, victims had described the most severe abuse, including beatings, kicks and the setting of wounds and body parts on fire, dpa reported.",
      "Koller emphasized that without the willingness and courage of witnesses to share the details of their suffering the facts of the case could not have been clarified.",
      "M. had lived in Germany for ten years and had worked as an orthopedic surgeon in several clinics, most recently in Bad Wildungen in northern Hesse. In summer 2020, he was arrested after some of his victims had recognized him from a TV documentary about Homs, dpa reported.",
      "The doctor supposedly tortured prisoners who were considered part of the opposition to former Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. The trial against him began in January 2022.",
      "Alaa M. described himself as not guilty during the trial, alleging that he was the victim of a conspiracy, dpa wrote. The verdict is not yet final.",

      "Cambodian and Thai authorities have engaged in saber-rattling since last week, and continue to implement or threaten measures short of armed force, keeping tensions high. Thailand has added restrictions at border crossings, and Cambodia has banned Thai movies and TV shows and implemented a boycott of the neighboring country\u2019s international internet links.",
      "Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the former prime minister, said in a televised speech Monday that the ban on Thai fruits and vegetables would take effect if Thailand doesn\u2019t lift the border restrictions by Tuesday.",
      "Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra later said Thailand decided to impose the border restrictions out of safety concerns for the citizens of both countries due to the heavier presence of armed forces along the areas. She also said any \u201cunprofessional communication\u201d that was conveyed outside a bilateral mechanism would only hurt the interests of both sides.",
      "Officials of the two countries met over the weekend in Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, on the conflicting territorial claims that led to last month\u2019s deadly confrontation. While both sides said the meeting was held in a good atmosphere, it appears no major breakthrough was achieved to resolve the current spat.",
      "Cambodia on Sunday said it has officially submitted a request to the U.N.\u2019s International Court of Justice, seeking a resolution to the ongoing border disputes with Thailand in four areas. The Cambodia\u2019s State Secretariat of Border Affairs said after the weekend meetings concluded that Cambodia would no longer discuss these areas under the bilateral mechanism of the two countries.",

In Thailand, the elected government of Prime Minister Paetongtarn has been attacked by right-wing nationalists who are longtime foes of her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
      "There is a long history to the territorial disputes between the two countries. Thailand is still rankled by a 1962 ICJ ruling that awarded Cambodia the disputed territory where the historic Preah Vihear temple stands. There were sporadic though serious clashes there in 2011.

      "Nearly 3,000 white crosses on a hill in South Africa are a memorial to white people killed on farms over the last three decades",
      "MOKOPANE, South Africa -- The white crosses are staked in the ground on an otherwise barren hillside on the edge of a farm, each one standing as a reminder of a terrible story of a person being killed.",
      "But the crosses, nearly 3,000 of them, do not tell the full story of South Africa's farm killings.",
      "The Witkruis Monument \u2014 which means White Cross Monument in the language spoken by South Africa's white Afrikaner minority \u2014 is a memorial only to white people who were killed on farms over the last three decades. It's a visceral snapshot seized on by some South Africans to drive a discredited narrative that white farmers in the majority Black country are being targeted in a widespread, race-based system of persecution.",
      "The false narrative has also been spread by conservative commentators in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 and amplified by South African-born Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump escalated the rhetoric, using the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe violence against white farmers.",
      "The South African government and experts who have studied farm killings have publicly denounced the misinformation spread by Trump and others. Even the caretaker of Witkruis says the monument \u2014 which makes no reference to the hundreds of Black South African farmers and farmworkers who have been killed \u2014 does not tell the complete story.",
      "The killings of farmers and farmworkers, regardless of race, are a tiny percentage of the country's high level of crime, and they typically occur during armed robberies, according to available statistics and two studies carried out over the last 25 years.",
      "Yet because wealthier white people own 72% of South Africa's privately owned farms, according to census data, they are disproportionately affected by these often brutal crimes. Black people own just 4% of the country\u2019s privately owned farmland, and the rest is owned by people who are mixed race or of Indian heritage.",
      "Misinformation about farm killings has been fueled by right-wing political groups in South Africa and others outside the country, said Gareth Newman, a crime expert at the Institute for Security Studies think tank in Pretoria.",
      "Some of the fringe South African groups, which hold no official power, boycotted the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, when South Africa's apartheid system of white minority rule officially ended. They have espoused a debunked theory of persecution \u2014 in a country where whites make up about 7% of the population \u2014 ever since.",
      "\u201cThey held on to these beliefs as a way of maintaining social cohesion in their groups, making sure that they can obtain funding and support,\" Newman said. \"And they were getting support from right-wing groups abroad because it fit their narrative.\"",
      "The Witkruis Monument was started in 2004 but recognizes victims going back to 1994.",
      "Each year, more crosses are planted to memorialize white farmers and their family members who were killed, organizers say. Recently, they've planted around 50 crosses a year.",
      "Kobus de Lange, a local Afrikaner farmer, has taken on the role of caretaker of Witkruis. He gave The Associated Press access to see the memorial, bringing along his wife and children to help tidy up the monument in the country's north, near the town of Mokopane.",
      "De Lange expressed the fear and frustration of a white farming community that feels authorities have not done enough to protect them. One of his sons wore a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cenough is enough\u201d \u2014 written in their Afrikaans language \u2014 in reference to the killings.",
      "But de Lange acknowledged that the memorial does not capture the full scope of farm killings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s across the board, there are Black farmers who are also attacked,\u201d de Lange said. He said in some farm attacks, Black farmworkers are tortured by criminals for information on how to break into the main farmhouse.",
      "The Witkruis Monument would be willing to put up crosses to Black farmers and farmworkers who have been killed, but their relatives haven't requested it, he said.",
      "The monument includes memorabilia bearing the flags of conservative Afrikaner movements, symbols that are generally frowned upon because Afrikaners were at the heart of the apartheid government.",
      "From April 2023 through March 2024, there were 49 farm killings recorded by AfriForum, a white Afrikaner lobby group. That's about 0.2% of overall murders tallied by the government over the same period. The group recorded 296 farm robberies in that timeframe, or about 0.7% of all robberies.",
      "AfriForum's numbers don't include killings of Black farmers and workers, and the country\u2019s official crime statistics are not broken down by race.",
      "Black people make up more than 80% of South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million, and most victims of violent crime across South Africa are Black. But there is no public relations campaign to raise awareness about the killing of Black farmers.",
      "Across racial lines, most public outcry about crime in South Africa is over the high rates of rape and murder of women and children, which mostly takes place in cities and townships.",
      "To tamp down misinformation, South African police last month took the unprecedented step of providing a racial breakdown of farm killings during the first three months of the year. Between January and March, there were six murders on farms, down from 12 during the same period last year. One of the victims was white, the rest were Black.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump is saying about whites being targeted does not exist,\" said MmaNtuli Buthelezi, who lives on a farm in Normandien, a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal province.",
      "Black farmworkers also feel vulnerable, Buthelezi said. \"We don\u2019t even have small firearms. Our weapons are just a spear and a shield, and sticks we get from the woods.\u201d",
      "Nomandien is an area where the farming community planted white crosses to raise awareness about farm killings in 2020. During a White House visit last month by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump showed a video in which he incorrectly referred to the location as a \u201cburial site\u201d of slain white farmers.",
      "Also, and without evidence, Trump has accused South Africa's Black-led government of \u201cfueling\u201d what he said was racially motivated violence against whites. In February, Trump issued an executive order punishing the country by banning all U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa.",
      "The Trump administration has cited a chant used by a minority Black-led political party in South Africa that has the lyrics \u201cshoot the farmer\u201d as contributing to what it claims is the racially motivated killings of white farmers. Violent crimes against farmers were a problem for years before the apartheid-era chant was revived.",
      "The South African government investigated farm killings in 2003. It interviewed dozens of police detectives and other experts and concluded that robbery was the most common motive for violent crimes, including murders, that occurred on farms. A study by the South African Human Rights Commission in 2015 reached a similar conclusion.",
      "\u201cIt is criminal individuals and groups that are targeting them because they are considered vulnerable,\u201d said Newham, who has researched the subject for more than 15 years. \u201cThey have things like cars, guns and laptops.\u201d",
      "In some cases, perpetrators are former laborers who return to attack, kill and rob farm owners to settle disputes over money. In others, disgruntled former employees had returned simply for revenge, according to historical records of the National Prosecuting Authority.",

      "\u201cI have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\u201d Trump posted on the site then known as Twitter.",
      "This time, Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China's continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains.",
      "Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to have to pay.' But I think we'll have a few, few new trade deals.\"",
      "At stake might be the survival of the G7 itself at a time when the Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether the president will attend the November Group of 20 summit in South Africa.",
      "What Trump opposed at the 2018 summit in Quebec wasn't just tariffs, but a focus on having alliances with a shared set of standards seeking to shape policies.",
      "\u201cThe big dispute in Quebec were the references to the rules-based international order and that\u2019s where that famous photo comes from,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s counselor at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and a veteran of six G7 summits. \u201cI think it gave everyone the idea that G7s were maybe not business as usual.\u201d",
      "The German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments have each signaled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can reduce the likelihood of outbursts.",
      "\u201cWell, I have got a good relationship with President Trump, and that\u2019s important,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday as he flew to Canada.",
      "There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump's team for the G7 in Trump's first term.",
      "The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers' meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems.",
      "The G7 even briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation.",
      "Trump will have at least three scheduled bilateral meetings during the summit with other world leaders while in Canada, staring on Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. president is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to an administration official.",
      "The U.S. president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos, all of which have disproportionately hit Japan. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.",
      "The United Kingdom reached a trade framework with the U.S. that included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump's first term.",
      "The Trump administration has insisted that its broad tariffs will produce trade agreements that box out China, though it's unclear how antagonizing trade partners would make them want to strengthen their reliance on the U.S. Carney, the Canadian leader, has been outspoken in saying his country can no longer look to the U.S. as an enduring friend.",
      "That might leave Trump with the awkward task of wanting to keep his tariffs in place while also trying to convince other countries that they're better off siding with the U.S. than China.",
      "\u201cTrump will try to coordinate the group against China\u2019s economic coercion,\u201d Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis. \u201cBut the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren\u2019t imposing tariffs on his allies.\u201d",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, triggering air raid sirens across the country as emergency services reported at least five killed and dozens more wounded in the fourth day of open warfare between the regional foes that showed no sign of slowing.",
      "One missile fell near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, and its concussion caused minor damage, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said on X. There were no injuries to American personnel.",
      "Iran announced it had launched some 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for Israel's sweeping attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure, which have killed at least 224 people in the country since last Friday.",
      "The attacks raised Israel\u2019s total death toll to at least 18, and in response the Israeli military said fighter jets had struck 10 command centers in Tehran belonging to Iran's Quds Force, an elite arm of its Revolutionary Guard that conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran.",
      "Powerful explosions, likely from Israel\u2019s defense systems intercepting Iranian missiles, rocked Tel Aviv shortly before dawn on Monday, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky over the coastal city.",
      "Authorities in the central Israeli city of Petah Tikva said that Iranian missiles had hit a residential building there, charring concrete walls, shattering windows and ripping the walls off multiple apartments.",
      "The Israeli Magen David Adom emergency service reported that two women and two men \u2014 all in their 70s \u2014 and one other person were killed in the wave of missile attacks that struck four sites in central Israel.",
      "\u201cWe clearly see that our civilians are being targeted,\u201d said Israeli police spokesman Dean Elsdunne outside the bombed-out building in Petah Tikva. \u201cAnd this is just one scene. We have other sites like this near the coast, in the south.\u201d",
      "Petah Tikva resident Yoram Suki rushed with his family to a shelter after hearing an air raid alert, and emerged after it was over to find his apartment destroyed.",
      "\u201cThank God we were OK,\u201d the 60-year-old said.",
      "Despite losing his home, he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to keep up the attacks on Iran.",
      "\u201cIt's totally worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is for the sake of our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "In addition to those killed, the MDA said paramedics had evacuated another 87 wounded people to hospitals, including a 30-year-old woman in serious condition, while rescuers were still searching for residents trapped beneath the rubble of their homes.",
      "\u201cWhen we arrived at the scene of the rocket strike, we saw massive destruction,\u201d said Dr. Gal Rosen, a paramedic with MDA who said he had rescued a 4-day-old baby as fires blazed from the building.",
      "During an earlier barrage of Iranian missiles on central Israel on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran will stop its strikes if Israel does the same.",
      "But after a day of intensive Israeli aerial attacks that extended targets beyond military installations to hit oil refineries and government buildings, the Revolutionary Guard struck a hard line on Monday, vowing that further rounds of strikes would be \u201cmore forceful, severe, precise and destructive than previous ones.\"",
      "Health authorities also reported that 1,277 were wounded in Iran, without distinguishing between military officials and civilians.",
      "Rights groups, like the Washington-based Iranian advocacy group called Human Rights Activists, have suggested that the Iranian government\u2019s death toll is a significant undercount. Human Rights Activists says it has documented more than 400 people killed, among them 197 civilians.",
      "Israel argues that its assault on Iran's top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists was necessary to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "Iran has always insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not pursued a nuclear weapon since 2003.",
      "But Iran has enriched ever-larger stockpiles of uranium to near weapons-grade levels in recent years and was believed to have the capacity to develop multiple weapons within months if it chose to do so.",

      "President Donald Trump would have unique influence over the operations of U.S. Steel under the terms of the investment being made by Nippon Steel",
      "CALGARY, Alberta -- President Donald Trump would have unique influence over the operations of U.S. Steel under the terms of what the White House calls an \u201cinvestment\u201d being made by Japan-based Nippon Steel in the iconic American steelmaker.",
      "Administration officials over the past few days provided additional insight into the \u201cgolden share\u201d arrangement that the federal government made as a condition for supporting the deal.",
      "The Pittsburgh-based steel maker and Nippon Steel plan $11 billion in new investments by 2028 after indicating that they plan to move forward with the deal under the terms of a national security agreement that has the White House's approval.",
      "The White House has described the deal as a \u201cpartnership\u201d and an \u201cinvestment\u201d by Nippon Steel in U.S. Steel, although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary in a nearly $15 billion offer it originally made in late 2023.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on social media on Saturday how the \u201cgolden share\u201d to be held by the president would operate, revealing that the White House is willing to insert itself aggressively into a private company's affairs even as it has simultaneously pledged to strip away government regulations so businesses can expand.",
      "Under the government's terms, it would be impossible without Trump's consent to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, change the name of the company, \u201ctransfer production or jobs outside the United States,\u201d shutter factories, or reincorporate the business overseas, among other powers held by the president.",
      "Lutnick also said it would require presidential approval to reduce or delay $14 billion in planned investments.",
      "\u201cThe Golden Share held by the United States in U.S. Steel has powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel, and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel,\u201d Lutnick posted on X.",
      "That $14 billion figure is higher than what the companies disclosed on Friday when Trump created a pathway for the investment with an executive order based on the terms of the national security agreement being accepted.",
      "Lawmakers from Pennsylvania say the higher figure includes the cost of an electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that Nippon Steel wants to build in the U.S., bringing the value of the deal to at least $28 billion.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board\u2019s independent three directors and veto power over the other two choices, according to a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Details of the agreement emerged as Trump was traveling to Alberta in Canada for the Group of Seven summit.",
      "Still, the full terms remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel or the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Sunday, the United Steelworkers, the labor union representing U.S. Steel employees, posted a letter raising questions about the deal forged by Trump, who during his run for the presidency had pledged to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.",
      "The union said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Trump \u201chas reversed course\u201d and raised basic questions about the ownership structure of U.S. Steel.",
      "\u201cNeither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOur labor agreement expires next year, on September 1, 2026, and the USW and its members are prepared to engage the new owners\" of U.S. Steel \"to obtain a fair contract.\u201d",
      "If Trump has as much control of U.S. Steel as he has claimed, that could put him in the delicate position of negotiating the salary and benefits of unionized steelworkers going into midterm elections.",
      "As president, Joe Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "After he was elected, Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That's when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel made a series of commitments.",
      "It gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest in U.S. Steel, promised to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \"I am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\"",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2013 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage, and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2013 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller between 2002 and 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women's rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6.",

      "In 2005, Rebecca van Bergen was a graduate student in social work at Washington University when she won $24,000 in a school innovation contest",
      "In 2005, Rebecca van Bergen was a graduate student in social work at Washington University when she won $24,000 in a school innovation contest. That seed money sparked the creation of Nest Inc., a nonprofit that empowers women artisans globally by providing training, funding, and market access.",
      "From its modest beginnings, Nest has grown into a force in the artisan economy. It now supports creators in 125 countries and 47 U.S. states, helping women transition from informal craft work to sustainable business ownership. Nest\u2019s network includes around 3,000 handcraft businesses and has reached more than 345,000 entrepreneurs \u2014 mainly women \u2014 with grants and coaching on skills like pricing and financial management.",
      "\u201cMost people still have an aunt or grandmother who knits or crochets or made them clothes,\u201d van Bergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty deeply embedded in our societies. It\u2019s income-generating, and it also preserves cultures.\u201d",
      "Van Bergen\u2019s first break came in 2010 when Nest partnered with FEED Projects, fashion designer Lauren Bush\u2019s social enterprise. That relationship opened doors to collaborations with Amazon, Etsy, and West Elm. Over the years, Nest\u2019s mission has attracted support from funders like the Oak and Moody\u2019s foundations \u2014 as well retailers like Tory Burch and L.L.Bean, now totaling 25 companies, which purchase and sell the artists\u2019 goods.",
      "From an initial team of two, Nest has grown to 33 staff members, with net assets of $6 million and annual revenue of $7.2 million in 2025 \u2014 nearly double its 2019 revenue. It doesn\u2019t take a cut of artisan sales, relying instead on grants, program service revenue, fundraising events, and individual donations. The organization has received more than $10 million in grant funding since 2017, according to tax information from Cause IQ, which collects nonprofit data.",
      "In recent years, Nest has expanded domestically, providing funds and training artists in all but three U.S. states.",
      "Among the artisans is Stef Ratliff, who was born and raised in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky. She creates custom pottery and art through her KYARTRAT business. Though she had painted trophies for the Americana Music Awards for more than a decade \u2014 and created a custom guitar for Grace Bowers at this year\u2019s Grammys \u2014 Ratliff struggled to run a sustainable business until joining Nest and working as a community manager identifying Appalachian artists.",
      "\u201cI did a business consultation program with them (that) focused on marketing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt taught me I can make the greatest pot or painting of all time, but if I don\u2019t present them in the right light, no one is going to see them properly.\u201d",
      "Working with Nest and connecting to Etsy through a joint program called Uplift Makers was fundamental to setting up an Etsy shop for KYARTRAT, Ratliff said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all reaching new customers through Etsy,\u201d she said, referring to Nest\u2019s eastern Kentucky group of 100 artisans.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s huge for Appalachia,\u201d Ratliff said. \u201cI would never have thought to sell my pottery through Etsy because I felt like a lot of people don\u2019t really care about southern stories and Appalachian stories. I didn\u2019t think they really cared about history.\u201d",
      "Nest\u2019s mission is rooted in van Bergen\u2019s own experience watching her grandmother and great-grandmother sew and quilt. The organization focuses on traditional crafts like basket weaving, ceramics, and candle-making, which are both income-generating and culturally meaningful.",
      "Globally, the handcraft market is valued at $906.8 billion and a vital source of employment, especially for women, according to the data service Research and Markets. Nest helps artisans tap into this market by connecting them to brands like GAP, Ralph Lauren, Target, and Amazon.",
      "In 2021, Nest partnered with Etsy to launch the Uplift Makers Program to support six heritage craft communities, including Gullah basket weavers from South Carolina, quilt makers from the Gee\u2019s Bend area of Alabama\u2019s rural Black Belt region, Afghan refugee craft business owners throughout the United States, Indigenous artisans from the United States and Canada, artisans from Oaxaca, Mexico, and craft makers from Appalachia.",
      "Etsy supported the Gee\u2019s Bend quilters with a $50,000 grant and has since helped over 140 U.S. artisans generate more than $1 million in sales.",
      "Recently, Nest received a $300,000 grant from the Mastercard Impact Fund to bolster its work with Appalachian artisans.",
      "Nest has adapted to economic shifts and policy changes over the years. During the pandemic, it prioritized financial literacy and business development. Now, it\u2019s monitoring global trade policies \u2014 like tariffs \u2014 that could affect both artists and their retail partners.",
      "Nest intentionally chose not to pursue microlending, which was popular among development groups in the early 2000s but sometimes left borrowers in debt. Instead, the organization focuses on partnerships with groups like Indego Africa, which works with over 700 artisans in Ghana and Rwanda. That partnership has helped connect Ghanaian craftswomen to retailers like Tory Burch, which sells their hand-woven straw tote bags for close to $500.",
      "\u201cThose partnerships are super valuable, both to us and to our partners, because the size of those orders tends to be quite large. It could be anywhere from 300 items to 1,500 items,\u201d said Sara Wohlers, Indego Africa\u2019s director of marketing and communications. \u201cThat creates a lot of consistent work for our partners, and consistent income.\u201d",
      "As Nest shifts to more U.S.-focused work, it is helping women who face similar economic barriers.",
      "Among them is Cynthia Main, a Kentucky-based woodworker who has participated in Nest\u2019s Makers Future Fund, a program that provides professional coaching with a $5,000 grant. Main owns Sunhouse Craft, where she sells handmade brooms, dustpans, and other goods. Despite Berea\u2019s status as Kentucky\u2019s folk arts capital, its economy has suffered from industrial closures and persistent poverty \u2014 nearly 1 in 5 residents lives below the poverty line.",
      "Main said Nest helped her overcome many financial and retail obstacles and build a broader client base for her products. She used her $5,000 grant to attend her first wholesale trade show in New York. That exposure helped double her company\u2019s annual profits, from $120,000 to more than $240,000.",
      "\u201cI just think the work that Nest is doing is so important,\u201d Main said. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how being in a rural place, there\u2019s not a lot of help, or a lot of people who understand the uniqueness of a handmade business, and their advice has been so spot on.\u201d",

Over more than six decades, Lauder played a key role in transforming the business from a handful of products sold under a single brand in U.S. stores to a multi-brand global giant. He had held the title of chairman emeritus at the time of his death.",
      "Estee Lauder's products are sold in roughly 150 countries and territories under brand names including Clinique and Aveda, according to the company's latest annual report. The company generated sales of nearly $16 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the filing said.",
      "Estee Lauder went public in 1995, but members of Lauder family still have about 84% of the voting power of common stock, according to the latest annual filing.",
      "Lauder served as president of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. from 1972 to 1995 and as CEO from 1982 through 1999. He was named chairman in 1995 and served in that role through June 2009.",
      "Under his stewardship, Lauder created the company\u2019s first research and development laboratory, brought in professional management at every level, and was the impetus behind The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos.\u2019 international expansion, helping to spearhead the company\u2019s sales and profits exponentially, according to the company.",
      "Lauder led the launch of many brands including Aramis, Clinique, and Lab Series, among others. Until his death, he remained deeply involved in the company\u2019s acquisition strategy, including the acquisitions of such brands as Aveda, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone London and MAC, the company said.",
      "During his years as chairman emeritus, Lauder was closely involved in the business and day-to-day operations and was a constant fixture at its global headquarters in New York and at its stores around the world until the time of his death, the company said.",
      "\u201cThroughout his life, my father worked tirelessly to build and transform the beauty industry, pioneering many of the innovations, trends, and best practices that are foundational to the industry today,\u201d said William P. Lauder, son and chair of the board at The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies in a statement. \u201cHe was the most charitable man I have ever known, believing that art and education belonged to everyone, and championing the fight against diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and breast cancer. \u201d",
      "Lauder was a longtime patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, in 2013, pledged his 78-piece collection of Cubist art to the museum in the largest single philanthropic gift in the museum's history. He later added five major works to that pledged gift, the company said.",
      "In concert with his Cubist collection donation, he helped establish the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art at the Met to support a program of fellowships, focused exhibitions, and public lectures. He also was the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s chairman emeritus and a trustee from 1977 to 2011.",
      "Lauder was married to Evelyn H. Lauder, who had been the senior corporate vice president at the cosmetic company and the founder of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, from 1959 until she passed away in 2011.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2015, Lauder married Judy Glickman Lauder, a philanthropist and internationally recognized photographer.",
      "Lauder was born in 1933 in New York City. He was a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, and the Officer Candidate School of the United States Navy.",
      "Lauder studied at Columbia University\u2019s graduate school of business. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and as a Navy reservist, for which the U.S. Navy Supply Corps Foundation later recognized him with its Distinguished Alumni Award.",
      "In addition to his wife and son William, Lauder is survived by his other son Gary M. Lauder and wife, Laura Lauder; five grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, many stepchildren and step grandchildren, as well as his brother, Ronald S.

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",

      "The tariffs wars involving global economic powerhouses such as the U.S. and China are being felt even in such distinctly local places as your regional amusement park",
      "NEW YORK -- The trade disputes involving global economic powerhouses such as the U.S. and China are being felt even in such distinctly local places as your regional amusement park.",
      "Families who balk at the cost of a summer vacation at big amusement parks like Disney World favor trips to regional parks, which typically are within driving distance, so expensive flights aren\u2019t necessary. But if tariffs lead to economic uncertainty, they may just stay home.",
      "For park owners, tariffs could subject them to extra costs that their customers might not think about. Parts of the rides are made of imported steel that\u2019s currently subject to tariffs. Those prizes and toys people win after they shoot basketballs into a hoop? They usually come from China, which has been subject to varying tariffs.",
      "So far this year, however, there\u2019s been no letdown.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had good crowds, and everyone seems excited to be here,\u201d said Brian Hartley, vice president of Playland\u2019s Castaway Cove, in Ocean City, New Jersey, which boasts 30 rides, miniature golf, go-karts, and other beachfront attractions. \u201cAs long as the weather is good, they\u2019re ready to come down.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s true for park-goer Chris Del Borrello, at Castaway Cove on a bustling June Friday evening with a group of 10 family members, including his four children.",
      "\u201cWe come here every year because it\u2019s so fun, and we build memories every single summer,\u201d he said.",
      "Tariffs loom over the summer tourism industry just as leisure travel is expected to finally get back to prepandemic levels. The U.S. Travel Association expects Americans to take 1.96 billion trips expected this year, up 2% from 1.92 billion last year. Travel spending is also expected to increase 2% year over year.",
      "As park operators prepared for the 2025 summer last year, President Donald Trump unrolled on-again, off-again tariffs against U.S. trade partners that made planning difficult. For instance, proposed tariffs against China started at 10% in February, rose to 20% in March, ballooned to 145% in April, and were reduced to 30% in May. On Wednesday, the Trump administration put the number at 55%.",
      "Hartley said he ordered items like stuffed animals for games from China early to beat the tariffs \u2013 and benefitted from the pause announced in May.",
      "\u201cWe loaded up, we\u2019re tripping over stuff at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to purchase as much stuff as we could to be ready for the season, because that little bit makes a big difference in the bottom line at the end of the day,\u201d he said.",
      "In particular, the park added two new rides this year, but parts were delivered back in the fall.",
      "Not all parks were as fortunate. At Adventureland, in Farmingdale, N.Y., the steel structure for a new ride, Wave Twister, and some China-made game prizes like plush toys and basketballs were affected by tariff costs, said manager Jeanine Gentile.",
      "\u201cWe ordered them months ago before the tariffs were in place, but they typically arrive for delivery at this time of the year, and so obviously the tariffs were in before we received the product,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did have to pay additional for those tariffs in order to get the product.\u201d",
      "So far, the park is absorbing the cost \u2013 they made the decision not to raise ticket prices this year. But that could change next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just sort of felt that if we can do this (not raise prices) for Long Island and for our guests let\u2019s do it, where we can afford it, at least for this season,\u201d said Gentile.",
      "Aside from tariffs, economic uncertainty is the biggest challenge for amusement parks this season.",
      "At Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which is co-owned by country legend Dolly Parton and Herschend Family Entertainment, Director of Communications Pete Owens said they decided to open a week later in March due to concerns about the economy. But so far, attendance at the park, nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains, is up 4% from last year. Attendees are spending but looking for deals.",
      "A promotion giving discount tickets to public employees has proved popular. And Owens is seeing customers purchase tickets for their family closer to their actual visit instead of several days or weeks in advance. Some are even waiting until they\u2019re in the Great Smoky Mountains to decide to buy a ticket.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re all still looking very closely to see what value pricing there is or what opportunities there are,\u201d he said.",
      "The same holds true at Silver Dollar City near Branson, Missouri, an 1880s Western-themed park, which draws its visitors from what president Brad Thomas calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s heartland,\u201d an \u201coval\u201d in the middle of the country, including Minneapolis, Denver and Memphis and Houston, Texas.",
      "\u201cWhat those families tend to say as they visit us is that they want their families just to escape, even though there\u2019s a lot of concerns in every family\u2019s life, they\u2019re all dealing with time pressure and money pressure and inflation pressure and all kinds of other things,\u201d said Thomas.",
      "He said this year families coming to the park are sticking to a plan, moneywise.",
      "\u201cThey have carved the money that they\u2019ll spend in their day with us or their days with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve planned that into their budget.\u201d",
      "Back at Castaway Cove, Hartley said that while the season is going well, he worries about the mood of the consumer as economic uncertainty persists. That could affect trip planning later in the summer.",
      "\u201cPeople that really haven\u2019t already booked a vacation \u2026 it may affect, do they come down here for a weekend? Do they not? Do they come for two days instead of four or five days?\u201d he said. \u201cI think people don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold.\u201d",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Juneteenth celebrations have been scaled back this year due to funding shortfalls as companies and municipalities across the country reconsider their support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Canceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday\u2019s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. The shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.",
      "In Denver, for example, more than a dozen companies backed out of supporting the Juneteenth Music Festival, which is one of the city\u2019s biggest celebrations of the holiday, according to Norman Harris, executive director of JMF Corporation, which puts on the event.",
      "\u201cThere were quite a few sponsors who pulled back their investments or let us know they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t be in a position to support this year,\" said Harris, who has overseen the event for more than a decade.",
      "The festival, which takes place in the historically Black Five Points neighborhood, has been scaled back to one day instead of two because of the budget shortfall. It has only been able to stay afloat thanks to donations from individuals and foundations.",
      "\u201cThankfully, there was a wide range of support that came when we made the announcement that the celebration is in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Juneteenth celebrates the day the last enslaved people in Texas were told they were free on June 19, 1865, two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation.

      "The governor's office in West Virginia stated that the state won\u2019t be hosting any Juneteenth events this year for the first time since 2017 due to a budget deficit. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey last month signed a bill to end all diversity programs.",

      "No-bid contracts with politically connected companies have become crucial to the Republican Trump administration\u2019s push for more space to hold immigrants for deportation",
      "LEAVENWORTH, Kan. -- LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly \u2014 in a building so storied that it inspired the term \u201cthe big house.\u201d",
      "Now Kansas\u2019 oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids.",
      "ICE has cited a \u201ccompelling urgency\u201d for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida.",
      "That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge\u2019s past description of the now-shuttered prison as \u201ca hell hole.\" The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president's unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals.",
      "To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for \u201cimmigration enforcement support teams\u201d to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety.",
      "Just last week , Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants \u2014 and earn $66 million in annual revenue.",
      "\u201cNever in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,\u201d said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders.",
      "A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.",
      "When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and \u2014 if private prison executives' predictions are accurate \u2014 possibly to more than 150,000.",
      "ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without \u201cFull and Open Competition.\u201d",
      "Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE\u2019s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan.",
      "The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn\u2019t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical.",
      "Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements.",
      "\u201cI think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,\u201d he said.",
      "CoreCivic's Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE\u2019s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast.",
      "\u201cThat would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center.",
      "Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth's economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation\u2019s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall.",
      "The Leavenworth area's politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president.",
      "But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn't because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge last week issued an order requiring it.",
      "An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service.",
      "In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d",
      "Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017.",
      "\u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples.",
      "When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican \u2014 who said of the prison: \u201cThe only way I could describe it frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hell hole.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes.",
      "The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon.",
      "During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees' experiences and said the company officials \u201cdo our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.\u201d",
      "Besides CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans.",
      "ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it\u2019s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention.",
      "Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that.",
      "ICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren't sought.",
      "The Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes.",
      "The contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units \u201cneighborhoods\u201d and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly.",
      "The financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Private prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump\u2019s reelection in November, CoreCivic\u2019s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo\u2019s by 73%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the gold rush,\u201d Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. \u201cAll of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you\u2019re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.\u201d",
      "Geo's former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders.",
      "CoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger.",
      "CoreCivic officials said ICE's letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal. The Leavenworth deal is worth $4.2 million a month to the company, it disclosed in a court filing.",
      "Tiefer, who served on an independent commission established to study government contracting for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said ICE is \"placing a very dicey long-term bet\u201d because of its past problems and said ICE is giving CoreCivic \u201cthe keys to the treasury\u201d without competition.",
      "But financial analysts on company earnings calls have been delighted. When CoreCivic announced its letter contracts, Joe Gomes, of the financial services firm Noble Capital Markets, responded with, \u201cGreat news.\"",
      "\u201cAre you hiding any more of them on us?\u201d he asked.",

      "Data released Monday showed retail sales rose 6.4% from a year earlier, helped partly by promotions of products stranded as shipments were suspended due to higher tariffs.",
      "A major online shopping festival also helped entice consumers to spend more. The June 18 shopping extravaganza started last month, with online sellers offering discounts on many products.",
      "But factory output and exports still took a hit from the tariffs, even though many of the increases in import duties have been delayed as Beijing and Washington negotiate a trade deal.",
      "Manufacturing output rose 5.8% in May year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, compared with 6.1% in April and 7.7% in March. Factory activity surged earlier in the year but has slowed as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "China earlier reported its exports to the United States fell 35% in May from a year earlier, while total exports rose 4.8% in May from a year earlier, much lower than economists\u2019 forecasts and down sharply from an 8.1% jump in April.",
      "Overall, economists said the world\u2019s second largest economy had weathered the threat of hikes in tariffs relatively well.",
      "But signs of weakness persist as a slump in the property market has yet to reverse.",
      "Deflation remains an issue, with consumer prices slipping 0.1% in May from a year earlier and 0.2% from the month before.",
      "Investment in real estate fell 10.7% in January-May compared to a year earlier, with housing prices in most cities falling slightly, the report showed.",
      "Spending on factory equipment and other fixed assets rose at a relatively slow 3.7% annual pace, it said.",
      "Apart from the \u201c618\u201d online shopping festival timed to celebrate the June 18, 1998, founding of e-commerce giant JD.com, China\u2019s program to subsidize trade-ins of household appliances, autos and other goods helped boost retail sales.",
      "But while retail sales rose 5% in January-May from a year earlier, consumers remain wary given weakness in the property sector, a vital repository of wealth for most families, Lynn Song of ING Economics said in a report.",
      "May's data was encouraging, she said, \u201cHowever, a more sustainable consumption recovery will likely require a turnaround of consumer confidence, which remains much closer to historical lows than historical averages.\u201d",
      "The threat of higher tariffs that could further disrupt trade between the two biggest economies, remains, with an Aug. 10 deadline for reaching an agreement following talks last week in London.",
      "\u201cWith tariffs set to stay elevated and exporters facing broader constraints, export growth is likely to slow further by year-end,\u201d Zichun Huang of Capital Economics wrote in a commentary.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection.",
      "After 90 days of non-payment, student loan servicers report delinquent, or past-due, accounts to major credit bureaus, which use the information to recalculate the borrower's score. Falling behind on loan payments therefore can affect an individual\u2019s credit rating as severely as filing for personal bankruptcy.",
      "A lower credit score makes it harder or more expensive to obtain car loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto insurance and other financial services at a time when inflation, high interest rates, and layoffs have strained the resources of some consumers.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that in the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more.",
      "Declines that steep may mean the difference between a manageable credit card interest rate and an unmanageable one, or approval or rejection of an application to rent an apartment.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Though payments technically resumed in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024. Last month, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 1 in 4 people with student loan accounts were more than 90 days behind on payments at the end of March.",
      "Kat Hanchon, 33, who works in marketing and higher education in Detroit, was one of them. Hanchon said her score dropped by 57 points as a result of her loans falling delinquent this year. That put her score below 600, or subprime.",
      "When Hanchon received her statement from her loan servicer, her expected monthly payments were higher than before the pandemic-era pause, even though she had enrolled in a repayment plan that takes a borrower's full financial situation into account.",
      "\u201cThey said I now have to pay $358 per month,\" she said. \"I'm not going to be able to pay that. ... But I'm not unusual in the world we're living in right now.\"",
      "Hanchon said she's had to prioritize paying medical expenses \u2014 for a dental crown, a root canal, and an endoscopy \u2014 before she'll be able to consider putting money toward the loans. While her housing situation is secure for the moment, she worries about the annual percentage rate for her credit cards fluctuating.",
      "Lenders, landlords, credit card companies, employers and utility companies all look to consumers\u2019 credit scores to gauge the likelihood of borrowers being able to make regular payments. A higher score typically results in lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms, while a lower score makes it harder to access credit.",
      "The Education Department has said borrowers should receive bills from lenders three weeks before any payments are due, but some people have reported that they have not been notified.",
      "Wait times for calls with loan servicers have been high, and layoffs at the Department of Education have also likely contributed to delayed service, consumer advocates say.",
      "Dom Holmes, 28, who works for a nonprofit in Manheim, Pennsylvania, said he woke up in early May to find his credit score had dropped 60 or 70 points overnight.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden I was delinquent, even though I\u2019d never received notice,\u201d he said.",
      "Holmes has begun the process of appealing the reduction of his credit score, he said. He's been considering a move for professional reasons, and added that he's concerned it could be tough to rent a place to live with his score as it stands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m at the ideal age where I should be starting a family and buying a home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you destroy me financially, what are the chances I\u2019m able to do that and that\u2019s viable for me?\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was the first person in his family to graduate from college, said he still has some outstanding Parent Plus loans, which he intends to keep paying down so that his parents\u2019 credit scores aren\u2019t affected.",
      "He graduated in 2019, shortly before the pandemic, and said he can see how his generation might have difficulty paying off the debt.",
      "\u201cRight as I was entering the workforce, the world really stopped,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThings were really bad for a lot of people for a long time. We\u2019re still coming out of that. And all of a sudden, the switches got turned back on overnight.\u201d",
      "Kevin King, vice president of credit risk at data and analytics company LexisNexis, said he expects the effects of the resumed student loan collections to begin rippling through the U.S. economy in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere were a number of years where it was probably a bad financial strategy to be making student loan payments,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of consumers were confused as various government (policies of forgiveness) were passed and overruled.\u201d",
      "King predicts that student loan payments will move higher in the so-called \u201cpayment hierarchy,\u201d or the order in which consumers make payments, since the government plans to use \u201clevers to compel\" such as wage garnishment and the seizing of tax refunds.",
      "\u201cWhich bill do you pay first, second, and not at all?\u201d King said. \u201cHistorically, student loans are really far down the list. But the government\u2019s being pretty aggressive here in pursuing payment activity in a way that may shift the hierarchy. Consumers might be more willing to go delinquent or default on something like a credit card or installment loan.\u201d",
      "The Federal Reserve of New York study also found that borrowers ages 40 and older were most likely to be delinquent on their loans.",
      "Andrew McCall, 58, of Boise, Idaho, said he has about $30,000 remaining in outstanding loans from earning his computer science degrees. He said he can't afford his monthly payments, which are in the $250-300 range, and worries what a hit to his credit score might mean for all areas of his life.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this economy is driven by debt to begin with causes my score to be paramount no matter what financial decisions I\u2019m making, outside of going to the grocery store,\u201d he said. \u201cMy car, my house... Your credit rating becomes a social stratifier.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s true the offers aren\u2019t quite as broad as on Mother\u2019s Day.",
      "But the spending disparity with Mother's Day may be narrowing, according to the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. The organizations forecast that a record-breaking $24 billion will be spent on Father\u2019s Day this year, surpassing the previous mark of $22.9 billion in 2023. They say consumers plan to spend an average of $199.38 on their dads and father figures this year.",
      "Of course, that still pales in comparison to this year's $259.04 average planned for moms, which totals about $34.1 billion, or $10.1 billion more than Father\u2019s Day spending. That is a 21% smaller gap than the $12.8 billion difference there was between Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day spending in 2023.",
      "Other studies disagree, though. RetailMeNot forecasts a $25 drop in spending for dads this year, down to about $232 per shopper, while moms get an average of $360 per shopper, up $43 this year.",

      "Water guns are back squirting at unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Protesters used water guns against unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca on Sunday as demonstrators marched to demand a rethink of an economic model they believe is fueling a housing crunch and erasing the character of their hometowns.",
      "The marches were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\u201cThe squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\u201d Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \u201cBarcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\u201d",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \u201cbubble tea\u201d spots.",
      "\u201cOur lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\u201d",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \u201cEverywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\u201d The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination\u2019s historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident.\u201d They stuck stickers saying \u201cCitizen Self-Defense,\u201d in Catalan, and \u201cTourist Go Home,\u201d in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel\u2019s doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona\u2019s main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but she said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit (28.3 degrees Celsius) weather.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, thank you sweetheart,\u201d Wanda said to the squirter. \u201cI am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\u201d",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain\u2019s government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \u201cYour Airbnb was my home.\u201d",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb\u2019s general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn\u2019t trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn\u2019t resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn\u2019t just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "Leaders of some of the world\u2019s biggest economic powers arrive in the Canadian Rockies for a Group of Seven summit that's been shadowed by an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s unresolved trade war",
      "KANANASKIS, Alberta -- Leaders of some of the world\u2019s biggest economic powers arrived in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday for a Group of Seven summit, overshadowed by an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s unresolved trade war.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran and Tehran\u2019s retaliation, which appeared to catch many world leaders unawares, is the latest sign of a more volatile world.",
      "Trump in recent days vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a U.S. official told The Associated Press, in an indication of how far Israel was prepared to go.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had discussed efforts to de-escalate the crisis with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders and said he expected \u201cintense discussions\u201d would continue at the summit.",
      "As summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint statement, or communique, at the end of the meeting.",
      "With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral conversations rather than a show of unity.",
      "Trump is the summit wild card. He arrived at the international summit sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\" hat. He was greeted by four Mounties. Looming over the meeting are his inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland on Sunday for a highly symbolic stop on his way to Canada. Macron warned that Greenland is \u201cnot to be sold\u201d nor \u201cto be taken.\"",
      "\u201cEverybody in France, the European Union thinks that Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken,\u201d he said during a news conference, applauded by the local crowd.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Greenland is clearly a wakeup call for all Europeans. Let me tell you very directly that you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Macron added.",
      "Trump's plane landed in Alberta late Sunday. He will have a bilateral meeting with Carney on Monday morning before the summit program begins.",
      "Leaders who are not part of the G7 but have been invited to the summit by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs will continue to be top of mind.",
      "Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter: \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to have to pay.\u2019 But I think we\u2019ll have a few, few new trade deals.\u201d",
      "Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien told a panel this week that if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.",
      "\u201cHe tends to be a bully,\u201d Chr\u00e9tien said. \u201cIf Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally.\u201d",
      "Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position with Canada, the U.K.\u2019s former colony, close ally and fellow Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism \u2014 especially from Canadians \u2014 for failing to address Trump\u2019s stated desire to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told The Associated Press: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the precise conversations I\u2019ve had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth.\u201d",
      "The war in Ukraine will be on the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their bruising Oval Office encounter which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Starmer met with Carney in Ottawa before the summit for talks focused on security and trade, in the first visit to Canada by a British prime minister for eight years.",
      "German officials were keen to counter the suggestion that the summit would be a \u201csix against one\u201d event, noting that the G7 countries have plenty of differences of emphasis among themselves on various issues.",
      "\u201cThe only the problem you cannot forecast is what the president of the United States will do depending on the mood, the need to be in the news,\" said Chr\u00e9tien.",

      "The Trump administration has directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement, an official said Saturday.",
      "The move follows weeks of increased enforcement since Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump's immigration policies, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump's second term.",
      "Tatum King, an official with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, wrote regional leaders on Thursday to halt investigations of the agricultural industry, including meatpackers, restaurants and hotels, according to The New York Times.",
      "A U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to The Associated Press the contents of the directive. The Homeland Security Department did not dispute it.",
      "\u201cWe will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, said when asked to confirm the directive.",
      "The shift suggests Trump's promise of mass deportations has limits if it threatens industries that rely on workers in the country illegally. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he disapproved of how farmers and hotels were being affected.",
      "\u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "While ICE's presence in Los Angeles has captured public attention and prompted Trump to deploy the California National Guard and Marines, immigration authorities have also been a growing presence at farms and factories across the country.",
      "Farm bureaus in California say raids at packinghouses and fields are threatening businesses that supply much of the country\u2019s food. Dozens of farmworkers were arrested after uniformed agents fanned out on farms northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, which is known for growing strawberries, lemons and avocados. Others are skipping work as fear spreads.",
      "ICE made more than 70 arrests Tuesday at a food packaging company in Omaha, Nebraska. The owner of Glenn Valley Foods said the company was enrolled in a voluntary program to verify workers' immigration status and that it was operating at 30% capacity as it scrambled to find replacements.",
      "Tom Homan, the White House border czar, has repeatedly said ICE will send officers into communities and workplaces, particularly in \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit the agency's access to local jails.",
      "Sanctuary cities \u201cwill get exactly what they don\u2019t want, more officers in the communities and more officers at the work sites,\u201d Homan said Monday on Fox News Channel. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest them in the jail, we\u2019ll arrest them in the community. If we can\u2019t arrest them in community, we\u2019re going to increase work site enforcement operation. We\u2019re going to flood the zone.\u201d",

      "The United Airlines-operated Boeing 737 Max 8 departed from Newark International Airport in New Jersey at 11:31 a.m. EDT (1531 GMT) and arrived a little over 4 hours later, at 6:39 p.m. local time (1939 GMT), according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.",
      "A seat cost roughly $1,200.",
      "Saturday's flight marks the first direct passage between the U.S. and the Arctic Island for nearly 20 years. In 2007, Air Greenland launched a route between Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and Kangerlussuaq Airport, some 315 kilometers (196 miles) north of Nuuk. It was scrapped the following year due to cost.",
      "The United Airlines flight took place on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, which was being celebrated in Washington with a controversial military parade that\u2019s part of the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he seeks control of Greenland, a strategic Arctic island that\u2019s a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, and has not ruled out military force.",
      "The governments of Denmark, a NATO ally, and Greenland have said it is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. stepping up intelligence gathering on the mineral-rich island.",
      "United announced the flight in October, before Trump was re-elected. It was scheduled for 2025 to take advantage of the new Nuuk airport, which opened in late November and features a larger runway for bigger jets.",
      "\u201cUnited will be the only carrier to connect the U.S. directly to Nuuk \u2014 the northernmost capital in the world, providing a gateway to world-class hiking and fascinating wildlife under the summer\u2019s midnight sun,\u201d the company said in a statement at the time.",
      "Saturday's flight kicked off the airline\u2019s twice weekly seasonal service, from June to September, between Newark and Nuuk. The plane has around 165 seats.",
      "Previously, travelers had to take a layover in Iceland or Copenhagen, Denmark, before flying to Greenland.",
      "The new flight is beneficial for the island's business and residents, according to Greenland government minister Naaja Nathanielsen.",
      "Tourists will spend money at local businesses, and Greenlanders themselves will now be able to travel to the U.S. more easily, Nathanielsen, the minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, told Danish broadcaster DR. The route is also an important part of diversifying the island's economy, she said. Fishing produces about 90% of Greenland\u2019s exports.",
      "Tourism is increasingly important. More than 96,000 international passengers traveled through the country\u2019s airports in 2023, up 28% from 2015.",
      "Visit Greenland echoed Nathanielsen's comments. The government's tourism agency did not have projections on how much money the new flights would bring to the island.",
      "\u201cWe do know that flights can bring in much more than just dollars, and we expect it to have a positive impact -- both for the society and travellers,\u201d Tanny Por, Visit Greenland's head of international relations, told The Associated Press in an email.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The death toll in floods in South Africa's Eastern Cape province has risen to 86, the police minister said Saturday as rescuers continued to retrieve bodies from the floodwater.",
      "Senzo Mchunu, the country's top law enforcement official, spoke to police rescue teams that have been searching for missing people and recovering bodies in and around the town of Mthatha since the floods hit in the predawn hours of Tuesday.",
      "Mchunu said the floods were a tragedy but urged local residents to ignore what he called inaccurate reports spreading on social media that the disaster was caused by someone opening the sluice gates at a nearby dam, leading to water surging through communities. Mchunu said the Mthatha Dam in question did not have sluice gates.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday during a visit to Mthatha that authorities would investigate if there were any problems with the local dam that might have led to the tragedy.",
      "A wall of water 3-4 meters (10-13 feet) high in places flowed out of the river, the head of the provincial government said, washing away victims with parts of their houses and trapping others inside their homes.",
      "Ramaphosa partly attributed the rains and floods to climate change and said some of South Africa's coastal regions were now constantly vulnerable to weather-related disasters. More than 400 people died in flooding in and around South Africa's east coast city of Durban in 2022, which a study linked to climate change.",
      "The floods in the Mthatha area and a neighboring district caught many people unaware despite weather services issuing warnings last week that an extreme cold front was heading for the region, bringing heavy rains and gale-force winds.",
      "The largely rural region is one of the country's poorest and authorities said communities living in informal housing close to the river were especially vulnerable when it burst its banks. Authorities have been criticized for the rescue response but also for the state of the infrastructure in the area.",
      "Officials believe that people are still missing and the death toll could rise further as rescue teams have been searching through floodwater and damaged homes for nearly a week. One of the bodies retrieved on Saturday was that of a boy that rescuers believed was around 13 or 14 years old.",
      "Many children are among the dead, although authorities haven't given an exact count. Some of the victims were washed up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away from their homes by the floods.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a \u201cnational security agreement\u201d submitted by the federal government.",
      "Trump's order didn\u2019t detail the terms of the national security agreement.",
      "But the iconic American steelmaker and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the U.S. government a \u201c golden share \" \u2014 essentially veto power to ensure the country's national security interests are protected against cutbacks in steel production.",
      "\u201cWe thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,\" the two companies said. \"This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\u201d",
      "The companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\u201d the statement said.",
      "U.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.",
      "The companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the order \u201censures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d",

      "The mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.",
      "U.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.",
      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",
      "Trump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.",
      "\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Consumer sentiment increased in June for the first time in six months, the latest sign that Americans\u2019 views of the economy have improved as inflation has stayed tame and the Trump administration has reached a truce in its trade fight with China.",
      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, jumped 16% from 52.2 to 60.5. The large increase followed steady drops that left the preliminary number last month at the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. Consumer sentiment is still down 20% compared with December 2024.",
      "\u201cConsumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a written statement. \u201cHowever, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy.\u201d",
      "Americans have largely taken a darker view of the economy\u2019s future after President Donald Trump unleashed a wide-ranging trade war, imposing steep tariffs on China, the European Union, and dozens of other countries. Yet in April Trump postponed a set of sweeping tariffs on about 60 nations and last month reached a temporary truce with China, after both sides had sharply ratcheted up tariffs on each other.",
      "The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, released in late May, also increased after five straight declines that were linked to anxiety over tariffs.",
      "U.S. duties remain elevated compared with historical levels, but so far they have not worsened overall inflation. Prices rose just 2.4% in May compared with a year ago, up slightly from 2.3% in April. Still, most economists expect tariffs to hit harder in the coming months.",
      "Consumer confidence is sharply divided by political outlook, with Republicans feeling much better about the economy under Trump than Democrats. Democratic sentiment about the economy was much higher under Biden, while Republican views were low. This month, however, sentiment did improve among supporters of both parties and independents.",
      "Consumers' inflation expectations \u2014 basically a measure of how worried people are about future inflation \u2014 dropped this month, which will be welcomed by the inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve. Inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling, because if people worry price increases will get worse, they can take steps \u2014 such as demanding higher pay \u2014 that push prices even higher.",
      "The Fed meets next week, and is expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged at about 4.3%.",

      "Sweden and the Netherlands say they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands",
      "BRUSSELS -- Less than two weeks before a NATO summit, Sweden and the Netherlands said Friday that they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands.",
      "Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands on June 24-25, where they\u2019re due to agree a new defense spending target. He insists that Europe must look after its own security, while Washington focuses on China and its own borders.",
      "Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that \u201cSweden will reach a new NATO spending target to 5% of GDP, where at least 3.5% of GDP will be allocated towards core defense requirements to fulfill NATO\u2019s new capability targets.\"",
      "\u201cWe are in a specific geographical situation where we need to meet the future threats from Russia,\u201d Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, standing alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO's 32 allies agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their military budgets. But NATO\u2019s new plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investment of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "According to the most recent NATO figures, Sweden was estimated to have spent 2.25% of its GDP on defense last year. The Netherlands spent 2.06%, among 22 of the 32 allies who reached NATO\u2019s old benchmark.",
      "The Dutch caretaker government announced on Friday that it would increase spending on defense to 3.5% of GDP in an effort to meet the 5% goal. It\u2019s not clear where the approximately 18 billion euros ($20 billion) will come from.",
      "Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans called the decision \u201chistoric\u201d and told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that he hoped other NATO countries would also increase their spending.",

    "story": [
      "In landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, a new inland desert fish farm is growing barramundi \u2014 a tropical species native to Australia",
      "DATELAND, Ariz. -- Storks scatter, white against blue water, as Dan Mohring's pickup truck rumbles down the dirt road. He's towing a trailer full of ground-up beef, chicken, fish and nutrient bits behind him, ready to be shot out of a cannon into the ponds below.",
      "It's time to feed the fish.",
      "Mohring fires up the machine and the food flies out in a rainbow arc. Then the water comes alive. Hundreds of thrashing, gobbling barramundi wiggle their way to the surface, all fighting for a piece. Until, in a few months, they will become food themselves.",
      "In the desert of landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, Mainstream Aquaculture has a fish farm where it's growing the tropical species barramundi, also known as Asian sea bass, for American restaurants.",
      "Mainstream sees it as a sustainable alternative to ocean-caught seafood. They say chefs and conscious consumers like that the food has a shorter distance to travel, eliminating some of the pollution that comes from massive ships that move products around the world. And they and some aquaculture experts argue it's efficient to use the water twice, since the nutrient-rich leftovers can irrigate crops like Bermuda grass sold for livestock feed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of water,\u201d said Matt Mangan, head of Australia-based Mainstream\u2019s American business. \u201cWe want to be here in 20 years', 30 years' time.\u201d",
      "But some experts question whether growing fish on a large scale in an arid region can work without high environmental costs.",
      "That question comes down to what people collectively decide is a good use of water. In Arizona, some places manage water more aggressively than others. But the whole state is dealing with the impacts of climate change, which is making the region drier and water only more precious.",
      "The farm uses groundwater, not Colorado River water. It's a nonrenewable resource, and like mining, different people and industries have different philosophies about whether it should be extracted.",
      "\u201cAs long as groundwater is treated as an open resource in these rural parts of Arizona, they\u2019re susceptible to new industries coming in and using the groundwater for that industry,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute.",
      "Some scientists believe aquaculture can play a role in protecting wild ocean ecosystems from overfishing. And it might play at least a small role in smoothing any supply problems that result from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including those that send the U.S. about 80% of its seafood, per the United States Department of Agriculture.",
      "In the greenhouses at University of Arizona professor Kevin Fitzsimmons' lab in Tucson, tilapia circle idly in tanks that filter down into tubs full of mussels and floating patches of collard greens and lettuce. Fitzsimmons mentored the student who started the tilapia farm eventually bought by Mainstream about three years ago where they now raise barramundi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think desert agriculture is going away,\" he said. \u201cObviously, we want to do it as water-efficient as possible.\"",
      "But not everyone agrees it's possible.",
      "\u201cArtificial ponds in the desert are stupid,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at ASU and director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative. He worried about heavy water losses to evaporation.",
      "Mangan says that evaporation hasn't been an issue so much as the loss of heat in the wintertime. That has required pumping more water since its warmth when it arrives at the surface helps keep the barramundi cozy. But Mangan says they've been improving pond design to retain heat better and have found, after the last year of research and development, that they can cut their water requirement by about half as a result.",
      "Plus, he argues, the water coming out of the fish ponds is \"essentially liquid fertilizer,\" and though it's slightly salty, they use it for crops that can tolerate it, like Bermuda grass dairy cows can eat.",
      "But that's supporting the cattle industry, which contributes more than its share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, Famiglietti said.",
      "\u201cDoing two suboptimal things doesn't make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Purple flowers sprout alongside paddle wheels. Fish bones crunch underfoot. The faint odor of brackish water and ammonia catches in the breeze.",
      "Without groundwater, none of it would be possible.",
      "Some farmers in Arizona rely on water from the Colorado River, but many others use well water to irrigate crops like alfalfa for the dairy industry or the lettuce, cucumbers and melons shipped nationwide year-round.",
      "Arizona has seven areas around the state where groundwater is rigorously managed. Dateland doesn't fall into one of those, so the only rule that really governs it is a law saying if you land own there, you can pump a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of groundwater, said Rhett Larson, who teaches water law at ASU.",
      "What might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d depends from crop to crop, and there's really no precedent for aquaculture, an industry that hasn't yet spread commercially statewide.",
      "Using numbers provided by Mainstream, Porter calculated that the fish farm would demand a \u201cvery large amount\u201d of water, on par with a big ranch or potentially even more than some suburbs of Phoenix. And she noted that although the water use is being maximized by using it twice, it's still depleting the aquifer.",
      "When the company scoped out Arizona to expand, Mangan said they didn\u2019t see nearly the same kinds of regulations as back in Australia.",
      "As part of its growth strategy, Mainstream is also hoping to work with other farmers in the area so more can use nutrient-rich fish pond wastewater to produce hay. They say a few have expressed interest.",
      "The seafood industry needs to reduce its reliance on catching small wild fish to feed bigger farmed ones that humans eat, said Pallab Sarker, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies sustainability in the aquaculture industry. He said seabirds and mammals rely on small species like anchovies and mackerel commonly used in fish meal.",
      "\u201cWe should not rely on ocean fish to grow fish for aquaculture to meet the demand for humans,\u201d Sarker said.",
      "Mainstream gets its fish feed from two suppliers, Skretting and Star Milling, but Mangan and Mohring said they didn't know for certain where those suppliers got their base ingredients from.",
      "Fitzsimmons, of the University of Arizona, also pointed out that between pollution, overfishing and oceanfront development for recreation, the commercial fishing industry had already been facing problems. He doesn't think that Trump's moves this spring to open up marine protected areas for commercial fishing will improve that situation the way aquaculture could.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hunting and gathering from the ocean,\u201d Fitzsimmons said.",

      "NASCAR\u2019s first international Cup Series race of the modern era was a cultural experience that brought new fans to the series and provided its competitors with a chance to enjoy a new country",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Despite the handful of industry insiders too scared to leave their hotels in Mexico City, NASCAR\u2019s first international Cup Series race of the modern era was a cultural experience that brought new fans to the series and provided its competitors with a chance to enjoy a new country.",
      "The event had its detractors \u2014 rumors persisted for months that it would be canceled over security concerns or the escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico \u2014 and some NASCAR team members remained critical all the way through Sunday's race.",
      "But was it a success? Even with travel delays, hotel room snafus and confusion over shuttle transportation, it was unequivocally a shining moment for NASCAR.",
      "\u201cEvery single thing about this weekend exceeded my expectations,\u201d said Daniel Suarez, the Monterrey-born NASCAR driver who was the face of the three-day weekend. \u201cThe people, the fans, the sponsors, the excitement, the energy. I had expectations for this weekend... and I can tell you that I personally exceeded those expectations.\u201d",
      "The idea to try the road course at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 host of one of the most popular Formula 1 events on that calendar \u2014 was the brainchild of Ben Kennedy, executive vice president and chief venue and racing innovations officer. The great-grandson of NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. has been aggressive in shaking up a schedule that went to the same tracks on the same weekends for decades.",
      "Bringing the Cup Series to Mexico City \u2014 only the third race outside the U.S. in 77 years \u2014 was a chance to expose stock car racing to a new demographic and give Mexican fans their first chance to see the series race live.",
      "\u201cThis was a historic moment for our sport, for Mexico, and for the global motorsports community,\u201d Kennedy said after Shane Van Gisbergen won Sunday's race to lock the New Zealander into the playoffs.",
      "\u201cOne of the coolest parts about this weekend was seeing the reaction of the fans. I had the opportunity to go into the stands a few times,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe energy and the passion of the fans here is unmatched.\u201d",
      "Kennedy said 90% of those in attendance were from Mexico, with 44% from Mexico City. Most important, there were \u201ca lot of new fans coming out of this weekend.\u201d",
      "Even so, Kennedy could not guarantee another race in Mexico City. FIFA has World Cup games scheduled for this same week next year and there are the logistical issues of finding a date during a packed 38-week schedule.",
      "The cars had to leave Michigan International Speedway immediately after last week's race to make the 40-hour journey across the border, and now must get to Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania in time for this weekend's race.",
      "\u201cI want to go everywhere in the world \u2014 England, Germany, South America, Australia, every where we can go,\u201d said Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon, the vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports. \"The next thing that makes sense in Canada. But we have to figure out the schedule before we do too much of this.",
      "\u201cWe can't do this. Michigan, Mexico City, back to Pocono, can't happen. We're doing it and we're excited to take on the challenge, but it's going to wear on us and I don't think we can do it all back-to-back. So we've got to make some adjustments to the schedule and how do we fit it all in into what's already a very difficult schedule.\u201d",
      "Nothing is off the table for Kennedy, who is globally exploring where NASCAR can race and showcase its product.",
      "One glaring issue: Those in the industry who remain comfortable with the same old schedule of traveling to Bristol, Tennessee, and Martinsville, Virginia, and Darlington Raceway in South Carolina twice a year.",
      "While those markets are tied deeply to NASCAR's Southern roots, there isn't room for growth in playing to the same crowds over and over. The pushback on Mexico City didn't come from any high-profile drivers, but Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s spotter had a scathing social media post ripping the city in which he said \u201cscrew this place, people can talk it up all they want\u201d and 22-year-old driver Carson Hocevar had a similar sentiment in derisive comments on a live stream he has since walked back.",
      "\u201cMaybe a kid that had never been out of the country until Thursday should never give an opinion about what any place is like other than (hometown) Portage, Michigan,\u201d Hocevar posted on social media. \"I was skeptical about the trip and believed everything I read or heard about Mexico City from people who more than likely also had never been here.",
      "\u201cNow that I've actually left my hotel a couple times and raced here in front of some of the most passionate fans I've ever seen, my opinion has changed,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am embarrassed by my comments.\u201d",
      "This was baffling to some of the more well-traveled drivers, including Kyle Larson, who has raced at 200-plus different tracks around the world and makes annual trips to Australia and New Zealand. He also attended the 2021 Formula 1 season finale in Abu Dhabi and then vacationed in Dubai.",
      "He likened Mexico City to a field trip for NASCAR because the drivers all stayed in the same hotels and rode buses together to the circuit each day. On a normal weekend, they are holed up in their motorhomes at the track and rarely venture out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s honestly really fun and enjoyable to be around your competitors and get to know each other a bit better because on a typical weekend, we just kind of lock ourselves in wherever we\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \"We don\u2019t talk to anybody or anything. So it\u2019s nice that, yeah, you\u2019re almost forced to hang out with each other. It\u2019s cool. You get to know them, so I\u2019ve enjoyed that.\u201d",
      "Even Kyle Busch, who was arrested in Mexico in 2023 for carrying a concealed weapon, was surprised by the few who had a negative response to racing in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cThe food is amazing, the city has some of the top restaurants in the world,\u201d Busch said. \u201cThis is a great place to be and I don't understand the people holed up in their hotels too scared to leave. Live a little.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate effort, endeavor, whatever you want to call it,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said after his team lost Game 4. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s long. It\u2019s arduous. But it\u2019s the greatest opportunity going. It\u2019s the greatest opportunity going. It\u2019s really hard, and it\u2019s supposed to be hard. It\u2019s supposed to be hard. This is where we\u2019re going to have to dig in and circle the wagons and come back stronger on Monday.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City is a league-best 44-8 at home this season, including the playoffs. Indiana is seeking its eighth road win of these playoffs, which would tie the Pacers for the second-most in a single postseason. Houston has the record for road wins in one playoff year with nine in its run to the 1995 title.",
      "Game 6 will be in Indianapolis on Thursday night. If a Game 7 is necessary, it will be back in Oklahoma City on Sunday night.",

      "On a day built for umbrellas, J",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Nobody backs their way into a U.S. Open title.",
      "J.J. Spaun wasn't about to be the first to say he did.",
      "On a day built for umbrellas, ponchos and industrial-sized squeegees, Spaun reversed his own free fall, took advantage of several others' and hit two shots that turned him into a major champion while finally, mercifully, creating a moment to remember at the rain-soaked brute called Oakmont.",
      "\u201cI just tried to dig deep,\u201d said the 34-year-old Californian who can now call himself a major champion. \u201cI've been doing it my whole life.\u201d",
      "The shots that will go down in history are the drive he hit on the reachable par-4 17th and the 65-foot putt he sank with the sun going down and the rain falling on 18.",
      "The first set up a birdie that put him in the lead by himself for good. The second was for emphasis \u2014 he needed only a two-putt, after all \u2014 that ensured this U.S. Open would finish with one \u2014 and only one \u2014 player under par.",
      "The 65 footer, the longest of any putt made all tournament, closed out a back nine 32 and left Spaun at 1-under 279 for the tournament. His 72 was the highest closing-round score for a U.S. Open winner in 15 years.",
      "But that wasn't Sunday's takeaway.",
      "Rather, it was the 401.5 feet worth of putts the champion made over four days. And the fact that Spaun joined none other than Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson and Jon Rahm as the fifth U.S. Open winner to finish birdie-birdie.",
      "\u201cI just felt like you keep putting yourself in these positions, like eventually you\u2019re going to tick one off,\u201d said Spaun, whose loss in a playoff to Rory McIlroy three months ago at The Players Championship was his third top-three finish of 2025.",
      "But at the U.S. Open? In that kind of weather?",
      "None of it seemed possible when the rain started coming down during the tail end of a front-nine 40 that took Spaun from one shot back at the start of the day to four behind and fading fast.",
      "A 1-hour, 37-minute rain delay ensued. It was a break that changed everything.",
      "\u201cThey were just like, \u2018Dude, just chill,'\u201d Spaun said of the pep talk he got from his coaches.",
      "They suggested that, if earlier in the week, he'd been told he could be four shots back with nine holes to play, he would have jumped at the chance.",
      "\u201cThey just said: \u2018Just let it come to you, be calm. Stop trying so hard,'\" Spaun said.",
      "Staying calm resulted in making a downhill 40 footer on the par-5 12th for birdie, then a 22-foot birdie on 14 to take the lead by himself for the first time, at even par.",
      "Everywhere else, there were meltdowns in the rain.",
      "Third-round leader Sam Burns thinned a shot out of a divot and over the 11th green en route to the first of two back-nine double bogeys. He shot 40 on the back and finished tied for seventh.",
      "Adam Scott, the only major champion in the top 10 after Saturday's play, shot 41 in the rain on the back nine and dropped to 12th.",
      "\u201cI didn't adapt to those conditions well enough,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Tyrrell Hatton, who shot 72, briefly threatened and was part of a brief five-way deadlock for the lead before making bogey on the last two holes to finish tied for fourth.",
      "Robert MacIntyre turned out to be Spaun's most persistent challenger. The left-hander from Scotland faded his drive just short of the green on the way to birdie on 17 to get to 1 over and set the target for Spaun, who was playing three groups behind.",
      "MacIntyre was waiting in the locker room when Spaun hit his approach on 18 to 65 feet. Everyone knew it was no sure two-putt. Hardly anyone expected Spaun to get down in one.",
      "\u201cTo watch him hole the putt on 12 down the hill there was unreal,\u201d said Viktor Hovland, who played in the twosome with Spaun. \u201cAnd then he makes another one on 14 that was straight down the hill. And then the one on 18, it\u2019s just absolutely filthy there.\u201d",
      "When they close the book on Spaun's victory at this rainy U.S. Open, maybe the most telling story will be about the way his Father's Day began. As much as the front-nine 40, it had to do with the 3 a.m. trip to the drug store for his daughter Violet, who Spaun said was \u201cvomiting all over.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was kind of a rough start to the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming that on my start, but it kind of fit the mold of what was going on, the chaos.\u201d",
      "Then, through all the rain, and through all those bad lies and bad breaks, Spaun brought some order to it all with a drive and a putt that landed him the silver trophy and gold medal that go to U.S. Open winners.",
      "\u201cWe all sacrifice so much to be here, and to see it come to fruition, that's why we do it,\u201d said Spaun's coach, Adam Schriber. \u201cIt's for these moments.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- Jair Cunha and Igor Jesus scored in the first half and Botafogo beat the Seattle Sounders 2-1 at the Club World Cup on Sunday night.",
      "Botafogo opened the scoring 28 minutes into the game as Cunha headed in a pass from Alex Telles. It came after a contentious yellow card to Nouhou Tolo gave the visitors a direct free kick just beyond the corner of the penalty box. Sounders players felt the call was unfair as there had been some unobserved jostling between Tolo and Artur before Tolo shoved his opponent to the ground.",
      "Botafogo doubled the lead in the first half's final minutes with another headed goal. Vitinho connected with his 24-year-old star teammate Igor Jesus, who sent a powerful header to the bottom corner.",
      "The Sounders played better in the second half, buoyed by their energetic subs. Four minutes after coming into the match, Paul Rothrock provided the assist for Christian Roldan\u2019s header in the 75th minute that deflected off Jesus.",
      "The Sounders had two shots on target in a row in the final 30 seconds of stoppage time to try to tie the score, but the first was well blocked by a defender before John smothered Rothrock\u2019s attempt.",
      "Seattle will now have to try to win points off the perceived titans of Group B, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain to avoid going out in the group stage. Botafogo played good defense to hold onto its lead and is second in Group B on goal difference.",
      "\u201cObviously, they\u2019re a great team, and they put us under pressure in moments, but we matched them. The difference in the first half was just quality and a couple of key moments\u2026 I think if you looked at the statistics, you would say that Sounders were in a good spot, but obviously everything is the score line, and we couldn\u2019t find that second goal.\u201d \u2014 Seattle Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer",
      "\u201cThe second half, in terms of our defense, it was not good. We didn\u2019t take possession and \u2026 Seattle scored a goal with some luck, but it was deserved.\u201d \u2014 Botafogo head coach Renato Paiva",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Coastal Carolina's unbeaten Jacob Morrison was dominant into the eighth inning and the Chanticleers capitalized on Oregon State's early mistakes to extend their win streak to 25 games with a 6-2 victory in the College World Series on Sunday night.",
      "Morrison went 7 2/3 innings for his longest outing in over two months. The 6-foot-8, 245-pound right-hander retired 16 straight over the middle innings and left with two outs in the eighth after allowing five hits, walking none and striking out seven.",
      "\u201cFor us to play like that on this stage, pretty darn remarkable,\u201d coach Kevin Schnall said. \u201cThese guys were unbelievable tonight and then Jacob Morrison \u2014 winner's win.\u201d",
      "Coastal Carolina had to win five elimination games on its way to the 2016 national championship in its CWS debut. The Sun Belt Conference's team of teal hadn\u2019t been back to Omaha until this year, and its 2-0 start puts them in control of their bracket.",
      "The Chanticleers (55-11) would advance to the best-of-three finals with another win Wednesday. Their opponent will be either Louisville or Oregon State (48-15-1), which meet in an elimination game Tuesday.",
      "Morrison (12-0) had a 3-0 lead when he went to the mound for the bottom of the first. All three runs were unearned and the result of an unusual sequence of events.",
      "Leadoff man Caden Bodine reached on star shortstop Aiva Arquette\u2019s throwing error \u2014 only his sixth error of the season but second in two games \u2014 and went to second on a balk by Ethan Kleinschmit (8-5). The next batter, Sebastian Alexander, was down 0-2 in the count when he was called out for not being alert to the pitcher, as required, when the 20-second clock hit 8.",
      "Blake Barthol walked and Walker Mitchell and Blagen Pado were hit by pitches, but Pado was called out for not trying to get out of the way. Colby Thorndyke then delivered a two-out, bases-clearing double into the right-center gap.",
      "\u201cWe had a hit by pitch that didn't go our way, which became two outs with bases loaded, and I came up in the same situation earlier in the season and didn't get it done,\u201d Thorndyke said. \u201cI knew if I could get any runs in, and with Jacob on the mound, it would give our dugout confidence.\u201d",
      "Oregon State\u2019s Easton Talt homered leading off the third to make it a two-run game, but the Chanticleers pulled away by scoring on an error and wild pitch in the fourth. It was 6-1 in the fifth when Thorndyke was hit by a pitch and scored from first on Dean Mihos' double.",
      "Morrison's streak of 16 straight retired batters got rolling after Talt's homer and consecutive flies to the warning track by Arquette and Gavin Turley.",
      "\u201cI don't know if I was nervous the first time through the order,\u201d Morrison said, \u201cbut it was awesome seeing long fly balls caught in right and left field. I settled in and was very confident after that.\u201d",
      "The Beavers went into the NCAA Tournament seventh nationally in fielding (.982) with just 35 errors in 54 games. They've committed 10 errors in 10 games since, including five in their first two CWS games.",
      "Two errors on the same play led them to blowing a ninth-inning lead against Louisville in their CWS opener Friday. They survived that, scoring in the bottom of the ninth for a 4-3 walk-off win.",
      "Oregon State wouldn't overcome its two errors, two hit batters, two wild pitches and six walks Sunday. Turley hit his 20th homer leading off the bottom of the ninth against Hayden Johnson, and the Chanticleers had to call on closer Ryan Lynch to get the last out when the Beavers put two runners on base. The Chanticleers improved to 42-0 when leading after six innings.",
      "\u201cSix walks, we can\u2019t do that. Hit by pitch or two, again, that ain't going to work,\" Beavers coach Mitch Canham said. \"Minimizing mistakes is important. I anticipate us going out and playing cleaner baseball Tuesday.\u201d",

      "Famed Oakmont bared its teeth on the back nine at the U.S. Open",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Tyrrell Hatton, in the mix in the final round of a major for the first time in the late Sunday gloom at the U.S. Open, watched his tee shot on the 17th hole drift to the right and exhaled.",
      "If there was a place to \u201cmiss,\u201d Hatton knew it was to the right of the green on the uphill, 314-yard par 4.",
      "And he was right. At just about every place but Oakmont.",
      "When Hatton reached the top of the hill, the fiery Englishman whose emotions are never too far from his sleeve discovered his ball had settled into the course's signature knotty rough on a downslope above a greenside bunker.",
      "Just about anywhere else, the shot rolls into the sand below, and he splashes out with a chance to maybe even take the lead. Only there isn't anywhere else like the iconic links-style course carved out of the Western Pennsylvania hills.",
      "Hatton's pitch from an impossible downhill lie didn't reach the green, and he slammed his club into the ground in protest. A chip and two putts later, he was two back. When his tee shot on the par-4 18th sailed into the rough again, it was over.",
      "\u201cWhat happened on 17 is going to hurt a lot for a long time,\u201d Hatton said after tying for fourth at 3-over 283, four back of winner J.J. Spaun. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019ve been in contention in a major, and that was exciting, and unfortunately, I feel like through a bit of bad luck I had momentum taken away from me and ultimately ended up not being my day.\u201d",
      "Asked about what exactly constituted the \u201cbad luck,\u201d Hatton bristled but only briefly. He'd made his frustration about a course design that includes having most of its 160-plus bunkers well-guarded by an already penal rough well known on Saturday, when he was forced to take an awkward stance to hack out of a sand trap alongside the 15th green on Saturday, leading to a bogey.",
      "What happened in the waning minutes of a rain-delayed and chaos-filled final 18 holes of the championship was just more of the same.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve missed it in the right spot and got punished, which ultimately I don\u2019t think ends up being fair,\u201d Hatton said.",
      "That's Oakmont. Besides, Hatton was hardly the only one who found himself creeping up the leaderboard as the frontrunners faltered, only to ultimately succumb themselves.",
      "Carlos Ortiz, a member of LIV Golf like Hatton, was part of a five-way tie for the lead on the back nine. Ortiz's tee shot on the 503-yard par-4 15th sailed left, forcing him to punch out to the fairway. A wedge from 134 yards landed 40 feet short of the cup. Three putts later, he was on his way to a 3-over 73 finish and a tie for fourth.",
      "\u201cIt was a great week, but obviously I\u2019m disappointed right now the way it happened,\" said Ortiz, who became the first Mexican player since 1972 to place inside the top 10. \u201cI did everything I can.\u201d",
      "Viktor Hovland, who was out on the practice range nearly until dusk on Saturday night trying to find something \u2014 anything really \u2014 to build on, began the day two shots off the lead but never managed to get to pull even with the scrum in front of him.",
      "The Norwegian, who was grouped with Spaun, \u201csaw a lot of stuff\u201d as the leaderboard continued to shuffle and re-shuffle over the final 90 minutes. Keeping track was difficult, particularly with the electronic boards having \u201cdangerous weather\" alerts splashed across them. Ultimately, Hovland couldn't find the rhythm necessary.",
      "Instead, it was Spaun who delivered with a pair of birdies, including a 64-footer on the 18th that immediately etched itself into U.S. Open lore. In a way, the ending helped. Spaun went out and took a tournament up for grabs and grabbed it.",
      "Hovland, who called the last of Spaun's 279 strokes \u201cabsolutely filthy,\u201d had to settle for third, his fourth finish inside the top three at a major. All without being the one standing on the green afterward with the trophy in hand.",
      "Yet he tried to remain upbeat. He believes he's trending back to where he was in 2023, when he finished tied for seventh at the Masters and then tied for second at the PGA a month later. He's already won this year, though he complained about his form afterward.",
      "There was none of that on Sunday. Oakmont is hard enough as it is. No need to pile on.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been tearing myself down a little too much,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cEven though I do know I need to work on some stuff and get back to where I used to be in a way mechanically, but in the interim, I can still perform at a really high level, and there\u2019s a lot of good stuff.\u201d",

      "Robert MacIntyre shot a 2-under 68 in the final round to finish the U.S. Open at 1 over \u2014 two strokes behind winner J",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Robert MacIntyre nearly matched the biggest final-round comeback in U.S. Open history.",
      "Instead, he had to settle for sole possession of second place, but on a day when so many contenders \u2014 including the winner \u2014 had their problems, MacIntyre handled both Oakmont and the weather with aplomb.",
      "MacIntyre shot a 2-under 68 on Sunday to finish the tournament at 1 over \u2014 two strokes behind J.J. Spaun. MacIntyre was seven strokes back of leader Sam Burns at the beginning of the day. He actually made up 10 shots on Burns but couldn't outlast Spaun.",
      "\u201cI think when I was walking up 14 or 12, and I seen a leaderboard that the leader was at even par. I kind of knew where I was at, I was at 3-over, I think, at the time,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThe whole week, I\u2019ve said level par in my head. I\u2019m just looking for four even pars. Almost got there, but not quite.\u201d",
      "As MacIntyre spoke, Spaun was still out on the course. A playoff \u2014 or even an outright victory for MacIntyre \u2014 was still possible. When Spaun rolled in his majestic birdie putt on 18 to finish at 1 under, camera footage showed MacIntyre clapping.",
      "Arnold Palmer is still the only U.S. Open winner to come from seven strokes behind in the final round. He did it in 1960 at Cherry Hills.",
      "Palmer birdied six of his first seven holes that day. MacIntyre's rally was more about staying afloat and waiting for the leaders to fall back. The left-hander from Scotland actually bogeyed two of his first three holes to drop to 5 over, but a 58-foot putt for eagle on the par-5 fourth started him in the right direction.",
      "\u201cThat kind of settled me down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat got me into somewhat of a groove and back in the golf tournament. Then the back nine was just all about fighting.\u201d",
      "MacIntyre said he dried off his shirt and kept stretching during a 97-minute weather delay that interrupted the final round. Down the stretch he was sharp, hitting his tee shot just short of the green on the par-4 17th and moving to 1 over with a birdie there. He had a birdie putt from just over 30 feet on the last hole, but that one didn't drop, and Spaun finished the tournament with two straight birdies to win it.",
      "But MacIntyre did enough to make him earn it. Of the top six finishers, only MacIntyre shot under par on the final day. And the Scot was the only player in the field to shoot under par both Saturday and Sunday.",
      "\"Today was a day that I said to myself, Why not? Why not it be me today?\" he said. \u201cWhen I was going round, and I just trusted myself, trusted my caddie Mike (Burrow), trusted all the work that I\u2019ve done.\u201d",
      "MacIntyre was a member of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team in 2023. He won his first two PGA Tour titles last year at the Canadian Open and Scottish Open.",
      "Although being from Scotland didn't necessarily give him an advantage in the wet weather at Oakmont.",
      "\u201cWhen that rain came on, I wouldn\u2019t be outside. I\u2019d be indoors like you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cFair-weather golfer now that I\u2019ve moved to the PGA Tour.\u201d",

      "The Boston Red Sox have traded Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants in a blockbuster deal",
      "BOSTON -- The Boston Red Sox traded slugger Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday in a deal that could shake up pennant races on both coasts.",
      "San Francisco sent right-hander Jordan Hicks, lefty Kyle Harrison, outfield prospect James Tibbs III and minor league righty Jose Bello to Boston for the 28-year-old designated hitter, who had bristled at his demotion from third base this year.",
      "The Giants are two games back of NL West-leading Los Angeles after losing 5-4 to the Dodgers on Sunday night.",
      "Harrison was on his way to the bullpen to warm up for Sunday's start when he was called back to the clubhouse and informed of the trade. Reliever Sean Hjelle was told about 30 minutes before first pitch that he would start.",
      "\u201cYeah, it was a lot, and it was late, but you know what? This is something we really needed,\u201d Giants manager Bob Melvin said.",
      "\u201cTo get a guy like Devers \u2026 there\u2019s a lot you have to give up for him, but this fits us perfectly. It\u2019s a power left-handed bat, a guy that can go the other way and hit for power in our ballpark. I mean, it\u2019s tailor-made for us, so kudos to the front office to swing this.\u201d",
      "A three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5 million contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston\u2019s 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.",
      "But his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office \u201c should do their jobs \u201d and look for another player.",
      "A day after Devers\u2019 comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora.",
      "The situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained what the team called a significant right quadriceps injury on May 23.",
      "\u201cEverybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers \u2014 he basically was the face of the franchise,\" San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said in an on-field interview during the ESPN broadcast.",
      "Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco\u2019s president of baseball operations in September, said he reached out to Craig Breslow, Boston's chief baseball officer, about two weeks ago. Trade talks picked up momentum over the past few days.",
      "Posey and Melvin declined to address what position Devers would play in San Francisco \u2014 \"That's a conversation for myself, Bob and Zack (general manager Zack Minasian) to have with him,\" Posey said \u2014 but they are convinced Devers' bat will have a significant impact on a lineup that has produced only 16 homers from the left side this season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited about adding one of the best hitters in all of major league baseball to our lineup,\u201d Posey said. \u201cWe're obviously taking on a lot of dollars, but there\u2019s a belief that adding a guy like this puts us in a good position keep winning ballgames, get into the playoffs and try to win a World Series, which is our ultimate goal.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6 1/2 games behind division-leading New York.",
      "Devers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.",
      "The Giants have lacked slugging since Barry Bonds hit 45 homers in 2004; they are the only team in the majors who have not had a batter hit 30 homers since then. Devers has hit at least 30 homers in three different seasons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough losing (Harrison and Hicks) \u2026 but we\u2019re getting a guy back who changes the lineup, who\u2019s probably a top-10 hitter in baseball every year,\u201d Giants pitcher Logan Webb said.",
      "\u201cAny time you add a player of that caliber, I think you give yourself a chance every day.\u2029I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gonna hit, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. The guy\u2019s a stud, plain and simple. I\u2019m excited about it.\u201d",
      "Devers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump -- just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.",
      "But the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 midseason shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop \u2014 and fan favorite \u2014 Nomar Garciaparra.",
      "The Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.",
      "The acquisition of Devers is the latest big move by Posey, 38. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15 million, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182 million, seven-year deal in December.",
      "Harrison, 23, is 9-9 with a 4.48 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 39 games for the Giants over three seasons. Hicks, 28, was 5-12 with a 4.83 ERA and 139 strikeouts in 42 games over two seasons. Tibbs, 22, was the 13th overall pick in last year's draft; he is hitting .246 with 12 homers and 32 RBIs in 57 games for Single-A Eugene of the Northwest League this season. Bello, 20, is 1-0 with a 2.00 ERA in eight games for the Giants' rookie league team in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

      "Connor McDavid scored his first goal of this Stanley Cup Final in Game 5, only after he and the Edmonton Oilers fell behind 3-0 on the way to getting pushed to the brink by the defending champion Florida Panthers",
      "It took until 13 minutes left in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final for Connor McDavid to score his first goal of the series, and it was after he and the Edmonton Oilers fell behind 3-0 to the Florida Panthers, on the way to losing and getting pushed to the brink.",
      "Before that, he led all scorers with six assists, and only teammate Leon Draisaitl has more points than McDavid's seven. Of course, the best hockey player in the world is in the spotlight no matter what he does, and he hasn't been able to break out and put the Oilers on his back thanks in large part to Selke Trophy winner Aleksander Barkov and the Panthers keying in on him defensively and slowing him down at all costs.",
      "Coach Kris Knoblauch thinks it has been a bit of an unfortunate final for McDavid given the amount of scoring chances that just haven't gone in.",
      "\u201cI think Connor\u2019s been one of our best players every single night, and that\u2019s what we expect,\u201d Knoblauch said Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve got no issues with his game. Obviously, our team relies heavily on him and Leon and how they\u2019re playing, but I think that it\u2019s tight checking for everyone and it\u2019s not going to be a midseason game against a non-playoff team when sometimes he\u2019s had 10 or 12 scoring chances. Those numbers are obviously reduced playing against a good team like Florida.\u201d",
      "The Panthers have defended McDavid and Draisaitl \u201creasonably well,\" according to coach Paul Maurice, who acknowledged two of the NHL's most talented forwards are bound to get their opportunities.",
      "Barkov's line, with Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart, has been tasked with playing against McDavid, perhaps to the detriment of offense. That's the job, so Reinhart was noticeably upset to give up that late goal Saturday night.",
      "\"I\u2019m upset every time they get a goal,\" Reinhart told reporters in Edmonton. \"It\u2019s a team effort defending guys like that. We\u2019ve known all series the challenge is there for us. No one really cares in our locker room who\u2019s producing each night. It\u2019s just a matter that someone is at the right times. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "McDavid led all scorers through three rounds playing with Zach Hyman on his right wing. Hyman's right wrist was dislocated with ligaments torn on a hit late in the Western Conference final, and left winger Ryan Nugent-Hopkins was bothered by an undisclosed injury during a stretch against Florida.",
      "Loading up by putting McDavid and Draisaitl on the ice together \u2014 the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 has not been used as often because Hyman isn't around.",
      "\u201cWith the absence of Zach Hyman, it makes it more difficult putting those two together because of the depth of our lineup,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cWith what we have right now, to run those two together for long periods of time makes it more difficult for our depth on our team.\u201d",
      "That puts even more pressure on McDavid in Game 6 on Tuesday night to keep the series going, as the Panthers again focus on preventing him from doing anything of the sort.",

      "Shane Van Gisbergen once again mastered a new track",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Shane Van Gisbergen once again mastered a new track \u2014 this one the iconic Mexico City road course \u2014 to win NASCAR's first Cup Series points-paying race outside the United States of the modern era.",
      "The New Zealander led 60 of 100 laps Sunday at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez to earn his first Cup victory since he won in his NASCAR debut at the inaugural 2023 street course race in Chicago. That victory changed his career trajectory and Van Gisbergen left Australia V8 Supercars, where he was a multiple champion, for a full-time move to NASCAR.",
      "Although he had success in the Xfinity Series \u2014 he won three races last year as Trackhouse Racing developed him for a Cup Series ride \u2014 Van Gisbergen has struggled this year at NASCAR's top level.",
      "He started the race ranked 33rd in the Cup standings with only one top-10 finish through the first 15 races of the season. But his victory in Mexico City earned him an automatic berth into NASCAR's playoffs with a shot to race for the Cup Series championship.",
      "Van Gisbergen benefitted from an early pop-up rain shower on the first lap of the race because he's an exceptionally skilled driver on a wet surface. His win at Chicago was in monsoon-like conditions.",
      "He won the pole in Mexico City and started the race as the BetMGM betting favorite, particularly since rain was in the forecast. He had to contend with several challengers, Ty Gibbs and Christopher Bell of Joe Gibbs Racing among them, but took the lead for good with 31 laps remaining.",
      "Trackhouse now has two of its drivers \u2014 Ross Chastain and Van Gisbergen \u2014 locked into the playoffs. But it was a bit of a disappointment for Daniel Suarez, the Monterrey native who thrilled the hometown crowd with a win in the Xfinity Series race on Saturday, as he failed to challenge his teammate for the win and finished 19th.",
      "Suarez, who appeared to be blinking back tears as he sang along with the Mexican national anthem in pre-race ceremonies, desperately wanted the home win in this contract year with Trackhouse. He was the face of this event as NASCAR ventured outside the U.S. with its top series for the first time since 1958.",
      "Bell finished second in a Toyota for JGR \u2014 16.567 seconds behind the winner. He was followed by Chase Elliott in a Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. Alex Bowman, who hurt his back in a crash last week at Michigan, withstood the pain for a fourth-place finish in his Hendrick Chevrolet.",
      "Michael McDowell of Spire Motorsports was fifth and followed by John Hunter Nemechek in a Toyota for Legacy Motor Club. Chase Briscoe of JGR was seventh and followed by Cole Custer for Haas Factory as the highest-finishing Ford driver. William Byron of Hendrick was ninth and Chris Buescher of RFK Racing rounded out the top 10.",
      "Chevrolets took five of the top-10 positions, including the victory.",
      "Kyle Busch, who started the race at the bottom of the playoff standings, suffered a massive setback when he crashed out of the race on the sixth lap and finished last in the 37-car field.",
      "Busch, who was ranked 15th in the Cup Series standings when he arrived in Mexico City, blamed the incident on the wet track.",
      "\u201cJust in the rain, and I went down into (Turn) 11 and got on the brakes pretty hard, and everything was fine, everything was comfortable, stopped really good,\u201d he said. \"And I\u2019m like \u2018OK I can be a little more aggressive getting into 1,\u2019 and I figured it was going to be fine, and as soon as I went to the brakes, it was like being on ice, and I was just sliding.",
      "\u201cAbout a second a half or so, I was trying to figure out which direction to go, and I was like I\u2019ve got to turn this thing around backward, because I\u2019m going to nail some people. Hate it for all those involved in my mishap. I hate that the rain came and now it\u2019s nice and dry. Just have to go fight for more points in another week.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Shohei Ohtani is going to be the starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night against San Diego, 21 months after the two-way star had elbow surgery.",
      "The Dodgers made the announcement after Sunday night's 5-4 win over San Francisco. Ohtani likely will be used as an opener as the NL West leaders kick off a four-game set against the visiting Padres.",
      "\u201cShohei is getting antsy, which is a good thing for us,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the team announced Ohtani would get the ball on Monday night.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be one or two innings, but my guess is probably an inning to start. But it\u2019s a good thing. The live, simulated, or whatever, sort of ran its course. He\u2019s ready to make his debut on the mound.\u201d",
      "Ohtani has not pitched in a game since Aug. 23, 2023, when he got hurt during a start for the Los Angeles Angels against Cincinnati. He had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018, and is recovering from right elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023.",
      "In the second season of a $700 million, 10-year contract, he paused his pitching work after a mound session on Feb. 25 to prepare for opening day as a hitter, then started bullpen sessions on March 29 and batting practice on May 25.",
      "Roberts said he is excited to see Ohtani pitch in a big league game again.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of anticipation,\u201d he said. \"I think we\u2019ve done it the right way as far as our process, communicating with Shohei and feeling good. ... It\u2019s good for our team. Our guys are excited about this potential. And obviously, most important, I\u2019m excited for Shohei.\u201d",
      "A three-time MVP, Ohtani is hitting .297 with an NL-leading 1.035 OPS, 25 homers and 41 RBIs. A batter only last year in his first season with the Dodgers, Ohtani hit .290 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases.",
      "On Sunday, Roberts said rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki appears likely to be sidelined for a lengthy stretch. With Sasaki (right shoulder impingement), Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Tyler Glasnow (right shoulder inflammation) on the injured list, the Dodgers have resorted to bullpen games.",
      "Sasaki has not pitched in a game since May 9 and is not part of the team\u2019s long-term pitching plans this season.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s what the mindset should be,\u201d Roberts said before the game. \"Being thrust into this environment certainly was a big undertaking for him, and now you layer in the health part and the fact he\u2019s a starting pitcher, knowing what the build-up (required to return) entails \u2026 I think that\u2019s the prudent way to go about it.\u201d",
      "Sasaki, 23, went 1-1 with a 4.72 ERA in eight starts after joining the Dodgers from the Pacific League's Chiba Lotte Marines, averaging less than 4 1/3 innings per start. His walked 22 and struck out 24 in 34 1/3 innings and his fastball averaged 95.7 mph, down 3-4 mph from his average in Japan.",
      "Roberts said Sasaki was pain-free when he resumed throwing in early June, but the pitcher was shut down after feeling discomfort this past week. Sasaki recently received a cortisone injection in the shoulder; Roberts said no further scans are planned.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s pain,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s discomfort, if it\u2019s tightness, if he\u2019s just not feeling strong, whatever the adjective you want to use. That\u2019s more of a question for Roki, as far as the sensation he\u2019s feeling.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just not feeling like he can ramp it up, and we\u2019re not going to push him to do something he doesn\u2019t feel good about right now.\u201d",

      "J",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- J.J. Spaun endured the toughest test in golf on the toughest course in America in the worst kind of conditions. And then he turned this miserable, wet Sunday at Oakmont into a finish as memorable as any in the U.S. Open.",
      "The champion not many expected delivered two shots no one will forget.",
      "First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green for a two-putt birdie that gave him the lead. Then, needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished his storybook Open by holing the longest putt all week at Oakmont for birdie and a 2-over 72.",
      "For all the mess Oakmont became in a series of downpours, for all the bad breaks and bad lies and bad shots that cost so many contenders, Spaun overcame a start that would have ended hopes of more seasoned players and weathered the pressure to claim his greatest prize.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would be here holding this trophy,\u201d said Spaun, who finished last year at No. 119 in the world and moved up to No. 8 with his U.S. Open victory. \"I always had aspirations and dreams. I never knew what my ceiling was. I\u2019m just trying to be the best golfer I can be.",
      "\u201cI'm happy to display that here at Oakmont.\u201d",
      "He finished at 1-under 279, the sole survivor to par, and won by two shots over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland, who watched the finish from a scoring room and could only applaud the stunning conclusion.",
      "Five players shared the lead with an hour to go. Four players were still tied as the U.S. Open made its way to the final four holes that frustrated Sam Burns and Tyrrell Hatton, and crushed the hopes of Adam Scott and Carlos Ortiz.",
      "The last man standing was Spaun, the 34-year-old Californian with an eerie resemblance to the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris.",
      "Never mind that Spaun lacked the pedigree of so many players groomed in elite competition, that he had only one PGA Tour title until Sunday, was playing in only his second U.S. Open and had never cracked the top 20 in his previous eight majors.",
      "The ending was magical. The road leading to his U.S. Open title was hard work and resiliency, especially Sunday. One shot behind to start the final round, he had five bogeys in six holes, including a shot that hit the pin on No. 2 and caromed 35 yards back into the fairway, turning birdie into a bogey.",
      "\u201cIt felt like as bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot. I tried to just continue to dig deep. I\u2019ve been doing it my whole life,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest difference this year has been being able to do that. Fortunately, I dug very deep on the back nine, and things went my way, and here we are with the trophy.\u201d",
      "It was calamity for so many others.",
      "Burns had a two-shot lead going to the 11th tee, made a double bogey from a divot in the first cut on No. 11 and from a lie in the fairway on No. 15 so wet he thought he deserved relief. He shot 78.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tough golf course, and I didn\u2019t have my best stuff, and clearly it showed,\u201d he said.",
      "Scott, trying to become the first player to go more than 11 years between major titles, was tied for the lead with five holes to play. One of the best drivers could no longer find the fairway. He played them in 5 over and shot 79.",
      "\u201cI missed the fairway. I hadn\u2019t done that all week really. Then I did, and I paid the price and lost a lot of shots out there,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Ortiz and Hatton also slashed away in slushy lies, all making mistakes that cost them a chance to survive this beast of day.",
      "The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun.",
      "He was four shots behind and facing the tough ninth hole. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes.",
      "\u201cThe weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,\u201d Spaun said.",
      "Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way.",
      "But oh, that finish.",
      "MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead.",
      "Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner on the 17th, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup.",
      "On the final putt, he was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it dropped as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted.",
      "He raised both arms and tossed his putter, jumping into the arms of caddie Mark Carens.",
      "The celebration carried into those who lost the battle.",
      "Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood.",
      "\u201cUnbelievable. What a putt to win. That\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sad about how I finished, but I\u2019m very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing.\u201d",
      "Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all \u2014 the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start.",
      "\u201cAfter his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,\u201d Hovland said. \"Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn\u2019t expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast.\u201d",
      "Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine. But he missed far too many birdie chances even three-putting from 12 feet no the 11th hole. The world's No. 1 player finished with a 70 to tie for seventh with Jon Rahm (67) and Burns, his best friend who will feel the sting.",
      "He had a double bogey by missing the green into a bad lie on the slope of a bunker. He missed a pair of 6-foot birdie putts to seize control. And when he made a mess of the 15th for another double bogey.",
      "Through it all, Spaun emerged as a U.S. Open champion hardly anyone saw coming \u2014 not at the start of the year, not at the start of the round.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected. Oklahoma City vs. Indiana is a small-market series and the numbers reflect that, with viewership down about 20% from last season and on pace for the poorest TV turnout since the pandemic \u201cbubble\u201d finals in 2020.",
      "Don't blame the Thunder and Pacers for that.",
      "It's been a back-and-forth over the first four games \u2014 and now, a best-of-three will decide the NBA title. Game 5 is in Oklahoma City on Monday night, with the Thunder trying to take their first lead of the series and the Pacers trying to head back home one win away from a championship.",
      "\u201cI do not care, to be honest with you,\" Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said when asked what he'd say to those who, for whatever reason, haven't tuned into the series. \u201cThis is high-level basketball and I'm excited to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Game 1 had a frantic Indiana comeback and a Haliburton buzzer-beater. Game 2 saw Oklahoma City do what it has done in the majority of games all season: take full control early and roll to a win. Game 3 in Indiana had the Pacers' bench fueling a win. And Game 4 saw the MVP do MVP things, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 15 points in the final five minutes to carry the Thunder to a comeback win.",
      "Add it up, and it's Thunder 2, Pacers 2. The Thunder are outscoring the Pacers by 3.3 points per game; the Pacers are outshooting the Thunder by 1.4%. It's only the third time in the last 15 years that the finals have had all that through four games \u2014 2-2 tie, 3.3-point differential or less, shooting within 1.4% of each other. Golden State-Boston had it in 2022, and Dallas-Miami had it in 2011.",
      "It all seems pretty even, and the looks aren't deceiving.",
      "\u201cIt's good for y\u2019all,\" Thunder guard Alex Caruso said. \u201cGood for me, we\u2019d be getting ready for a parade right now.\u201d",
      "Parades in Indianapolis or Oklahoma City are going to have to wait at least until this coming weekend. This series seems like it could have debunked some of the tired complaints about the game in recent years: the nobody-plays-defense, too-much-isolation, too-many-3s arguments that have been out there.",
      "\u201cI think from an outside perspective it\u2019s great for the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for basketball. I think these two teams play stylistically the best versions of basketball right now as far as pressure and being influencing and aggressive on defense \u2014 causing turnovers, making stuff hard and then offensively free-flowing, shot making, passing the ball. ... A great brand of basketball.\u201d",
      "And that means it could end up as a great finals, whether more people start watching or not.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to play this deep into the season,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing this deep into the season, your opponent is going to be really good. They have won 12 games to get to this point just like we have. You just know it\u2019s going to be an unbelievable level. There are definitely times in it where (you're saying), \u2018Man, this is a high, high level.\u2019\"",
      "This marks the 32nd time that a finals has been 2-2 going into Game 5. The winner of Game 5 has gone on to ultimately prevail in 23 of the 31 previous occasions.",
      "\u201cWe are both two games away,\" Haliburton said. \u201cAnything can happen here.\u201d",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.",
      "LeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.",
      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "In his interview with police after he surrendered, the suspect said he also has a YouTube channel and had been livestreaming from the Strip on the night of the shooting. Ruiz told police began shooting because it looked like one of the victims was reaching for a weapon, according to the report.",
      "Police said no firearms were found on the victims.",
      "The shooting happened on one of the busiest stretches of the Strip. The dancing Bellagio fountains, which soar up to 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, play every 15 minutes on the weekends between 8 p.m. and midnight.",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "The Austin rollout also comes after Musk had a public blowup with President Donald Trump over the administration\u2019s tax bill. Some analysts have expressed concern that Trump could retaliate by encouraging federal safety regulators to to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Joe Morelle, the top-ranked Democrat on the House Committee on Administration, want Speaker Mike Johnson to take steps to increase security for House members in Washington and in their districts and to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d money available for members to take additional security precautions in the wake of the shootings of two lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota on Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe strongly urge you to immediately direct the Sergeant at Arms to take all necessary steps to protect House members throughout the country,\u201d Jeffries and Morelle wrote in a joint letter. \u201cAt the same time, it is imperative that we substantially increase the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) to support additional safety and security measures in every single office.\u201d",
      "Senators will be briefed by law enforcement on safety and security on Tuesday. And Democrats in the House, which is on recess this week, are scheduled to receive a virtual briefing from law enforcement officials Tuesday afternoon.",
      "House Republicans held a conference call, which was described as \"tense,\" on Saturday with the House sergeant at arms and U.S. Capitol Police to discuss their concerns, multiple sources familiar with the call told ABC News. Several Republicans said on the one-hour call that they feel unsafe in their home districts and want more protection, sources said.",
      "The key source of contention in particular was the request of police outside their homes at all times and law enforcement authorities saying they need more funding from Congress to provide that.",
      "Senators will be briefed by the Senate sergeant at arms and Capitol Police on Tuesday morning, two sources familiar told ABC News, after it was requested by Majority Leader John Thune and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "House Democrats are expected to have a similar call in the coming days. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement Saturday that he asked the sergeant at arms and Capitol Police to \"ensure the safety\" of the Minnesota delegation and members of Congress \"across the country.\"",
      "While House and Senate leadership are provided with a security detail, rank-and-file members are not routinely protected unless there is a specific threat.",
      "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday that political violence is a \"rampant problem.\" Fellow Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith told NBC News on Sunday, \"I don't want to think that I have to a personal security detail everywhere I go, but I think we really have to look at the situation that we're in.",
      "\"This is no way for our government to work when people, any number of us, feel this kind of threat,\" she said.",

John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in \"political assassinations,\" acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joseph Thompson said Monday.",
      "In a 20-page affidavit, prosecutors outlined how they say Boelter \"embarked on a planned campaign of stalking and violence, designed to inflict fear, injure and kill members of the Minnesota state legislature and their families.\" He allegedly had firearms and a list of 45 elected officials, \"mostly or all Democrats,\" according to prosecutors. Authorities say Boelter traveled to the homes of at least four public officials during the early morning hours of Saturday before the killings.",

      "\"Out of an abundance of caution and to not divert additional law enforcement resources away from protecting the broader public at this time, this is the responsible choice,\u201d Scholten said in a statement.",

The Capitol Police's Threat Assessment Section investigated 9,474 threats and statements in 2024 and 8,008. It investigated 3,939 cases in 2017.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/lawmaker-shootings-minnesota-disturbing-trend-analysis/story?id=122871153",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "The recent shootings of lawmakers in Minnesota are part of a disturbing trend toward politically linked violence, ABC News analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Violence has expanded its scope in recent years.",
      "The shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers has sent shockwaves across the nation. This grim development marks a disturbing escalation: while violence is not new, its recent migration to the state and local level represents a concerning trend.",
      "Violence against public officials has been increasing in recent years, including the two recent assassination attempts in 2024 against President Donald Trump. The 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabby Giffords, initially perceived as an anomaly at the time, now appears to have been a precursor to a rising tide of threats against an expanding sphere of elected officials.",
      "This trend was further highlighted in 2017 when a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, was targeted by an individual motivated by political grievances. Five people were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise, when the gunman unleashed a hail of 70 rounds.",
      "In many of these cases, investigations consistently revealed that the suspects harbored either real or perceived grievances against the politician or their political beliefs, and subsequently acted upon those grievances.",
      "A 2015 study by the U.S. Secret Service, examining attacks against the federal government, shed light on the perpetrators. It found that offenders choose their targets for reasons including retaliation, the furtherance of ideological beliefs, personal gain, or seeking fame and attention. Nearly half of these offenders exhibited evidence of fixation \u2013 an intense or obsessive preoccupation with an individual, activity, or idea. Over half had prior arrests or criminal charges, and more than half had a history of violence towards others.",
      "Furthermore, the study found, almost half communicated their intentions to others about the target or directly with their targets. A third of the offenders made threats or veiled references of harm through online postings, verbal comments, personal manifestos, letters, and other means. Only three offenders communicated threats verbally and in-person directly to their targets.",
      "The 2025 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Homeland Threat Assessment underscored these concerns, stating that \"the 2024 election cycle will be an attractive target for many adversaries.\"",
      "\"Some domestic violent extremists (DVEs) likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election,\" the assessment added.",
      "So, why is this rise in targeted violence occurring?",
      "A June 2024 Chapman University study suggests \"declining levels of confidence in some of our most important social institutions and growing political divisions across society\" as a possible cause. The study notes a steady increase in threats against public officials since 2017, coinciding with a general rise in polarization following the 2016 presidential election. It further posits that \"the growing number of threats may represent a growing tolerance for violence among Americans and the formation of 'a culture that helps normalize their use to express certain ideas and emotions.'\"",
      "The study identifies what it says are significant obstacles to effective responses, including the blurry line between protected speech and criminal threats and the anonymity facilitated by digital technology.",
      "As the study points out, the digital age, with its access to the \"dark web,\" violent online content, and the ease with which individuals can identify public officials, their residences, and their activities, has created unprecedented targeting opportunities. This helps explain the observed increase in violence across all levels of government, including state and local officials, a trend that unfortunately appears to be continuing.",
      "For those in the public sphere, prioritizing personal protection and implementing basic security measures are crucial. These include alarm systems at home, security cameras to identify visitors, and controlling who comes into contact with them. While being a public official and ensuring safety can be conflicting and elusive goals in this climate, these fundamental steps can significantly enhance their security.",
      "Donald J. Mihalek is an ABC News contributor, retired senior Secret Service agent and regional field training instructor who served during two presidential transitions. He was also a police officer and served in the U.S. Coast Guard.",
      "Richard Frankel is an ABC News contributor and retired FBI special agent who was the special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark Division and prior to that, the FBI's New York Joint Terrorism TASK force.",

    "summary": "Senate Finance Committee unveils its proposed changes to the House-passed version of Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which could put the two chambers on collision course.",
    "story": [
      "The House has warned the Senate to stick close to its plan or risk defections.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee unveiled its proposed changes to the House-passed version of President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" on Monday night, which could put the two chambers on a collision course.",
      "The Senate proposal reflects an extension of the Trump 2017 tax cuts, a debt limit increase to avoid a potential default later this summer and cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Senators have been warned by House leaders to make minimal changes to the bill to ensure it can pass, given the razor-thin margin in the lower chamber. There's also a number of senators who have conditioned their support for this bill on certain proposals in the Senate version of the bill.",
      "Senate Republicans were meeting Monday night behind closed doors to go over the proposal.",
      "Here are potential sticking points:",
      "The Senate legislation as drafted would keep the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions at $10,000 a year, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 per year for those making less than $500,000 annually.",
      "Some House Republicans have said they will vote no on the final bill if the deduction is any lower than the $40,000 they painstakingly negotiated.",
      "Senators have said the $10,000 cap is currently just a placeholder, is not finalized, and is still being negotiated. Including a value allows the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to begin scoring the bill, but senators say the score could be modified as the SALT cap changes.",
      "\u201cI called the SALT guys and said, \u2019Hey, don't go nuclear on us\u2019,\u201d said GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who has been a key mediator between the House and Senate. \u201cWe had to put something there because we're still negotiating back and forth.\u201d",
      "Similar to the House\u2019s version, the Senate bill implements work requirements on Medicaid for \u201cable bodied adults who are choosing not to work and do not have dependent children or elderly parents in their care.\u201d",
      "It also increases the frequency of eligibility verifications for able-bodied adults.",
      "Able-bodied adults without dependents can work, participate in a work training program, enroll in school, or volunteer for 20 hours per week in order to receive taxpayer-subsidized Medicaid coverage.",
      "It also ends taxpayer-funded Medicaid payments for abortion services and gender transition procedures and ensures immigrants lacking permanent legal status do not receive Medicaid benefits.",
      "The biggest difference between the House and Senate plans to reduce \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse\u201d in Medicaid involve the provider tax, a state-imposed tax on health care providers used primarily used to help finance state Medicaid programs. Beginning in 2027, the Senate legislation would lower health care provider taxes in states that chose to expand Medicaid to 3.5%, down from 6% in the House bill, which means the burden on states to fund Medicaid could be higher under the Senate\u2019s version.",
      "The Senate\u2019s version permanently extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts, something Senate Republicans say is essential for businesses and families looking to plan for the future.",
      "It also includes no tax on tips and no tax on overtime, a key Trump priority. The bill allows for deductions of up to $25,000 in qualified tips, and deductions of up to $12,500 in overtime. Meanwhile, the House\u2019s version has no explicit cap on tips and overtime deductions.",
      "The Senate\u2019s bill would also offer seniors a new $6,000 tax deduction -- more generous than the $4,000 deduction in the House version.",
      "It would also make permanent various business and other tax incentives, including expensing of investments in equipment and research and development.",
      "The Senate bill pares back the child tax credit from $2,500 in the House version to $2,200 per child. Like the House, it excludes families with no income.",
      "The bill also establishes savings accounts for newborns, similar to the House bill.",
      "The Senate package includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit, higher than the House\u2019s $4 trillion. Congress must act before early fall to raise the debt limit or risk default.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul has made clear he won\u2019t support a package with a debt limit increase. The inclusion of this provision means Republicans will likely lose his vote.",
      "The Senate version phases out solar energy tax credits that were part of the Inflation Reduction Act at a slower rate than the House version by allowing more projects to access the credits before they end.",
      "The Senate bill also eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars of IRA subsidies, such as immediately ending the electric vehicle tax credit and its \u201clease loophole,\u201d similar to the House bill.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",

      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "While plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys say the appeal encompasses at least 10 cases, Chevron disagrees and says the court\u2019s ruling could have broader implications for additional lawsuits.",

      "Attorneys for the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil have asked a federal judge to immediately release him on bail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son",
      "NEW YORK -- Attorneys for the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil requested that a federal judge immediately release him on bail, or else transfer him to New Jersey to be closer to his family, as the Trump administration seeks to keep him in custody in Louisiana.",
      "The latest request, filed Monday afternoon, follows a whirlwind week in the legal case against Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who has been detained since March on allegations that his presence in the country poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy.",
      "While the judge, Michael Farbiarz, ruled that Khalil could not be deported for that reason, he declined Friday to grant Khalil's release, pointing to a secondary rationale advanced by the government: that he had omitted information on his green card application about his work history and affiliations.",
      "In their filing, lawyers for Khalil said the government\u2019s move to keep him detained on those grounds was \u201cexceedingly rare and extremely unusual,\u201d reflecting the retaliatory nature of their case. Khalil has strongly disputed that he was not forthcoming on the application.",
      "If the release is not granted, Khalil\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to at least transfer him to a detention facility in New Jersey so he could be closer to his wife and newborn son.",
      "Their request cited an internal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement directive that says detained parents should be held \u201cas close as practicable\" to their children.",
      "Emailed inquiries to the Justice Department and ICE were not returned.",
      "An ICE official previously denied the transfer request. Last month, the government sought to block Khalil from holding his 1-month-old son, arguing that their first meeting should be \u201cnon-contact.\u201d",
      "Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, was detained at his Manhattan apartment on March 8, becoming the first target of President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on those who joined protests against the war in Gaza.",
      "He has not been accused of a crime. Rather, the Trump administration has argued that Khalil should be expelled from the country for beliefs that could undermine their foreign policy goals around fighting anti-semitism.",
      "The allegations that Khalil lied on his green card application were added after his arrest, and have been strongly contested by Khalil and his lawyers.",
      "While the government claimed he served as an \u201cofficer\u201d of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, Khalil has denied that, claiming he completed an internship at the agency that was approved by Columbia University.",
      "He said the government also overstated the length of time he had worked for the British Embassy.",
      "In a previous ruling, the federal judge said it was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d that the government would seek to detain Khalil solely on charges that he misrepresented himself on the application.",
      "Still, the judge said Khalil\u2019s lawyers had not presented sufficient evidence countering the claims and proving that he was being held illegally.",
      "\u201cThe government is making desperate, last-ditch attempts to keep my husband unjustly imprisoned,\u201d said Noor Abdalla, Khalil\u2019s wife, in a statement Monday. \u201cWe are not afraid and will not be intimidated, because we know, and the government knows, it is only a matter of time before Mahmoud is free.\"",

      "Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions are suing President Donald Trump's administration over requirements in grant applications that they don't promote \u201cgender ideology\u201d or run diversity, equity and inclusion programs or prioritize people in the country illegally.",
      "The groups say the requirements, which Trump ushered in with executive orders, put them in \u201can impossible position.\u201d",
      "If they don't apply for federal money allocated under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, they might not be able to provide rape crisis centers, battered women's shelters and other programs to support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. But if the groups do apply, they said in the lawsuit, they would have to make statements they called \u201cantithetical to their core values\u201d \u2014 and take on legal risk.",
      "In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island on Monday, the coalitions said that agreeing to the terms of grants could open them to federal investigations and enforcement actions as well as lawsuits from private parties.",
      "The groups suing include some from Democratic-controlled states, such as the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, and in GOP-dominated ones, including the Idaho Coalition against Sexual and Domestic Violence.",
      "The groups say the requirements are at odds with federal laws that require them not to discriminate on the basis of gender identity, to aid underserved racial and ethnic groups, and to emphasize immigrants with some programs and not to discriminate based on legal status.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice, which is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The suit is one of more than 200 filed since January to challenge President Donald Trump's executive orders. There were similar claims in a suit over anti-DEI requirements in grants for groups that serve LGBTQ+ communities. A judge last week blocked the administration from enforcing those orders in context of those programs, for now.",

      "The hotly debated project is near the federally protected Okefenokee Swamp.",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- A company that has spent years battling conservationists as it seeks a permit to mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp and its federally protected wildlife refuge needs to do just one thing before regulators make a final decision: set aside $2 million for future restoration of the mining site.",
      "Sixteen months after being notified of the requirement, Twin Pines Minerals still hasn't submitted a surety bond or equivalent financial assurance to show the Georgia Environmental Protection Division that it has access to that amount of cash or credit.",
      "That's brought an unexpected halt to a project that appeared on the cusp of winning final approval early last year. Georgia regulators issued draft permits in February 2024 despite warnings from scientists that mining so close to the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge could irreparably harm a national treasure.",
      "Twin Pines of Birmingham, Alabama, has worked since 2019 to obtain permits to mine titanium dioxide, a pigment used to whiten products from paint to toothpaste, less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the southeastern boundary of the Okefenokee refuge near the Georgia-Florida line.",
      "Within days of the draft permits being approved, Georgia regulators informed Twin Pines in a letter that it needed to submit a $2 million bond, cash or letter of credit that can be used as needed to pay for restoration of the 820-acre (332-hectare) site.",
      "Regulators have finished reviewing thousands of public comments that poured in a year ago regarding the mining project in Georgia's Charlton County, said Environmental Protection Division spokeswoman Sara Lips. Now they're waiting on Twin Pines before moving forward.",
      "\u201cThe financial assurance is the last piece of the permit package that will then get routed to our staff, up to the director, to make a final decision,\" Lips told The Associated Press. She said Twin Pines faces no deadline to put up the money.",
      "Twin Pines President Steve Ingle declined to comment through a company spokesman. Ingle has insisted Twin Pines can mine without harming the Okefenokee. State regulators have agreed, concluding last year that mining should have a \u201cminimal impact\u201d on the refuge.",
      "The mining company's failure to set aside the $2 million after well over a year has opponents questioning whether it has the resources to mine responsibly in an ecologically sensitive area.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about the potential damage of this mine, it goes way beyond $2 million,\" said Peter Slag, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. \u201cIt's sort of an alarm bell that they probably don\u2019t have the money to do other sorts of compliance and capital investment.\u201d",
      "The Okefenokee is the largest U.S. refuge east of the Mississippi River, covering nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) in southeast Georgia. It is home to abundant alligators, stilt-legged wood storks and more than 400 other animal species.",
      "Scientists have warned that mining near the Okefenokee\u2019s bowl-like rim could damage the swamp\u2019s ability to hold water and increase the frequency of withering droughts.",
      "There are other signs Twin Pines may be struggling financially.",
      "Danish shipping company Lauritzen Bulkers sued Twin Pines in federal court in Colorado last October, saying it's owed $9.3 million after contracting with Twin Pines in 2022 to transport minerals to Asia. A judge paused the case in April, at the shipper's request, amid arbitration proceedings.",
      "Twin Pines' attorney in that case, Joseph Martinez, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment.",
      "In March, a second company sued Twin Pines in a California state court. M&L Commodities says Twin Pines owes it $5.6 million stemming from a 2021 contract for M&L to store minerals for the mining company. Twin Pines denies wrongdoing in legal responses filed in court.",

      "Arthur Folasa Ah Loo was killed when a man who was believed to be part of a peacekeeping team for the protest shot at a person brandishing a rifle at demonstrators, accidentally striking Ah Loo. Ah Loo later died at the hospital, authorities said.",
      "Detectives don\u2019t yet know why the alleged rifleman pulled out a weapon or ran from the peacekeepers, but they charged him with murder and accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo\u2019s death, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said at a Sunday news conference.",
      "Ah Loo leaves behind his wife and two young children, according to a GoFundMe for his family that raised over $100,000 in 48 hours.",
      "The \u201cself-taught\u201d fashion designer born in Samoa, known to many as Afa, devoted his life to doing \u201cthe good things for his neighbors and community,\" state Rep. Verona Mauga said.",
      "Mauga was at the \u201cNo Kings Protest\u201d a few blocks from where Ah Loo was shot. She said she only had a sense that something was wrong when she saw the crowd running.",
      "As tragic as his death is, she said, Ah Loo would have been proud that his last moments were spent fighting for what he believed in.",
      "\u201cIf Afa was going to go out any other way than natural causes, it would be standing up for marginalized and vulnerable communities and making sure that people had a voice,\u201d Mauga told The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "While he wasn't typically overtly political, Ah Loo had a knack for connecting \u201cculture and diversity and service,\u201d and bringing people together, Mauga said.",
      "Ah Loo was a co-founder of the nonprofit Create Pacific, which celebrates and uplifts artists from the Pacific Islands. He was working on an upcoming July fashion show when he died.",
      "Ah Loo's vibrant work has earned numerous accolades over the years. He was a contestant in 2017 on Bravo\u2019s \u201cProject Runway,\u201d a reality television show where fashion designers compete in front of celebrity judges to create runway looks on tight deadlines.",
      "Recently, Ah Loo designed a garment for the star of the Disney Channel animated movie Moana 2, Hawaiian actor Auli\u02bbi Cravalho.",
      "Cravalho wore the outfit, which combined traditional and modern aesthetics from her culture, to the film's red carpet premiere in Hawaii last November.",
      "\u201cThis was the first time I was so active in helping to design a custom look, and Afa surpassed what I had envisioned,\u201d Cravalho told the magazine at the time.",
      "But not all of his work was high-profile, Mauga said.",
      "Ah Loo would volunteer his time and resources to tailor clothing for people who needed help, often refusing to let people compensate him for his work, Mauga said. Sometimes, Ah Loo would playfully criticize the outfits the newly elected Democratic representative wore on the campaign trail, and invite her to his studio so he could make her a new set of blazers. He would also make her dresses for events, sometimes just on a couple of hours notice.",
      "\u201cAfa was so much a part of the community,\u201d she said.",

      "The American Red Cross opened a shelter at a high school gymnasium.",
      "Compared to the tourism draw of Lahaina, Kahikinui is less populated and developed. It was used for cattle ranching for many years and is a few miles from the Kahikinui State Forest Reserve, a conservation area",
      "The Kahikinui Kuleana Homestead Program created 104 lots and homesteaders accepted leases of 10 to 20 acres each as of 2011, according to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.",

      "The Lahaina fire, the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century, killed more than 100 people, destroyed thousands of properties and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage.",

      "The flames forced the evacuations of homes that dot the mountains north of Silver City, blocked access to the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument and prompted air quality warnings as smoke drifted north. Campgrounds and access points to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail also were closed.",
      "In Oregon, several dozen homes in Wasco County were destroyed by a fire that started last Wednesday. Some evacuations remained in place, but fire managers said Monday that the threat to structures had diminished.",
      "So far this year, the nation has seen double the number of fires as last year but the acreage is less, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. More than 2,700 wildland firefighters and support personnel were currently assigned to 15 large wildfires across the country.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin dairy farmer alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Monday that the Trump administration is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers by continuing programs that favor minorities.",
      "The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in federal court in Wisconsin on behalf of a white dairy farmer, Adam Faust.",
      "Faust was among several farmers who successfully sued the Biden administration in 2021 for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan.",
      "The new lawsuit alleges the government has continued to implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were instituted under former President Joe Biden. The Wisconsin Institute wrote to the USDA in April warning of legal action, and six Republican Wisconsin congressmen called on the USDA to investigate and end the programs.",
      "\u201cThe USDA should honor the President\u2019s promise to the American people to end racial discrimination in the federal government,\u201d Faust said in a written statement. \u201cAfter being ignored by a federal agency that\u2019s meant to support agriculture, I hope my lawsuit brings answers, accountability, and results from USDA.\u201d",
      "Trump administration spokesperson Anna Kelly did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.",
      "The lawsuit contends that Faust is one of 2 million white male American farmers who are subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA.",
      "The lawsuit names three USDA programs and policies it says put white men at a disadvantage and violate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal treatment by discriminating based on race and sex.",
      "Faust participates in one program designed to offset the gap between milk prices and the cost of feed, but the lawsuit alleges he is charged a $100 administrative fee that minority and female farmers do not have to pay.",
      "Faust also participates in a USDA program that guarantees 90% of the value of loans to white farmers, but 95% to women and racial minorities. That puts Faust at a disadvantage, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Faust has also begun work on a new manure storage system that could qualify for reimbursement under a USDA environmental conservation program, but 75% of his costs are eligible while 90% of the costs of minority farmers qualify, the lawsuit contends.",
      "A federal court judge ruled in a similar 2021 case that granting loan forgiveness only to \u201csocially disadvantaged farmers\u201d amounts to unconstitutional race discrimination. The Biden administration suspended the program and Congress repealed it in 2022.",
      "The Wisconsin Institute has filed dozens of such lawsuits in 25 states attacking DEI programs in government. In its April letter to the USDA, the law firm that has a long history of representing Republicans said it didn't want to sue \u201cbut there is no excuse for this continued discrimination.\u201d",

      "Canceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday\u2019s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. The shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.",

      "The strongest action was in the oil market, where the price of a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude and Brent crude, the international standard surged more than 7%.",
      "Iran is one of the world\u2019s major producers of oil, though sanctions by Western countries have limited its sales. If a wider war erupts, it could slow the flow of Iran\u2019s oil to its customers and keep the price of crude and gasoline higher for everyone worldwide.",
      "Beyond the oil coming from Iran, analysts also pointed to the potential for disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, a relatively narrow waterway off Iran\u2019s coast. Much of the world\u2019s oil that's been pulled from the ground moves through it on ships.",
      "Companies that use a lot of fuel as part of their business and need their customers feeling confident enough to travel suffered some of the sharpest losses. Cruise operator Carnival dropped 4.9%. United Airlines sank 4.4%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell 5%.",
      "They helped overshadow gains for U.S. oil producers and other companies that could benefit from increased fighting between Israel and Iran.",
      "Exxon Mobil rose 2.2%, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.4% because the leaping price of crude portends bigger profits for them.",

      "The price of gold climbed as investors searched for safer places  to park their cash. An ounce of gold added 1.4% on Friday and was holding steady early Monday.",
      "Prices for Treasury bonds will likewise rise when investors are feeling nervous, but Treasury prices fell Friday, which in turn pushed up their yields, in part because of worries that a spike in oil prices could drive inflation higher.",
      "Inflation has remained relatively tame  recently, and it\u2019s near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%, but worries are high that it could be set to accelerate because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "A better-than-expected report Friday on sentiment among U.S. consumers also helped drive yields higher. The preliminary report from the University of Michigan said sentiment improved for the first time in six months after Trump put many of his tariffs on pause, while U.S. consumers\u2019 expectations for coming inflation eased.",
      "On Wall Street, Adobe fell 5.3% even though the company behind Photoshop reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than Wall Street expected. Analysts called it a solid performance but said investors may have been looking for some bigger revenue forecasts for the upcoming year.",

      "It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed \u2014 after Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation",
      "It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed \u2014 after the Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation.",
      "The resulting Juneteenth holiday \u2014 it's name combining \u201cJune\u201d and \u201cnineteenth\u201d \u2014 has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries. In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday \u2014 expanding its recognition beyond Black America.",
      "This year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.",
      "Still, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.",
      "\u201cI don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,\u201d said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \u201cI've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.\u201d",
      "People who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \u201cright\u201d way to celebrate Juneteenth?",
      "For beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:",
      "It depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans\u2019 true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \u201cBlack Codes,\u201d enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.",
      "Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.",
      "Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.",
      "Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question \u2018What is Juneteenth?\u2019\u201d Morial said.",
      "Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn\u2019t learn about it until his 30s.",
      "\u201cI think many folks haven\u2019t known about it \u2014 who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn\u2019t celebrate it,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt was like just a part of history. It wasn\u2019t a celebration of history.\u201d",
      "For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn\u2019t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.",
      "Search online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you\u2019ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth\u2019s history.",
      "The National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.",
      "The red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.",
      "More people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.",
      "Aside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.",
      "In recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.",
      "\u201cI would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,\u201d Morial said. \u201cIf you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.\u201d",
      "Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there\u2019s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you\u2019re not Black. In fact, embrace it.",
      "\u201cI would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn\u2019t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.",
      "\u201cBecause 1776, Fourth of July, where we\u2019re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBlack people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s typical to wish people a \u201cHappy Juneteenth\u201d or \u201cHappy Teenth,\u201d according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.",
      "\u201cYou know how at Christmas people will say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 to each other and not even know each other?\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou can get a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 from everybody. This is the same way.\u201d",

      "Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after Trump expressed alarm about the impact aggressive enforcement is having on those industries, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who spoke only on condition of anonymity.",
      "Protests over federal immigration enforcement raids have been flaring up around the country.",
      "Opponents of Trump's immigration policies took to the streets as part of the \u201cno kings\u201d demonstrations Saturday that came as Trump held a massive parade in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.",
      "Saturday's protests were mostly peaceful.",
      "But police in Los Angeles used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the event ended.",

      "NEW YORK -- The man accused of assassinating the top Democrat in the Minnesota House held deeply religious and politically conservative views, telling a congregation in Africa two years ago that the U.S. was in a \u201cbad place\u201d where most churches didn\u2019t oppose abortion.",
      "Vance Luther Boelter, 57, was captured late Sunday following a two-day manhunt authorities described as the largest in the state's history. Boelter is accused of impersonating a police officer and gunning down former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home outside Minneapolis. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz described the shooting as \u201ca politically motivated assassination.\u201d",
      "Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were shot earlier by the same gunman at their home nearby but survived.",

The list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and health care officials, according to two law enforcement officials who could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.",
      "Both Hortman and Hoffman were defenders of abortion rights at the state legislature.",
      "Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said at a briefing on Sunday that Boelter is not believed to have made any public threats before the attacks. Evans asked the public not to speculate on a motivation for the attacks. \u201cWe often want easy answers for complex problems,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThose answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe churches are so messed up, they don\u2019t know abortion is wrong in many churches,\u201d he said, according to an online recording of one sermon from February 2023. Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.",
      "He appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.",
      "\u201cHe never talked to me about abortion,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIt seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.\u201d",
      "A married father with five children, Boelter and his wife own a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house on a large rural lot about an hour from downtown Minneapolis that the couple bought in 2023 for more than a half-million dollars.",
      "He worked for decades in managerial roles for food and beverage manufacturers before seeking to reinvent himself in middle age, according to resumes and a video he posted online.",
      "After getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master\u2019s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.",
      "After moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.",
      "In that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.",
      "Records show Boelter and his wife started a security firm in 2018. A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter\u2019s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols. The company\u2019s homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and \u201cPraetorian\u201d painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company\u2019s name across the front.",
      "In an online resume, Boelter also billed himself as a security contractor who worked oversees in the Middle East and Africa. On his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he told Chris Fuller, a friend, that he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing on the Congo River, as well as in transportation and tractor sales.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,\u201d he wrote in a message shared with the AP.",
      "But once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities \u2014 a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter \u201cvoluntarily left\u201d that position about four months ago.",
      "\u201cThis is devastating news for all involved,\u201d Koch said, declining to elaborate on the reasons for Boelter\u2019s departure, citing the ongoing law enforcement investigation.",

      "\u201cMay be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\u201d Boelter wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don\u2019t know anything about this. But I love you guys and I\u2019m sorry for the trouble this has caused.\u201d",

      "NEWARK, N.J. -- Two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large, FBI officials said Sunday.",
      "The four men busted out of the Delaney Hall detention center in Newark during reports of disorder there by breaking through an interior wall that led to an exterior one, and were able to escape from a parking lot, according to U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, and Homeland Security officials.",
      "The FBI said Joel Enrique Sandoval-Lopez and Joan Sebastian Castaneda-Lozada were taken back into custody since Friday, while Franklin Norberto Bautista-Reyes and Andres Felipe Pineda-Mogollon were still on the lam. Officials did not immediately say how or where the two who are back in custody were caught. All four men were in the country illegally and had previously been charged with crimes by local police in New Jersey and New York City, Homeland Security officials said.",
      "Sandoval-Lopez, from Honduras, was charged with unlawful possession of a handgun in October and aggravated assault in February, officials said. Castaneda-Lozada, from Colombia, was charged with burglary, theft and conspiracy, authorities said.",
      "Bautista-Reyes, from Honduras, was charged in May with aggravated assault, attempt to cause bodily injury, terroristic threats and a weapon crime. Pineda-Mogollon, from Colombia, was charged with minor larceny and burglary crimes. The FBI has announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of each man.",
      "A spokesperson for the New Jersey public defenders' office, which represented Sandoval-Lopez, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Sunday. Attorney information for the other three men could not be located on online court records.",
      "Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, a Democrat who\u2019s been critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, cited reports of a possible uprising and escape after disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night and protesters outside the center locked arms and pushed against barricades as vehicles passed through gates. Much is still unclear about what unfolded there.",
      "But GEO Group, the company that owns and operates the detention facility for the federal government, said in a statement that there was \u201cno widespread unrest\u201d at the facility.",
      "Delaney Hall has been the site of clashes this year between Democratic officials who say the facility needs more oversight and the Trump administration and those who run the facility.",
      "Baraka was arrested May 9, handcuffed and charged with trespassing. The charge was later dropped and U.S. Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver was later charged with assaulting federal officers stemming from a skirmish that happened outside the facility. She has denied the charges.",

      "A man who was believed to be part of a peacekeeping team for the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest in Salt Lake City shot at a person who was brandishing a rifle at demonstrators, striking both the rifleman and a bystander who later died at the hospital, authorities said Sunday.",
      "Police took the alleged rifleman, Arturo Gamboa, 24, into custody Saturday evening on a murder charge, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said at a Sunday news conference. The bystander was Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39, a fashion designer from Samoa.",
      "Detectives don't yet know why Gamboa pulled out a rifle or ran from the peacekeepers, but they accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death. The Associated Press did not immediately find an attorney listed for Gamboa or contact information for his family in public records.",
      "Redd said the man believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, dressed in a neon green vest, fired three shots from a handgun at Gamboa, inflicting a relatively minor injury but fatally shooting Ah Loo. Redd did not share the man's name.",
      "Volunteer peacekeeping teams are common for protests, said Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for 50501 Movement, which was a partner in the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest. But the organizers ask attendees, including the peacekeepers, not to bring weapons, she said. Still, Parker said they stopped what could've been a larger mass casualty event.",
      "\u201cOur safety team did as best as they could in a situation that is extremely sad and extremely scary,\" said Parker.",
      "Ah Loo, known as Afa, was a husband and father to two children and a fashion designer who leaned into his Samoan heritage, according to a GoFundMe page organized to support his family. Ah Loo founded Creative Pacific, an event celebrating the diversity of the Pacific Islands, with workshops, artists and a fashion runway. He was on Season 17 of the fashion design reality TV show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d",
      "The gunshots sent hundreds of protesters running, some hiding behind barriers and fleeing into parking garages and nearby businesses, police said in a statement. \u201cThat's a gun. Come on, come on, get out,\" someone can be heard saying in a video posted to social media that appears to show the events.",
      "\u201cNo Kings\u201d protests swept across the country on Saturday, and organizers said millions rallied against what they described as President Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies.",
      "Confrontations were largely isolated. In Riverside, California, authorities said a driver of an SUV struck a woman who was participating in a demonstration and sped away. The woman had \u201csignificant injuries\u201d but was stable, police said, adding that they were still searching for the driver.",
      "Outside the Arizona statehouse, a social media video showed protesters Saturday jeering at and then skirmishing with a masked man, who eventually pulled out a handgun, causing the crowd to scatter. Another video showed Arizona Department of Public Safety officers taking the man into custody.",
      "The shooter and another person in a neon vest allegedly saw Gamboa separate from the crowd of marchers in downtown Salt Lake City, move behind a wall and withdraw a rifle around 8 p.m., Redd said.",
      "When the two men in vests confronted Gamboa with their handguns drawn, witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle into a firing position and ran toward the crowd, said Redd.",
      "That's when one of the men dressed in the vests shot three rounds, hitting Gamboa and Ah Loo, said Redd. Gamboa, who police said didn't have a criminal history, was wounded and treated before being booked into jail.",
      "Redd said that the peacekeepers\u2019 actions are also part of the investigation.",
      "Police said they recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask and a backpack at the scene.",

      "Flash flooding caused by torrential rains has killed five people in northern West Virginia and rescue crews are out searching for three other people who are missing",
      "Flash flooding caused by torrential rains killed five people in northern West Virginia and rescue crews were searching for three other people who were missing Sunday as authorities assessed damage to roads, bridges, natural gas lines and other infrastructure.",
      "Officials said 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about a half hour on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cWe almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\u201d Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \u201cDuring this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents. So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \u201cIt happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for 35 years. I\u2019ve seen major floods here in the city and the county. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d",
      "Authorities said vehicles were swept into swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire.",
      "Similarly, swift flash flooding arrived in Marion County, south of Wheeling and Ohio County, early Sunday afternoon, causing extensive damage to bridges, roads and some homes, the county's Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management said in a Facebook post. The county's 911 line has already processed at least 165 calls for service since the storms began.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Marion County Sunday evening.",
      "Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling in the state\u2019s northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday's early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re searching the banks, we\u2019re searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\u201d Blazier said. \u201cWe\u2019re using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we\u2019re trying to recover anybody that\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "There were about 2,500 reported power outages in the county Sunday, Morrisey confirmed in a news release Sunday evening, which updated the number of people confirmed dead to five, with three more missing. He has declared a state of emergency in Ohio County and mobilized the National Guard to support emergency operations.",
      "\"In many respects, this is kind of a unicorn event, because a lot of the rain had very narrow areas and there were roughly 3 to 4 inches of water that fell in the area in less than an hour,\" Morrisey said at a press conference earlier Sunday. \"That\u2019s very, very difficult to deal with.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cYour friends, your neighbors, your first responders and people in the community, they\u2019re out working very hard to find people. That\u2019s our No. 1 task right now, trying to identify anyone who may still be out there.\u201d",
      "The West Virginia rains followed heavy downpours in San Antonio on Thursday that killed 13 people. More than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours in the Texas city, causing fast-rising floodwaters to carry more than a dozen cars into a creek.",

      "The search for the man wanted in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers has led to the discovery of one of the suspect\u2019s vehicles in a rural area outside Minneapolis",
      "BELLE PLAINE, Minn. -- Authorities searched a vehicle on a rural road outside Minneapolis on Sunday that they believe had been used by the man wanted in the shootings of two Democratic lawmakers, as a state on edge struggled to make sense of the brazen political violence that left one leader dead.",
      "Former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday. Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin home, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.",
      "Authorities named 57-year-old Vance Boelter as a suspect, saying he wore a mask as he posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.",
      "More than 24 hours after authorities first confronted him outside Hortman's home, Boelter was still on the loose after fleeing on foot. The FBI issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They circulated a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings.",
      "Investigators found a cowboy hat near the vehicle and were working to determine whether it belongs to Boelter. Law enforcement officers were searching the area, including nearby homes. The officials could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The search was happening in rural Sibley County, roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis, where Boelter had a home with his wife and five children. Residents in the area received an emergency alert about the located vehicle that warned them to lock their doors and cars.",
      "A crowd of officers were seen congregated on a dirt road near the abandoned dark sedan believed to have been used by Boelter. Doors on both sides of the car were splayed open, with discarded items scattered near the vehicle. Some officers broke off and walked into a wooded area off the road. The car was later towed away.",
      "\u201cWe believe he\u2019s somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him,\u201d U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBut right now, everyone\u2019s on edge here, because we know that this man will kill at a second.\u201d",
      "The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned.",
      "Brightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, \u201cYou were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.\u201d",
      "Pam Stein came with flowers and kneeled by the memorial. An emotional Stein called Hortman an \u201cabsolute powerhouse\u201d and \u201cthe real unsung hero of Minnesota government.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe had a way of bringing people to the table and getting things done like no one else could do,\u201d said Stein, a retired lawyer.",
      "The Hoffmans were recovering from surgery, according to their nephew, Mat Ollig.",
      "Authorities have not yet given details on a motive.",
      "A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, the officials said. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about healthcare facilities, according to the officials.",
      "A Minnesota official told the AP that lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The attacks prompted warnings to other state elected officials and the cancellation of planned \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations against President Donald Trump, though some went ahead anyway, including one that drew tens of thousands to the State Capitol in St. Paul. Authorities said the suspect had \u201cNo Kings\u201d flyers in his car.",
      "Law enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, a person familiar with the matter told AP. The person could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other.",
      "Around 6 a.m. Saturday, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn't say what he had done.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way. \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused,\" he wrote in messages viewed by the AP.",
      "Police first responded to reports of gunfire at the Hoffmans\u2019 home shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "Local police from Brooklyn Park were assisting with the call and decided to proactively check on Hortman's home nearby, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said Saturday.",
      "There, they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer leaving the house. Officers confronted him, he fired at them and officers returned fire. The suspect then retreated back into the home and fled on foot, Bruley said. He left behind the vehicle designed to look like a police car where authorities later found writings.",
      "On social media, Gov. Tim Walz remembered Hortman Sunday as, \u201cThe most consequential Speaker in state history.\u201d",
      "Hortman, 55, had been the top Democratic leader in the state House since 2017. She led Democrats in a three-week walkout at the beginning of this year\u2019s session in a power struggle with Republicans. Under a power-sharing agreement, she turned the gavel over to Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth and assumed the title speaker emerita.",
      "Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota\u2019s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions \u2014 and to protect providers who serve them.",
      "The couple had two adult children.",
      "Hoffman, 60, was first elected in 2012 and was chair of the Senate Human Services Committee, which oversees one of the biggest parts of the state budget. He and his wife have one adult daughter.",

      "Goliath, a 517-pound (234-kilogram) Galapagos tortoise at Zoo Miami, became a father for the first time earlier this month, zoo officials said.",
      "\u201cGoliath is my hero, and I am sure he will soon be an inspiration to many others!\u201d Zoo Miami spokesman Ron Magill said in a statement. \u201cHe is living proof that where there is a will, there is a way and to never give up!\u201d",
      "One egg out of a clutch of eight laid on Jan. 27 successfully hatched on June 4, officials said. Besides being Goliath's first offspring, it's also the first time one of the endangered reptiles has hatched at Zoo Miami. The animals' numbers were drastically reduced before the 20th century by human exploitation and the introduction of invasive species to the Galapagos Islands. Modern threats include climate change and habitat loss.",
      "According to Goliath\u2019s official record, he hatched on the island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos on June 15, between 1885 and 1890. The island group is located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, several hundred miles west of mainland Ecuador.",
      "Goliath arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1929 and moved to Zoo Miami in 1981. He has bred with several different females during his time at Zoo Miami, but he has never sired an offspring. The new hatchling's mother, Sweet Pea, is estimated to be between 85 and 100 years old.",
      "Both parents are doing well in their public habitat, officials said. The hatchling appears to be healthy in a separate enclosure. Wild hatchlings are not raised by their parents.",

      "The prospect of a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients is sparking fears",
      "It took Crystal Strickland years to qualify for Medicaid, which she needs for a heart condition.",
      "Strickland, who's unable to work due to her condition, chafed when she learned that the U.S. House has passed a bill that would impose a work requirement for many able-bodied people to get health insurance coverage through the low-cost, government-run plan for lower-income people.",
      "\u201cWhat sense does that make?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about the people who can\u2019t work but can\u2019t afford a doctor?\u201d",
      "The measure is part of the version of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d bill that cleared the House last month and is now up for consideration in the Senate. Trump is seeking to have it passed by July 4.",
      "The bill as it stands would cut taxes and government spending \u2014 and also upend portions of the nation\u2019s social safety net.",
      "For proponents, the ideas behind the work requirement are simple: Crack down on fraud and stand on the principle that taxpayer-provided health coverage isn't for those who can work but aren\u2019t. The measure includes exceptions for those who are under 19 or over 64, those with disabilities, pregnant women, main caregivers for young children, people recently released from prisons or jails \u2014 or during certain emergencies. It would apply only to adults who receive Medicaid through expansions that 40 states chose to undertake as part of the 2010 health insurance overhaul.",
      "Many details of how the changes would work would be developed later, leaving several unknowns and causing anxiety among recipients who worry that their illnesses might not be enough to exempt them.",
      "Advocates and sick and disabled enrollees worry \u2014 based largely on their past experience \u2014 that even those who might be exempted from work requirements under the law could still lose benefits because of increased or hard-to-meet paperwork mandates.",
      "Strickland, a 44-year-old former server, cook and construction worker who lives in Fairmont, North Carolina, said she could not afford to go to a doctor for years because she wasn't able to work. She finally received a letter this month saying she would receive Medicaid coverage, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's already kind of tough to get on Medicaid,\u201d said Strickland, who has lived in a tent and times and subsisted on nonperishable food thrown out by stores. \u201cIf they make it harder to get on, they're not going to be helping.\u201d",
      "Steve Furman is concerned that his 43-year-old son, who has autism, could lose coverage.",
      "The bill the House adopted would require Medicaid enrollees to show that they work, volunteer or go to school at least 80 hours a month to continue to qualify.",
      "A disability exception would likely apply to Furman's son, who previously worked in an eyeglasses plant in Illinois for 15 years despite behavioral issues that may have gotten him fired elsewhere.",
      "Furman said government bureaucracies are already impossible for his son to navigate, even with help.",
      "It took him a year to help get his son onto Arizona's Medicaid system when they moved to Scottsdale in 2022, and it took time to set up food benefits. But he and his wife, who are retired, say they don't have the means to support his son fully.",
      "\u201cShould I expect the government to take care of him?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do expect them to have humanity.\u201d",
      "About 71 million adults are enrolled in Medicaid now. And most of them \u2014 around 92% \u2014 are working, caregiving, attending school or disabled. Earlier estimates of the budget bill from the Congressional Budget Office found that about 5 million people stand to lose coverage.",
      "A KFF tracking poll conducted in May found that the enrollees come from across the political spectrum. About one-fourth are Republicans; roughly one-third are Democrats.",
      "The poll found that about 7 in 10 adults are worried that federal spending reductions on Medicaid will lead to more uninsured people and would strain health care providers in their area. About half said they were worried reductions would hurt the ability of them or their family to get and pay for health care.",
      "Amaya Diana, an analyst at KFF, points to work requirements launched in Arkansas and Georgia as keeping people off Medicaid without increasing employment.",
      "Amber Bellazaire, a policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, said the process to verify that Medicaid enrollees meet the work requirements could be a key reason people would be denied or lose eligibility.",
      "\u201cMassive coverage losses just due to an administrative burden rather than ineligibility is a significant concern,\u201d she said.",
      "One KFF poll respondent, Virginia Bell, a retiree in Starkville, Mississippi, said she's seen sick family members struggle to get onto Medicaid, including one who died recently without coverage.",
      "She said she doesn't mind a work requirement for those who are able \u2014 but worries about how that would be sorted out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to determine who needs it and who doesn't need it,\u201d she said.",
      "Lexy Mealing, 54 of Westbury, New York, who was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021 and underwent a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgeries, said she fears she may lose the medical benefits she has come to rely on, though people with \u201cserious or complex\u201d medical conditions could be granted exceptions.",
      "She now works about 15 hours a week in \u201cgig\u201d jobs but isn't sure she can work more as she deals with the physical and mental toll of the cancer.",
      "Mealing, who used to work as a medical receptionist in a pediatric neurosurgeon\u2019s office before her diagnosis and now volunteers for the American Cancer Society, went on Medicaid after going on short-term disability.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine going through treatments right now and surgeries and the uncertainty of just not being able to work and not have health insurance,\u201d she said.",
      "Felix White, who has Type I diabetes, first qualified for Medicaid after losing his job as a computer programmer several years ago.",

      "Medicaid, meanwhile, pays for a continuous glucose monitor and insulin and funded foot surgeries last year, including one that kept him in the hospital for 12 days.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have afforded that,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have lost my foot and probably died.\u201d",

      "In these times, the fault lines of American life were evident.",
      "\u201cOne nation under distress,\u201d read a sign carried in a crowd of 1,000 protesters on the grounds of Florida\u2019s old Capitol in Tallahassee. Forewarned of a heavy state response if the crowd caused any trouble, organizers implored the peaceful protesters to not so much as jaywalk.",
      "Yet, in his Trump 2024 shirt, retired American Airlines pilot Larry Stallard happily lived out \u201cone thing on my bucket list\u201d from his perch on the parade route. Stallard, 82, came from Kansas City for the event. He declared Trump \u201cone of the best presidents in my lifetime\u201d and concluded, \u201cIt's been a long day, but it's worth it.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks, about eight minutes, were brief for him as he capped the showy parade he had longed for in his first term and, early in his second, finally got.",
      "\u201cThere is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper or Green Beret,\u201d he told the crowd. From Bunker Hill to the mountains of Afghanistan, the president said, \u201cthe Army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage, untold sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Spirited \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests unfolded in cities and towns across the American republic. But in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz asked people to stay away from anti-Trump demonstrations after the assassination of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, by a gunman still on the loose.",
      "In Los Angeles, epicenter of days-long protests sparked by Trump's crackdown on immigrants, police on horseback charged a previously calm crowd, firing tear gas and crowd control projectiles. \"We weren\u2019t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,\u201d said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.",
      "Law enforcement officers in Atlanta deployed tear gas to divert several hundred nonviolent protesters heading toward Interstate 285 in the northern part of the city. In Culpeper, Virginia, one person was struck by an SUV that police say was intentionally accelerated into the crowd as protesters were leaving an event.",
      "In Washington, more than 6,000 soldiers marched in period-by-period uniforms, dating back to the garb of the ragtag Continental Army and the rise of a nation that would become the world\u2019s most potent military power. In the mix: tanks, parachute jumps and flyovers by more than 60 aircraft.",
      "With evening thunderstorms in the forecast, the parade started well ahead of schedule. In the first 40 minutes, it sped through more than 200 years of Army history, from 1775 to 1991.",
      "Vietnam-era helicopters, including the Huey, roared overhead, as did World War II-vintage aircraft. Sherman tanks, used extensively in that war's European theater, rumbled in the procession along with modern machinery. The Army's Golden Knights parachute team jumped early, releasing streaks of red smoke across the sky and making the crowd scream with excitement as they floated to the ground.",
      "At the festival earlier, attendees sported apparel celebrating both the Army and Trump. Vendors moved through the crowd, selling Trump-themed merchandise, while others offered gear commemorating the Army\u2019s milestone.",
      "It was all too much for Wind Euler, 62, who flew from Arizona to join the protesters. \u201cMy father was a Marine in Iwo Jima, and he was a Republican,\" Euler said. \"I think he would be appalled by the fascist display this parade shows.\u201d",
      "In a camouflage jacket and Army baseball hat, Army veteran Aaron Bogner of Culpeper, Virginia, decried how he believes Trump is using the U.S. military to advance a personal agenda. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful,\" Bogner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an engineered birthday party. It\u2019s an excuse to have tanks in your streets like North Korea.\u201d",
      "Above all, Bogner said, he came to protest the deployment of U.S. troops in Los Angeles after lawlessness broke out in pockets of the city along with peaceful demonstrations. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand when it became unpatriotic to protest,\u201d he said.",
      "In Atlanta, police yelled \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and \u201cyou must disperse\u201d into megaphones as they used tear gas to divert protesters off the road. The tear gas caused the crowd to disperse away from the interstate. Two police helicopters flew above as the crowd moved.",
      "Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, used bicycles to corral marchers. After the main \u201cNo Kings\u201d march ended in Charlotte, a second, unpermitted march began, producing a police confrontation.",
      "Officers formed a barricade with bicycles and yelled \u201cmove back\u201d as protesters attempted to march through uptown Charlotte. In response, demonstrators chanted \u201clet us walk\u201d as police continued to shift them back. Protesters also shouted \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and \u201cno more Nazis.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission \u2014 a gamble that is increasingly being tested ahead of the Group of Seven summit beginning Monday in Canada.",
      "He's threatened stiff tariffs in the belief that other nations would crumple. He's mused about taking over Canada and Greenland. He's suggested he will not honor NATO's obligations to defend partners under attack. And he's used Oval Office meetings to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "But many world leaders see fewer reasons to be cowed by Trump, even as they recognize the risks if he followed through on his threats. They believe he will ultimately back down \u2014 since many of his plans could inflict harm on the U.S. \u2014 or that he can simply be charmed and flattered into cooperating.",
      "\u201cMany leaders still seem intimidated by Trump, but increasingly they are catching on to his pattern of bullying,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn places as diverse as Canada, Iran, China and the EU, we are seeing increasing signs that leaders now recognize that Trump is afraid of anything resembling a fair fight. And so they are increasingly willing to stand up to him.\u201d",
      "In the 22 instances in which Trump has publicly threatened military action since his first term, the U.S. only used force twice, according to a May analysis by Shapiro.",
      "Ahead of the G7 summit, there are already signs of subtle pushback against Trump from fellow leaders in the group. French President Emanuel Macron planned to visit Greenland over the weekend in a show of European solidarity. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said the U.S. is no longer the \u201cpredominant\u201d force in the world after Trump's tariffs created fissures in a decades-long partnership between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage,\" Carney said this past week in French. \"Today, that predominance is a thing of the past.\u201d",
      "The new prime minister added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the U.S. became the global hegemon, a position of authority undermined by Trump's transactional nature that puts little emphasis on defending democratic values or the rule of law.",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran has added a new wrinkle to the global picture as the summit leaders gather to tackle some of the world\u2019s thorniest problems",
      "A senior Canadian official said it was decided early on that the G7 won\u2019t be issuing a joint communiqu\u00e9 as it has at past summits \u2014 an indication of how hard it can be to get Trump on the same page with other world leaders. The White House said individual leader statements will be issued on the issues being discussed.",
      "Speaking last month at a conference in Singapore, Macron called France a \u201cfriend and an ally of the United States\u201d but pushed back against Trump's desire to dominate what other countries do. Macron said efforts to force other nations to choose between the U.S. and China would lead to the breakdown of the global order put in place after World War II.",
      "\u201cWe want to cooperate, but we do not want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed, and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\u201d Macron said.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pushed back against Trump's agenda of levying higher tariffs on imported goods, arguing it would hurt economic growth. The Japanese leader specifically called Trump ahead of the summit to confirm their plans to talk on the sidelines, which is a greater focus for Japan than the summit itself.",
      "\u201cI called him as I also wanted to congratulate his birthday, though one day earlier,\u201d Ishiba said.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the summit was an opportunity for Trump to \u201cmend\u201d relationships with other countries so China would be unable to exploit differences among the G7.",
      "She said other foreign leaders are \u201cnot intimidated\u201d by Trump's actions, which could be driving them away from tighter commitments with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe conversations that I\u2019ve had with those leaders suggest that they think that the partnership with the United States has been really important, but they also understand that there are other opportunities,\u201d Shaheen said.",
      "The White House did not respond to emailed questions for this story.",
      "Having originally made his reputation in real estate and hospitality, Trump has taken kindly to certain foreign visitors, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Starmer has sought to keep Trump in line with Europe in supporting Ukraine and NATO instead of brokering any truces that would favor Russia. He has echoed the president\u2019s language about NATO members spending more on defense. But in his Oval Office visit, Starmer also pleased Trump by delivering an invite for a state visit from King Charles III.",
      "The German government said it, too, wanted to send a public signal of unity, saying that while Trump's recent meeting with Merz at the White House went harmoniously, the next test is how the relationship plays out in a team setting.",
      "There will also be other world leaders outside of the G7 nations attending the summit in mountainous Kananaskis, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump dressed down in the Oval Office.",
      "Italy's Meloni has positioned herself as a \u201cbridge\u201d between the Trump administration and the rest of Europe. But Italy\u2019s strong support of Ukraine and Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on European goods have put Meloni, the only European leader to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a difficult position.",
      "Mark Sobel, U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, an independent think tank, said Trump's \u201ctrade policies, backing for right wing European movements, seeming preference for dealing with authoritarians and many of his other actions are alienating our G7 allies,\u201d even if the U.S. president is correct that Europe needs to do more on defense.",
      "But even as other G7 leaders defuse any public disputes with Trump, the U.S. president's vision for the world remains largely incompatible with they want.",
      "\u201cIn short, behind the curtains, and notwithstanding whatever theater, the Kananaskis summit will highlight a more fragmented G7 and an adrift global economy,\" Sobel said.",

      "In the new biography \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\" (Simon & Schuster), Todd S. Purdum explores the impact on American culture by the Cuban-born entertainer who (as husband and business partner of Lucille Ball) changed the rules of TV.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Purdum on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 15!",
      "\"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\"",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",

      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",

    "summary": "Dr. Fiona Havers' resignation follows RFK Jr.'s orders to change the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",
      "The committee's new membership is set to meet next week to vote on updated vaccine recommendations for COVID-19 and RSV, among other diseases.",

    "summary": "The CDC's new \"checklist\" comes amid a deadly year of measles outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area, before a partnership with the hospital ended in 2021.",
      "Ross\u00a0is listed as cosigning an open letter during the COVID-19 pandemic that criticized a study that concluded ivermectin was ineffective for treating the disease. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",
      "\"We oppose this fixation on randomized controlled trials at the expense of other clinical and scientific evidence and urge medical policymakers to restore balance to the practice of medicine,\" the letter said.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "Maryland-based Manta Pharma\u00a0had until Thursday listed\u00a0Ross as a medical adviser. On a LinkedIn\u00a0profile\u00a0that had been linked by the company, Ross said he worked for and served on advisory boards for several medical companies, including \"an investment in a vaccine company.\"",
      "HHS, Havencrest Capital Management and Manta Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. He previously participated in federal panels related to his work, including the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.",
      "Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "A 2023 presentation by Hibbeln about seafood intake in pregnancy listed him as a professor at the University of Bristol and a psychiatrist for California-based Mindful Health Solutions.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year. He said none of his suggestions were among Kennedy's picks.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",
      "In an \"FAQ\" document shared with stakeholder groups, HHS said the department intended \"to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented.\"",

      "The popular retail chain announced Monday that it is entering Chapter 11 protection as part of a restructuring agreement intended to eliminate $2 billion in debt and provide $200 million in capital to aid with the restructuring process.",
      "Twenty-six At Home stores across the U.S. are slated to close, according to the company's court filings.",
      "Owned by Hellman & Friedman, the Plano, Texas-based company, which has been struggling for months amid rising tariffs, entered a forbearance agreement with lenders after it after it missed an interest payment on May 15, Bloomberg\u00a0reported.",
      "As part of the agreement, At Home said it expects to transition ownership of the company to its pool of lenders who are holding more than 95% of the company's debt.",
      "Brad Weston, CEO of At Home said in a statement that the company is \"operating against the backdrop of an increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving trade environment as we navigate the impact of tariffs.\" He added that the steps they are taking \"will improve our ability to compete in the marketplace in the face of continued volatility and increase the resilience of our business for the long term.\"",

      "Originally named Garden Ridge Pottery, the company opened its first store in 1979 in Schertz, Texas. Since then, it has expanded to 260 locations in 40 states. The retail chain sells a variety of home goods items including rugs, furniture, bedding and kitchenware.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in an email that debt is not the only obstacle for At Home. The company is also dealing with a slowdown in consumer demand for home furnishings, \"which is partly a consequence of low consumer confidence and a sluggish housing market,\" he said.",

      "The voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings are taking place at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the company said in its\u00a0statement.

    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0in August that will cost $499. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

      "A mayday call was sent by the flight captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, seconds after the London-bound plane left the runway in Ahmedabad.",
      "Rescue workers and investigators recovered the other black box, the flight data recorder, on Friday. That recorder logs reams of data from the various systems on modern passenger jets, everything from altitude and speed to engine performance. Black boxes are designed to survive crashes and are considered vital to air accident investigators in determining the cause of disasters.",
      "India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the probe into the Thursday crash of flight 171.

      "The decision added drama to the major aerospace industry event, which was already under the shadow of last week's deadly crash of Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.",
      "The booths displayed \"offensive weapons\" that could be used in Gaza - in violation of agreements with Israeli authorities, a French government source told AFP.",
      "The companies - Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Rafael, Uvision, Elbit and Aeronautics - make drones and guided bombs and missiles.",
      "An Israeli exhibitor wrote a message in yellow chalk on one of the walls, saying the hidden defense systems \"are protecting the state of Israel these days. The French government, in the name of discrimination is trying to hide them from you!\"",
      "French official says Israeli \"offensive weapons\" barred amid war in Gaza",
      "French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision during a Monday press conference at the air show.",
      "\"The French government's position was very simple: no offensive weapons at the arms exposition,\" he said. \"Defensive weapons were perfectly acceptable.\"",
      "Bayrou cited the ongoing conflict in Gaza as the rationale behind the ban.",
      "\"Given France's diplomatic choices, in particular the concern, or in any case, very great worries about Gaza, we could not not show that there was a certain distance, which meant that we did not think it acceptable that offensive weapons were in a show like that,\" said Bayrou. \"And as these offensive weapons were not withdrawn [by the Israeli companies], we have temporarily, I hope, closed the stands.\"",
      "At the last Paris Air Show in 2023, Israeli companies - including at least one that was subject to the closure of its stall on Monday - appear to have displayed offensive weapons, including laser-guided bombs and rockets and attack drones.",
      "Aviation news outlet Flight Global reported from the show on Monday that, despite Bayrou's description of a ban on displays of offensive weapons, \"manufacturers from other countries are freely displaying a range of combat aircraft and munitions,\" which it included a display by the French-owned company Dassault Aviation featuring a \"French air force Rafale fighter surrounded by a range of strike munitions.\"",
      "Israel calls France's decision to close stalls \"outrageous and unprecedented\"",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was shocked by the \"outrageous\" closure of the pavilions and said the situation should be \"immediately corrected.\"",

      "The Israeli defense ministry said in a statement that the \"outrageous and unprecedented decision reeks of policy-driven and commercial considerations.\"",
      "\"The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition - weapons that compete with French industries,\" it said. \"This is particularly striking given Israeli technologies' impressive and precise performance in Iran.\"",
      "Israel launched surprise strikes on Iranian military and nuclear sites early on Friday, killing top commanders and scientists, prompting Tehran to hit back with a barrage of missiles.",
      "Arkansas' Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders was at the Paris show on Monday and, speaking with reporters, she called the French officials' decision \"pretty absurd.\" Her father is Mike Huckabee, the current U.S. Ambassador to Israel and a staunch backer of the ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza.",
      "The presence of Israeli firms at Le Bourget, though smaller than in the past, was already a source of tension before the start of the Paris Air Show, because of the conflict in Gaza.",
      "A French court last week rejected a bid by NGOs to ban Israeli companies from Le Bourget over concerns about \"international crimes.\"",
      "Local lawmakers from the Seine-Saint-Denis department hosting the event were absent during Bayrou's visit to the opening of the air show in protest over the Israeli presence.",
      "\"Never has the world been so disrupted and destabilized,\" Bayrou said earlier at a roundtable event, urging nations to tackle challenges \"together, not against each other.\"",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

    "summary": "The Dow dropped more than 750 points Friday as investors fret over the risk of a widening war in the Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks closed lower on Friday and oil prices climbed after a military strike by Israel on Iran stirred investor fears about the risk of war breaking out in the Middle East.",
      "The S&P 500 slid 68 points, or 1.1%, to end the day at 5,977, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 770 points, or 1.8%, to 42,198 points. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.3%.",
      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",
      "The strikes come as President Trump seeks to rein in Iran's nuclear capabilities. The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to meet Sunday in Oman, as part of a series on ongoing talks.",
      "\"The initial market response has been largely contained, but the risk of a broader military conflict certainly cannot be dismissed,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"Iran has begun to retaliate and will continue to do so. This phase of the conflict will likely last several weeks at least.\"",
      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",
      "One concern is that Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic channel through which millions of barrels of oil flow each day. For now, that option may be off the table for now, according to Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial.",
      "\"We think this is unlikely for now given Iran's need to maintain oil sales to China,\" Kerr said in an email.",
      "Iranian crude exports are restricted by Western sanctions and import bans, with China the only recipient of the country's oil. Israel exports only small amounts of oil and and other energy products.",
      "The Middle East tensions also affect markets beyond oil, said Joy Yang, head of index product management at MarketVector Indexes, noting a decline in bitcoin prices and a rally in defense stocks, as airline stocks fall.",
      "Airlines, whose fuel costs depend on global oil prices and whose revenues depend on travel sentiment, experienced sharp losses. United Airlines lost 4.4%, Delta Air Lines gave up 3.8% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings dropped 5%.",
      "Boeing shares fell 1.7% Friday following a\u00a0crash in India\u00a0involving one of its 787-8 Dreamliner planes.",

      "The president signed an executive order that says Nippon can buy the iconic Pittsburgh-based steelmaker as long as both parties sign a \"national security agreement.\"",
      "The two companies announced in a joint statement\u00a0Friday that they agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement, which they said mandates $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "Nippon and U.S. Steel said they expect the deal \u2014 referred to as a partnership \u2014 to be \"finalized promptly.\" They thanked Mr. Trump, saying they \"look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\"",
      "Some details about the Nippon-U.S. Steel partnership are not clear. Mr. Trump said earlier this week\u00a0that the government's golden share would give the United States \"51% ownership\" and \"total control\" over U.S. Steel, but Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia quoted an unnamed Nippon executive who said the company needs \"management freedom\" over the combined company.",
      "Mr. Trump announced he would allow a \"partnership\" between Nippon and U.S. Steel last month.",
      "The deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel has faced tumult and uncertainty since a nearly $15 billion merger was first proposed in late 2023. Former President Joe Biden rejected the deal on national security grounds in the waning weeks of his time in office, but Mr. Trump ordered a new review of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities rather than fully acquiring the company.",
      "U.S. Steel has said the Nippon deal will allow for new investments in the company's aging facilities, including its Mon Valley Works in the Pittsburgh area. If the deal isn't approved, U.S. Steel has warned it may need to move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh and focus on cheaper ways of making steel than Mon Valley's blast furnaces, putting scores of jobs into jeopardy.",
      "But the United Steelworkers union is staunchly opposed to the deal, calling Nippon's promises to invest in steel mills \"public relations\" and accusing the company of job-costing unfair trade practices.",
      "Rival steelmaker Cleveland Cliffs \u2014 whose offer to buy U.S. Steel was rejected \u2014 has also blasted the deal, accusing Nippon of dumping cheap steel in American markets and saying U.S. Steel \"rejected an all-American solution and insisted on pursuing a doomed-to-fail cash out sale.\" In a lawsuit against the government in the waning days of the Biden administration, Nippon and U.S. Steel accused Cleveland Cliffs and the steel union of undermining their planned merger.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports last month.",

      "Rare earth minerals, which are a set of 17 metallic elements, are integral to automobile production, and enable features like windshield wipers, seat belts and speakers to function. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",
      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",
      "\"The centrality of rare earth export restrictions to the trade deal underscores the criticality of minerals to the U.S. economy as well as the severity of the chokehold Beijing holds on global supply chains,\" policy experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a research note.",

    "story": [
      "A California woman is seeking millions in damages from Costco following an incident at one of the discount retailer's stores that she claims left her with lasting injuries.",
      "In a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Alameda on April 29, Sadie Novotny alleges she sustained \"multiple, permanent and severe\" injuries after a heavy liquor cabinet on display at a Costco Wholesale store in Santa Rosa fell on her \"suddenly and without warning.\"",
      "Novotny was shopping at Costco with her husband on March 22 when the alleged incident occurred, according to the lawsuit. Novotny claims she suffered a closed head injury, or traumatic brain injury as a result.",
      "Claude Wyle, an injury attorney and partner at Choulos, Choulos & Wyle who is representing Novotny, told CBS MoneyWatch that Novotny went to the emergency room after the incident and was diagnosed with a mild concussion. She continues to suffer from difficulty finding words, vision problems and headaches, he said.",
      "Novotny is suing Costco for general negligence, premises liability and products liability. Wyle said his client is seeking millions in damages.",
      "Wyle said Costco has a video of the alleged incident that has not been released to him, and which he likely won't see until the formal discovery period of the lawsuit.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "In her complaint, Novotny claims Costco acted negligently by failing to fix the dangerous conditions that led to the alleged incident. The lawsuit also alleges that the discount retailer failed to adequately train its employees to properly maintain merchandise and that each one bears some blame for Novotny's injuries.",
      "\"The negligent conduct of defendants and each of them was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's injuries,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "The lawsuit was moved to the U.S. District Court for Northern California last week at the request of Costco, Wyle said.",

    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",

We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",

      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",

      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",

      "Americans often voice frustration\u00a0over the ubiquity of tipping these days, but that hasn't stopped them from giving generously to reward good service.",
      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most.",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, LendingTree found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more. LendingTree also looked at which Americans around the country drop the biggest tips.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",

      "Consumers are finally getting a break when it comes to egg prices.",
      "Egg prices dropped to $4.55 in May, down 11% from $5.12 in April, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price drop for a dozen Grade A large eggs comes as the effects of a years-long, widespread avian flu outbreak recede and demand for eggs eases, as it usually does this time of year.",
      "\"There are two main drivers behind the drop in prices \u2014 abatement in the conversation about bird flu, and some seasonality in uses of eggs. Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",
      "While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, down from $6.23 a dozen in March, they remain elevated compared with 12 months ago. In May 2024, a dozen eggs cost $2.70.",
      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices began to decrease in March, according to Ortega, and the price drops are now starting to show up at the retail level.",
      "\"There's a bit of a lag before they reach consumers at the grocery store,\" he said.",
      "Yet the bird flu outbreak, which began in the spring of 2022, is not yet entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, Ortega cautioned. \"It's still very much an issue.\"",
      "A May outbreak at an Arizona layer farm affected nearly 1.4 million birds, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Consumer Price Index data shows that while overall food costs rose slightly in May, egg prices dropped.",

      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",

      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

      "The president and other American officials have said publicly and privately that the U.S. is not involved in Israel's strikes on Iran, though Israel did tell the U.S. about the operation in advance, and the U.S. has helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.

      "Medicaid and provider taxes",
      "GOP senators have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031. The House bill seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "Several Republicans have said\u00a0the bill could lose their support if the provider tax were to be frozen or decreased, pointing to the potential negative impact on rural hospitals.

      "House Republicans from blue states threatened last month to withhold their support for the bill if the cap were not raised and quickly said Monday they'd vote against the package when it comes back to the House.

      "It was a similar sentiment shared by Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who said the figure was a \"just a placeholder.\"",

      "A federal jury in Colorado on Monday found that one of the nation's most prominent election conspiracy theorists, MyPillow founder\u00a0Mike Lindell, defamed a former employee of a leading voting equipment company after the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The employee, Eric Coomer, sued after Lindell called him a traitor and accusations about him stealing the election were streamed on Lindell's online media platform.",
      "Coomer was the security and product strategy director at Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose voting machines became the target of elaborate conspiracy theories among allies of President Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 was due to widespread fraud.",
      "Dominion won a $787 million settlement in a defamation lawsuit it filed against Fox News over its airing of false claims against the company and has another lawsuit against the conservative network Newsmax.",
      "Newsmax apologized to Coomer in 2021 for airing false allegations against him.",
      "Coomer said during the two-week Lindell trial that his career and life were destroyed by the statements. His lawyers said Lindell either knew the statements were lies, or conveyed them recklessly without knowing if they were true.",
      "Lindell's lawyers denied the claims and said his online platform, formerly known as Frankspeech, is not liable for statements made by others.",
      "Lindell said he went to trial to draw attention to the need to get rid of electronic voting machines that have been targeted in a web of conspiracy theories. He said he used to be worth about $60 million before he started speaking out about the 2020 election and is now $10 million in debt.",
      "Lindell recently used his defamation trial to boost sales of his pillows, linens and other products, as well as to raise money for his legal defense.",
      "On June 4, Lindell\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media that \"My employee-owned company and I are in jury trial NOW and need your support!\" He included a link to a landing page on his company's website that includes the line, \"Use promo code JURY\" to receive a \"free Multi-Use MyPillow 2.0\" with any purchase. The website also includes a link to the \"Mike Lindell Legal Defense Fund,\" which asks for donations of between $10 to $1,000. The fundraising effort notes that Lindell has spent \"nearly all his resources ... to exposing corruption in our election systems.\"",
      "Reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Mr. Trump contested his loss in 2020 all affirmed Democrat\u00a0Joe Biden's victory. Mr. Trump's\u00a0attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of widespread fraud, and Mr. Trump and his allies lost dozens of court cases\u00a0seeking to overturn the result.",
      "Lindell stuck by his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen during the trial, but did not call any experts to present evidence of his claims.",
      "Lindell said his beliefs that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud were influenced by watching the 2020 HBO documentary \"Kill Chain\" and by the views of Mr. Trump's former national security adviser,\u00a0Michael Flynn. In an interview for a documentary Lindell made in 2021, Flynn said foreign interference was going to happen in U.S. elections, and Lindell said he had no reason to doubt the claim since Flynn had worked for both political parties in intelligence.",
      "Lindell distanced himself from an account by a Colorado podcaster who claimed to have heard a conference call from the anti-fascist group Antifa before the 2020 election. The podcast claimed that on the call, someone named Eric from Dominion said he would make sure that Mr. Trump would not win, a story that was recounted on Frankspeech during a 2021 event. Lindell said he only learned about that during the trial.",
      "Lindell said he never accused Coomer of rigging the election, but he did say he was upset because he said Newsmax blocked him from being able to go on the air to talk about voting machines after it apologized to Coomer. Coomer denied there was any such deal to block Lindell under his agreement with the network.",
      "Coomer's lawyers tried to show how their client's life was devastated by the conspiracy theories spreading about him. Lindell was comparatively late to seize on Coomer, not mentioning him until February 2021, well after his name had been circulated by other Trump partisans.",
      "Coomer said the conspiracy theories cost him his job, his mental health and the life he'd built, and said Lindell's statements were the most distressing of all. He specifically pointed to a statement on May 9, 2021, when Lindell described what he believed Coomer had done as \"treason.\"",
      "Lindell's attorneys argued that Coomer's reputation was already in tatters by the time Lindell mentioned him. They said that was partly because of Coomer's own Facebook posts disparaging Mr. Trump, which the former Dominion employee acknowledged were \"hyperbolic\" and had been a mistake.",

    "summary": "The American Bar Association is accusing President Trump of using his \"vast powers\" to \"coerce lawyers and law firms.\"",
    "story": [
      "The American Bar Association sued the Trump administration Monday, arguing President Trump's wide-ranging push to punish law firms is unconstitutional. It joined\u00a0several targeted firms that have filed suit against the government.",
      "The lawsuit takes aim at a series of controversial orders signed by Mr. Trump that direct the government to cut off security clearances, contracts and even federal building access for some of the nation's largest law firms. The orders often fault the firms for taking on certain pro bono clients, associating with Mr. Trump's legal foes or engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion practices that the administration claims are discriminatory.",
      "The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues Mr. Trump has \"used the vast powers of the Executive Branch to coerce lawyers and law firms to abandon clients, causes, and policy positions the President does not like,\" in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields called the lawsuit \"clearly frivolous.\"",
      "\"The President has always had discretion over which contracts the government enters into and who receives security clearances. His exercise of these core executive functions cannot be dictated by the ABA, a private organization, or the courts. The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue,\" Fields wrote in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The bar association's lawsuit cites the deals struck by several law firms, which promised hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono work to causes favored by the administration in order to avoid future targeting by the government.",
      "It also argues the Trump administration's gambit has led to a \"chilling effect,\" intimidating some law firms into not taking pro bono cases that run counter to the Trump administration's agenda \u2014 especially in immigration-related matters.",
      "The American Bar Association said it has been a victim of this chilling effect. The organization, which counts hundreds of thousands of attorneys as members, wrote in the suit that it has had trouble finding law firms willing to represent it in pro bono cases.",
      "The group has tangled with the Trump administration in the past: The Justice Department has said it will not pay for its staff to attend ABA events and has taken aim at the ABA's diversity policies. The group sued the government earlier this year for cutting off some training grants, arguing it was being punished for protected speech, leading a judge to block the policy.",
      "The ABA alleged in Monday's suit that in a lawsuit over grant cutoffs, it \"was unable to obtain pro bono representation by any of the firms it contacted.\"",
      "The lawsuit asks a federal judge to declare that Mr. Trump's orders are unconstitutional and enjoin the administration from taking similar actions.",
      "\"Whoever wins the next election will be free to squelch dissent based on policy disagreements,\" the suit reads. \"There is no limiting principle: The next Administration might threaten adverse Executive Branch actions against any lawyer or law firm that dares to represent an oil company, or a gun manufacturer, or the Federalist Society or Fox News.\"",
      "Multiple law firms that were targeted by the Trump administration have sued over the orders, resulting in\u00a0 injunctions from federal judges\u00a0that sometimes lambasted\u00a0the administration. In one ruling that blocked the government from targeting Perkins Coie, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said Mr. Trump's order sent the message that \"lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.\"",
      "Several other firms have cut deals with the administration, promising to carry out mutually agreed-upon pro bono work. These deals are controversial within the legal community \u2014 and within the firms themselves \u2014 with opponents arguing the firms are capitulating to the government and may not be trustworthy. Supporters of the deals say the firms were put into an impossible position\u00a0and risked losing scores of clients and attorneys if they chose to take on the government.",

    "summary": "Dr. Fiona Havers' resignation follows RFK Jr.'s orders to change the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",
      "The committee's new membership is set to meet next week to vote on updated vaccine recommendations for COVID-19 and RSV, among other diseases.",

    "summary": "President Trump is meeting with world leaders outside Calgary in Canada for the G7 summit.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 At an economic summit of world leaders in Canada Monday, President Trump weighed in on the Israel-Iran conflict, telling reporters Iran would \"like to talk, but they should have done that before.\"",
      "He told reporters as he met with Group of Seven summit host Prime Minister Mark Carney that Iran has \"to make a deal.\" The president confirmed that he's seen messages from Iran, through intermediaries indicating a wish to deescalate.",
      "\"They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. On the 61st day, I said, 'we don't have a deal.' They have to make a deal, and it's painful for both parties. But I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately, before it's too late.\"",
      "Asked what it would take for the U.S. military to get involved in the Iran situation, the president said, \"I don't want to talk about that.\"",
      "The summit, just outside of Calgary, comes as tensions between Israel and Iran boil over, now in their fourth day of open conflict. A draft G7 statement on Iran has been floated, but Mr. Trump does not plan to sign the statement, U.S. officials said. One U.S. official said Mr. Trump will continue to work toward ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. The draft statement discusses monitoring Iran, calls for both sides to protect civilians, and re-ups commitments to peace, according to the officials.",
      "The meeting of world leaders is taking place as Mr. Trump's aides and top U.S. officials negotiate with these same allies over\u00a0tariffs he's imposed. First up on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was the meeting with Carney, whom Mr. Trump met last month at the White House. The summit will continue into Tuesday.",
      "\"The G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership, and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States,\" Carney told Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We've developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"I'm a tariff person. I've always been a tariff person,\" the president said alongside Carney.",
      "After meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Mr. Trump held up what he said was a trade agreement he said he and Starmer had just signed. Starmer said the document implements an agreement on car and aerospace tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump also held a private, one-on-one meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward some U.S. allies as well as the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he's launched throughout the world has made some of the U.S. relationships more tense and has been an undercurrent of the conversations Mr. Trump has on Monday. Mr. Trump's musings to\u00a0acquire Canada and Greenland\u00a0have also strained the United States' relationship with Canada.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he'd consider allowing China to join the group of world leaders and brought up Russian President Vladimir Putin's ouster from the group in 2014 after he invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.",
      "\"Putin speaks to me, he doesn't speak to anybody else,\" Mr. Trump said, as he stood next to Carney, who appeared to purse his lips and look away periodically as Mr. Trump spoke about Putin. \"He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8. As I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. It was very insulting.\"",
      "Carney told reporters his meeting with Mr. Trump was \"fantastic.\"",
      "\"We will have open, frank discussions over the course of two days,\" Carney said in the first session with all seven leaders present. \"We might not agree on absolutely every issue. But where we will cooperate, we will make an enormous difference for citizens and for the world, and bring the next era of prosperity, I hope, to the benefit of those we serve.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with Carney at the White House, the newly elected prime minister made it clear that Canada \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump's public musings \u2014 is not for sale.",
      "\"As a real estate developer, you know, I'm a real estate developer at heart,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"When you get rid of that artificially drawn line ... when you look at that beautiful formation when it's together, I'm a very artistic person.\"",
      "Carney interjected, using language he believed Mr. Trump as a real estate developer would understand.",
      "\"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" Carney said. \"We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.\"",

      "Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote in a June 5 resignation letter to DNC Chair Ken Martin that she felt \"out of step with the leadership you are forging.\"",
      "\"I do not want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent and actively trying to engage more and more of our communities,\" Weingarten wrote in the letter, obtained by CBS News.",
      "Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), declined his nomination as a member of the DNC weeks ago in a letter to Martin, his union confirmed. Saunders said his decision was about the future for working people and the party.",
      "\"These are new times. They demand new strategies, new thinking, and a renewed way of fighting for the values we hold dear. We must evolve to meet the urgency of this moment. This is not a time to close ranks or turn inward,\" Saunders said in a statement.",
      "Their two unions represent a combined membership of just over 3 million.",
      "Their departures come after a different internal controversy was settled on activist David Hogg, whose election as a party vice chair was voided by a committee vote in June. Hogg decided he would exit his role rather than run in a redo of the DNC vice chair elections.",
      "The vote to hold new vice chair elections came amid internal disagreements over Hogg's plans to back primary challenges against incumbent Democrats, though the challenge that led to the new contests was technically unrelated to Hogg's controversies.",
      "Weingarten had been a DNC member since 2002, and a member of the Rules and Bylaws committee since 2009, but Martin took both her and Saunders off that committee and offered to let them remain as at-large members of the party. Both declined their nominations.",
      "Both Saunders and Weingarten supported Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, and not Martin, in this year's election for a new DNC chair. News of Saunders' and Weingarten's departures was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A source close to the DNC, who was granted anonymity to talk about an internal issue, said that ever since \"the horse [Weingarten] bet on in the Chairs race lost, she has always been on the other side of the fence as Ken\u2013 this is no surprise.\"",
      "In reaction to the departure of the two labor union leaders, DNC Labor Council Chair Stuart Applebaum defended Martin and said he understands \"that workers are the backbone of the Democratic party.\"",

      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a nearby suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer, and, according to the FBI, also\u00a0traveled to the residences of two other Minnesota state legislators on the night of the shootings but did not go inside. One of those legislators wasn't at home, and a police officer approached the suspect on the property of another, which prompted him to leave.",
      "The\u00a0suspect\u00a0in the Minnesota shootings, identified as\u00a057-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was taken into custody\u00a0Sunday night following a two-day manhunt. Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing first-degree murder charges for the killings of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",
      "Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Nine bullets hit Sen. Hoffman and eight struck his wife, Yvette, and they were both \"lucky to be alive,\" Yvette Hoffman told Sen. Amy Klobuchar in a text message on Sunday.",
      "\"Our family is so humbled by the love and outpouring we've received from everyone. John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote, in part. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "After authorities learned of the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home, Police Chief Mark Bruley said. The two homes are about five miles apart.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a man dressed as a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the man, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he did not survive. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask concealing his full head and face.",
      "A search of the man's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in the vehicle \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers referenced the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, all \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Suspect Vance L. Boelter in custody",
      "The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Boelter faces state and federal charges. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office in Minnesota filed charges Saturday for second-degree murder and attempted murder in order to obtain a nationwide search warrant, which were the highest charges the office could file at that time, said Mary Frances Moriarty, the county attorney. However, Moriarty told reporters at a news conference Monday that the office intends to seek first-degree murder charges, which would carry a penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole if Boelter is convicted.",
      "Federal authorities have also brought charges against Boelter, including two counts each of stalking, murder and shooting the Hortmans and Hoffmans.",
      "Investigators had been searching the Sibley County area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",

In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",

Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said there was \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",

      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Before Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, is a Democrat who represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",

    "summary": "The move marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.",
      "The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "The scaling back of some ICE operations reflects increased concern among industry leaders that the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide immigration crackdown was hindering their businesses and the broader U.S. economy by spooking their workforce.",
      "It also marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status, regardless of whether they have criminal histories. And it comes amid a vast expansion in immigration arrests across the U.S. that has triggered protests against ICE activity in major American cities, including Los Angeles, where President Trump has deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines in response to instances of violence.",
      "Asked about the catalyst for the sudden decision to limit ICE enforcement, one of the sources said the president was not aware of the scale of the agency's operations.",
      "\"Once it hit him, he pulled it back,\" the source said.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to preview the policy change during a White House event earlier in the week, describing an upcoming \"order\" to protect farms and hotels relying on immigrant workers.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're gonna have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the move.",
      "Mr. Trump came into office in January promising to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. His administration quickly reversed limits on ICE operations put in place by previous administrations and moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants, greatly expanding the pool of those at risk of being arrested and deported.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE arrests have increased sharply, with the agency adopting more aggressive tactics, including efforts to arrest migrants and asylum-seekers attending their court hearings and check-in appointments.",
      "So far in June, ICE has averaged more than 1,300 arrests each day, a more than 100% increase from President Trump's first 100 days in office, when the agency recorded a 660 daily arrest rate, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. On Saturday, ICE was holding more than 56,000 individuals in detention facilities throughout the country, a record high, the figures show.",
      "While ICE operations have expanded recently, the arrests recorded by the agency remain well below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Jun 2025 05:00:09 -0400",
    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an internal memo obtained by CBS News, the Justice Department ordered its 93 federal prosecutors' offices to beef up preparations for criminal cases stemming from unrest in communities across the country over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",
      "David Huerta, a longtime union leader, is charged in Los Angeles with conspiracy. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 7. According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9. Prosecutors alleged McIver sought to stop federal agents from arresting the mayor of Newark during the confrontation. \"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Justice Department said. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

    "story": [
      "The American Bar Association sued the Trump administration Monday, arguing President Trump's wide-ranging push to punish law firms is unconstitutional. It joined\u00a0several targeted firms that have filed suit against the government.",
      "The lawsuit takes aim at a series of controversial orders signed by Mr. Trump that direct the government to cut off security clearances, contracts and even federal building access for some of the nation's largest law firms. The orders often fault the firms for taking on certain pro bono clients, associating with Mr. Trump's legal foes or engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion practices that the administration claims are discriminatory.",
      "The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues Mr. Trump has \"used the vast powers of the Executive Branch to coerce lawyers and law firms to abandon clients, causes, and policy positions the President does not like,\" in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields called the lawsuit \"clearly frivolous.\"",
      "\"The President has always had discretion over which contracts the government enters into and who receives security clearances. His exercise of these core executive functions cannot be dictated by the ABA, a private organization, or the courts. The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue,\" Fields wrote in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The bar association's lawsuit cites the deals struck by several law firms, which promised hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono work to causes favored by the administration in order to avoid future targeting by the government.",
      "It also argues the Trump administration's gambit has led to a \"chilling effect,\" intimidating some law firms into not taking pro bono cases that run counter to the Trump administration's agenda \u2014 especially in immigration-related matters.",
      "The American Bar Association said it has been a victim of this chilling effect. The organization, which counts hundreds of thousands of attorneys as members, wrote in the suit that it has had trouble finding law firms willing to represent it in pro bono cases.",
      "The group has tangled with the Trump administration in the past: The Justice Department has said it will not pay for its staff to attend ABA events and has taken aim at the ABA's diversity policies. The group sued the government earlier this year for cutting off some training grants, arguing it was being punished for protected speech, leading a judge to block the policy.",
      "The ABA alleged in Monday's suit that in a lawsuit over grant cutoffs, it \"was unable to obtain pro bono representation by any of the firms it contacted.\"",
      "The lawsuit asks a federal judge to declare that Mr. Trump's orders are unconstitutional and enjoin the administration from taking similar actions.",
      "\"Whoever wins the next election will be free to squelch dissent based on policy disagreements,\" the suit reads. \"There is no limiting principle: The next Administration might threaten adverse Executive Branch actions against any lawyer or law firm that dares to represent an oil company, or a gun manufacturer, or the Federalist Society or Fox News.\"",
      "Multiple law firms that were targeted by the Trump administration have sued over the orders, resulting in\u00a0 injunctions from federal judges\u00a0that sometimes lambasted\u00a0the administration. In one ruling that blocked the government from targeting Perkins Coie, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said Mr. Trump's order sent the message that \"lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.\"",
      "Several other firms have cut deals with the administration, promising to carry out mutually agreed-upon pro bono work. These deals are controversial within the legal community \u2014 and within the firms themselves \u2014 with opponents arguing the firms are capitulating to the government and may not be trustworthy. Supporters of the deals say the firms were put into an impossible position\u00a0and risked losing scores of clients and attorneys if they chose to take on the government.",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",

One U.S. official said Mr. Trump will continue to work toward ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. The draft statement discusses monitoring Iran, calls for both sides to protect civilians, and re-ups commitments to peace, according to the officials.",
      "The meeting of world leaders is taking place as Mr. Trump's aides and top U.S. officials negotiate with these same allies over\u00a0tariffs he's imposed. First up on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was the meeting with Carney, whom Mr. Trump met last month at the White House. The summit will continue into Tuesday.",
      "\"The G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership, and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States,\" Carney told Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We've developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"I'm a tariff person. I've always been a tariff person,\" the president said alongside Carney.",
      "After meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Mr. Trump held up what he said was a trade agreement he said he and Starmer had just signed. Starmer said the document implements an agreement on car and aerospace tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump also held a private, one-on-one meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward some U.S. allies as well as the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he's launched throughout the world has made some of the U.S. relationships more tense and has been an undercurrent of the conversations Mr. Trump has on Monday. Mr. Trump's musings to\u00a0acquire Canada and Greenland\u00a0have also strained the United States' relationship with Canada.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he'd consider allowing China to join the group of world leaders and brought up Russian President Vladimir Putin's ouster from the group in 2014 after he invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.",
      "\"Putin speaks to me, he doesn't speak to anybody else,\" Mr. Trump said, as he stood next to Carney, who appeared to purse his lips and look away periodically as Mr. Trump spoke about Putin. \"He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8. As I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. It was very insulting.\"",
      "Carney told reporters his meeting with Mr. Trump was \"fantastic.\"",
      "\"We will have open, frank discussions over the course of two days,\" Carney said in the first session with all seven leaders present. \"We might not agree on absolutely every issue. But where we will cooperate, we will make an enormous difference for citizens and for the world, and bring the next era of prosperity, I hope, to the benefit of those we serve.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with Carney at the White House, the newly elected prime minister made it clear that Canada \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump's public musings \u2014 is not for sale.",
      "\"As a real estate developer, you know, I'm a real estate developer at heart,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"When you get rid of that artificially drawn line ... when you look at that beautiful formation when it's together, I'm a very artistic person.\"",
      "Carney interjected, using language he believed Mr. Trump as a real estate developer would understand.",
      "\"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" Carney said. \"We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.\"",

      "Flash flooding caused by torrential rains killed at least six people, including a 3-year-old child, in northern West Virginia and rescue crews were still searching for several missing people, officials said. Authorities were assessing damage to roads, bridges, natural gas lines and other infrastructure.",
      "Officials said 2.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about half an hour on Saturday night. The unexpected deluge overwhelmed local waterways and infrastructure and submerged vehicles in small towns east of the Ohio River, including in Triadelphia and Valley Grove,\u00a0CBS affiliate WTRF reported.",
      "In Fairmont, a city nearly 100 miles from Wheeling, severe flooding led to multiple water rescues Sunday afternoon,\u00a0CBS affiliate WDTV reported, including at an apartment building in Marion County.",
      "A city spokesperson told CBS News that an apartment building had partially collapsed, but it wasn't immediately clear how many people were impacted. Residents were evacuated to Fairmont State University's campus, the spokesperson said.",
      "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Monday that the death toll had risen to six, with two still missing. The governor said at an earlier news conference that he's working closely with authorities from FEMA.",
      "Authorities said vehicles were swept into swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire. First responders successfully completed 19 swift water rescues, Morrisey said.",
      "\"It happened so quickly\"",
      "\"We almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\" Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \"During this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways, where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents. So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \"It happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I've been doing this for 35 years. I've seen major floods here in the city and the county. I've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling in the state's northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday's early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\"We're searching the banks, we're searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\" Blazier said. \"We're using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we're trying to recover anybody that's missing.\"",
      "There were about 2,500 power outages in the county as of Sunday afternoon, the governor said. Restoration efforts were hampered by natural gas leaks that have to be fixed first, officials said.",
      "\"Please \u2014 stay off the roads,\" Gov. Morrisey warned residents. \"Do not underestimate the strength and speed of these floods. Pray for our friends and neighbors during this challenging time for our state.\"",

      "\"Please keep this community in your prayers,\" Morrisey said in a statement Sunday. \"More storms are expected in the region today. Please follow all directives from local and state emergency management officials and do not attempt to drive through flooded roads.\"",
      "The West Virginia rains followed heavy downpours in San Antonio on Thursday that\u00a0killed 13 people. More than 7 inches of rain fell over several hours in the Texas city, causing fast-rising floodwaters to carry more than a dozen cars into a creek.",

    "story": [
      "A suspect in custody has been charged with murder following targeted shootings\u00a0that killed one Minnesota lawmaker and injured another. Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings \"politically motivated\" in a news briefing\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a nearby suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer, and, according to the FBI, also\u00a0traveled to the residences of two other Minnesota state legislators on the night of the shootings but did not go inside. One of those legislators wasn't at home, and a police officer approached the suspect on the property of another, which prompted him to leave.",
      "The\u00a0suspect\u00a0in the Minnesota shootings, identified as\u00a057-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was taken into custody\u00a0Sunday night following a two-day manhunt. Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing first-degree murder charges for the killings of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",
      "Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Nine bullets hit Sen. Hoffman and eight struck his wife, Yvette, and they were both \"lucky to be alive,\" Yvette Hoffman told Sen. Amy Klobuchar in a text message on Sunday.",
      "\"Our family is so humbled by the love and outpouring we've received from everyone. John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote, in part. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "After authorities learned of the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home, Police Chief Mark Bruley said. The two homes are about five miles apart.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a man dressed as a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the man, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he did not survive. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask concealing his full head and face.",
      "A search of the man's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in the vehicle \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers referenced the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, all \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Suspect Vance L. Boelter in custody",
      "The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Boelter faces state and federal charges. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office in Minnesota filed charges Saturday for second-degree murder and attempted murder in order to obtain a nationwide search warrant, which were the highest charges the office could file at that time, said Mary Frances Moriarty, the county attorney. However, Moriarty told reporters at a news conference Monday that the office intends to seek first-degree murder charges, which would carry a penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole if Boelter is convicted.",
      "Federal authorities have also brought charges against Boelter, including two counts each of stalking, murder and shooting the Hortmans and Hoffmans.",
      "Investigators had been searching the Sibley County area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",
      "He was armed at the time, but Boelter was taken into custody without any use of force, Geiger said.",
      "Police said it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "The face of evil. After relentless and determined police work, the killer is now in custody. Thanks to the dedication of...",
      "Earlier Sunday, an emergency alert sent to residents of Sibley County said authorities found a vehicle belonging to the suspect in Faxon Township, which is roughly 20 miles away, CBS Minnesota reported. Although Boelter's known address is the home in the Sibley County town of Green Isle, a law enforcement source told CBS Minnesota that the suspect had most recently been living at a home in north Minneapolis.",
      "Suspect's work history",
      "Boelter is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. However, Boelter's roommate told CBS News that, while it was the suspect's \"dream\" to have his own security company, he did not actually have one.",
      "\"It seems he bought the two cars for the security company, but he had no clients and he had no business,\" the roommate told CBS News. \"He had no employees and wasn't doing any security for anyone.\"",
      "In a\u00a0profile\u00a0on the website of Minnesota Africans United, which is no longer active, he is also described as the company's CEO.",
      "In a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0post last month, Boelter said he was \"looking to get back into the U.S. Food Industry\" after spending three years on projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a company where he has been listed as chief executive since 2021. In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",
      "Suspect served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman",
      "Boelter served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman, records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "Boelter was first appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board in 2016 by then-Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said there was \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",
      "\"I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, Mark, have two children.",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Before Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, is a Democrat who represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "John Hoffman got out of his final surgery and was \"moving toward recovery\" Sunday night, Walz said.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter. The Hoffmans' nephew said Yvette Hoffman jumped on their daughter, Hope, to\u00a0shield her\u00a0from the gunfire.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting.\" He said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",

      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check.

      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",

    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "The internal directive comes amid intensifying waves of\u00a0assaults\u00a0by Israel and Iran, whose capital city of Tehran was bombarded on Sunday as the fighting began entering a fourth day. More than 220 Iranians and at least 14 Israelis have been killed in the clashes since they began, according to local authorities.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the United States \"is a partner in these attacks and must take responsibility.\"",
      "In a\u00a0security alert\u00a0issued Sunday, the U.S. State Department announced that its embassies and consulates in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv would remain closed on Monday, in compliance with Israel Home Front Command Guidance. It urged all U.S. government employees and their family members to continue sheltering in place until further notice.",
      "Asked as he was departing Washington, D.C., for the Group of 7, or G7, Summit in Canada how the U.S. was working to de-escalate the conflict, President Trump told reporters on Sunday, \"I think it's time for a deal, and we'll see what happens.\"",
      "He said the U.S. would continue to support Israel in its defense, with American officials confirming military forces have been operating by land, sea and air to intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "In an earlier social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said if U.S. interests were attacked by Iran, \"the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's statements came as previously announced nuclear talks between the United States and Iran were called off. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff had been slated to travel to Oman on Sunday for a sixth round of direct and indirect negotiations. Iran told mediators in Qatar and Oman it would not negotiate \"while under attack,\" a source with knowledge of the communication told CBS News.",

    "summary": "J.J. Spaun took advantage of a lengthy rain delay to recover and win the U.S. Open.",
    "story": [
      "J.J. Spaun turned a sloppy mess of a U.S. Open at wet and nasty Oakmont into a thing of beauty at the end Sunday with two stunning shots that carried him to his first major championship.",
      "First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green\u00a0for a birdie that gave him the lead. Needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished his storybook Open by\u00a0holing the longest putt all week at Oakmont\u00a0for birdie and a 2-over 72.",
      "That made him the only player to finish under par at 1-under 279. It gave him a two-shot victory over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland.",
      "And it made Spaun, the 36-year-old Californian who resembles the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris, a major champion in only his second U.S. Open.",
      "\"I never thought I would be here holding this trophy,\" said Spaun, who finished last year at No. 119 in the world with only one PGA Tour title in his career. \"I always had aspirations and dreams. I never knew what my ceiling was. I'm just trying to be the best golfer I can be.\"",
      "It was calamity for so many others.",
      "Sam Burns had a two-shot lead going to the 11th tee, made a double bogey from a divot in the first cut and from a lie in the fairway so wet he thought he deserved relief. He shot 78.",
      "Adam Scott, trying to become the first player to go more than 11 years between major titles, was tied for the lead with five holes to play. One of the best drivers could no longer find the fairway. He played them in 5 over and shot 79.",
      "\"I missed the fairway. I hadn't done that all week really. Then I did, and I paid the price and lost a lot of shots out there,\" Scott said.",
      "Carlos Ortiz and Tyrrell Hatton also slashed away in slushy lies, all making mistakes that cost them a chance to survive this beast of day.",
      "The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun.",
      "One shot behind at the start of the day, he opened with five bogeys in six holes with some horrific breaks, none worse than hitting the pin on the second hole and seeing it spin back to the fairway. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes.",
      "\"The weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,\" Spaun said.",
      "Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way.",
      "But oh, that finish.",
      "MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead.",
      "Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup.",
      "And then the final putt \u2014 no one made a longer one all week. He was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it drop as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted.",
      "He raised both arms and tossed his putter, jumping into the arms of caddie Mark Carens.",
      "The celebration carried into those who lost the battle.",
      "MacIntyre, so close to becoming Scotland's first major champion since Paul Lawrie in 1999,\u00a0sat in scoring in front of a TV and applauded.",
      "Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood.",
      "\"Unbelievable. What a putt to win. That's incredible,\" he said. \"I'm sad about how I finished, but I'm very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing.\"",
      "Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all \u2014 the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start.",
      "\"After his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,\" Hovland said. \"Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn't expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast.\"",
      "Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine. But he missed far too many birdie chances even three-putting from 12 feet on the 11th hole. The world's No. 1 player finished with a 70 to tie for seventh with Jon Rahm (67) and Burns, his best friend who will feel the sting.",
      "He had a double bogey by missing the green into a bad lie on the slope of a bunker. He missed a pair of 6-foot birdie putts to seize control. And when he made a mess of the 15th for another double bogey.",
      "Through it all, Spaun emerged as a U.S. Open champion hardly anyone saw coming \u2014 not at the start of the year, not at the start of the round.",

      "Organizers of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. Confrontations were isolated.",
      "But one person was transported to a Salt Lake City hospital Saturday night with life-threatening injuries after a shooting during that city's protest, officials said. Salt Lake City police said the shooting was \"possibly associated with the demonstration.\"",
      "Huge, boisterous crowds marched in New York, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, some behind \"no kings\" banners.",
      "Thousands of protesters across L.A. \u2014 where demonstrations have occurred in the past week over immigration raids \u2014 were largely peaceful throughout the day, but police issued a dispersal order near the city's downtown federal building after the crowd allegedly started throwing objects at officers.",
      "Police deployed smoke and ordered everyone to leave the area at roughly 3:55 p.m. local time. Aerial footage shows officers detaining several people, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "The gatherings were timed for the same day Mr. Trump will be attending a\u00a0military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, and amid heightened tensions with National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests there.",
      "Saturday morning, Minnesota officials canceled all of the state's \"No Kings\" protests after\u00a0Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0and her husband were killed and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings targeting the Democratic lawmakers overnight. Police said they found \"No Kings\" fliers and a list of other potential targets in the suspect's vehicle.",
      "In Texas, state legislators received a \"credible threat\" against them ahead of the planned protest at the state capitol building in Austin, the state's Department of Public Safety said. A suspect was later arrested.",
      "In other cities around the country, protests began as scheduled.",
      "Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol.",
      "Light rain fell as marchers gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia. They shouted \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" as they marched to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they listened to speakers on the steps made famous in the movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"So what do you say, Philly?\" Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \"Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\"",
      "An estimated tens of thousands joined the \"No Kings\" demonstrations throughout Portland, Oregon, according to Portland police, but hours later, the city's police\u00a0declared a riot for several hours during a protest outside the ICE building. Portland police said in a release early Sunday that three people were arrested near the ICE facility for \"criminal actions, and not constitutionally protected free speech.\"",
      "The demonstrations come on the heels of protests flaring up around the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that ramped up last week, with Mr. Trump ordering National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles as some protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.",
      "Democratic governors called Mr. Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",
      "Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.",
      "\"New Yorkers may have different emotions right now,\" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a briefing on Friday. \"And they have a right to express that, \u00a0but we want to be clear you do not have a right to engage in violence and lawlessness.\"",
      "New York City expected hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to turn out, with multiple protests planned around the area, organizers said.",
      "Though no major demonstration was expected in Washington, D.C., where the\u00a0military parade\u00a0will take place on what is also Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, some protesters gathered Saturday in Lafayette Square, across from the White House.",
      "What is No Kings Day?",
      "The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the\u00a050501 Movement, to support democracy and against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.",
      "Protesters have called for Mr. Trump to be \"dethroned\" as they compare his actions to those of a king and not a democratically elected president.",
      "According to a statement by the organizers, the No Kings Day of Defiance is intended to reject authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics and the militarization of the country's democracy.",
      "The event was promoted by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, herself a billionaire, in a full-page advertisement she took out in The New York Times last Sunday. No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",
      "Organizers timed the protests to counter the Army's 250th anniversary celebration, which included a military parade involving hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers. The parade has been estimated to cost between $25 million to $45 million, The Army expected the parade to attract as many as 200,000 people.",
      "\"The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,\" the \"No Kings\" website says. \"On June 14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't \u2014 to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\"",

      "Nebraska's governor on Friday also signed an emergency proclamation for activating his state's National Guard, a step his office called \"a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.\"",
      "Organizers say that one march would go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the \"line is very clear\" and not to cross it. Another demonstration is set for Fort Lauderdale. Organizers told CBS News Miami they had hundreds of people registered for the event.",

      "One community that's especially vulnerable, experts say, are victims of domestic violence. Crystal Justice, chief external affairs officer at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, told CBS News in a statement that they have seen abusive partners \"threatening to deport a partner or their family or withholding legal documents to limit a person's ability to travel.\"",
      "Many immigrants are in the U.S. on a visa supported by a U.S. citizen, or are undocumented, with few protections. Often, as the relationship spirals into abuse allegations, spurned or angered partners can threaten to deport their loved ones with uncertain immigration statuses.",
      "Esther Limb, immigration practice director at Her Justice in New York City, a not-for-profit that advises and trains attorneys to provide free legal help to women, said there has been a rise in the threats of deportations by abusers.",
      "\"While using immigration status against their victims is a common tactic used by many abusers, by echoing the anti-immigrant rhetoric and pointing to immigration enforcements happening in their communities, the threat of deportation by abusive spouses is louder than ever and allows abusers to wield greater power and control over their victims,\" Limb said.",
      "A massive backlog and long waits",
      "Limb represents numerous clients \u2014 including the one interviewed for this CBS News piece \u2014 in filing petitions to stay in the U.S. after alleging domestic violence. Waiting for an answer to these petitions can take years due to backlogs and vetting for the applications.",

    "summary": "The CDC's new \"checklist\" comes amid a deadly year of measles outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

      "Merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers in a move to cash in on two coinciding events: the Army's 250th anniversary parade and the \"No Kings\" protests against the Trump administration.",
      "For the Army's 250th anniversary, hundreds of items appeared for sale on Amazon and Etsy including T-shirts, hats, mugs and more. One T-shirt for sale on Amazon and Etsy, for example, reads \"250 Years Defending Liberty\" with the U.S. flag, while another commemorates \"250 Years of Service\" with the message, \"Freedom Isn't Free.\"",
      "On China-based Temu.com, a seller shipping goods from a U.S.-based warehouse offers a T-shirt reading \"No Kings in America\" and featuring the Statue of Liberty and American flag for $5.20. On Amazon, a search for \"No Kings\" yielded 1,000 results.",
      "Much of the merchandise available on the e-commerce giant's site is printed on demand, meaning not in stock. Sellers print T-shirts or make the goods as soon as they are ordered to avoid sitting on unwanted inventory.",
      "Walmart, which has distanced itself from an ad promoting No Kings that was funded by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, offers a more limited amount of merchandise related to the events on its website.",
      "It's common for sellers to quickly mock up merchandise tied to current events. For example, retailers were quick to start selling apparel featuring images of President Trump with a bloodied ear after he was shot at a rally last year in an assassination attempt.",
      "The No Kings protests were scheduled to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary. The day was also President Trump's 79th birthday.",

For new first-time moms, average age also increased, from 26.6 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2023.

      "Washington \u2014 In an internal memo obtained by CBS News, the Justice Department ordered its 93 federal prosecutors' offices to beef up preparations for criminal cases stemming from unrest in communities across the country over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",
      "David Huerta, a longtime union leader, is charged in Los Angeles with conspiracy. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 7. According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9.

      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",
      "For more information on how to safely use Venmo, the company's\u00a0website\u00a0outlines common mobile payment scams and how to avoid them.",
      "Can everyone see my Venmo payment history?",
      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

    "summary": "President Trump is meeting with world leaders outside Calgary in Canada for the G7 summit.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 At an economic summit of world leaders in Canada Monday, President Trump weighed in on the Israel-Iran conflict, telling reporters Iran would \"like to talk, but they should have done that before.\"",
      "He told reporters as he met with Group of Seven summit host Prime Minister Mark Carney that Iran has \"to make a deal.\" The president confirmed that he's seen messages from Iran, through intermediaries indicating a wish to deescalate.",
      "\"They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. On the 61st day, I said, 'we don't have a deal.' They have to make a deal, and it's painful for both parties. But I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately, before it's too late.\"",
      "Asked what it would take for the U.S. military to get involved in the Iran situation, the president said, \"I don't want to talk about that.\"",
      "The summit, just outside of Calgary, comes as tensions between Israel and Iran boil over, now in their fourth day of open conflict. A draft G7 statement on Iran has been floated, but Mr. Trump does not plan to sign the statement, U.S. officials said. One U.S. official said Mr. Trump will continue to work toward ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. The draft statement discusses monitoring Iran, calls for both sides to protect civilians, and re-ups commitments to peace, according to the officials.",
      "The meeting of world leaders is taking place as Mr. Trump's aides and top U.S. officials negotiate with these same allies over\u00a0tariffs he's imposed. First up on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was the meeting with Carney, whom Mr. Trump met last month at the White House. The summit will continue into Tuesday.",
      "\"The G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership, and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States,\" Carney told Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We've developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"I'm a tariff person. I've always been a tariff person,\" the president said alongside Carney.",
      "After meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Mr. Trump held up what he said was a trade agreement he said he and Starmer had just signed. Starmer said the document implements an agreement on car and aerospace tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump also held a private, one-on-one meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward some U.S. allies as well as the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he's launched throughout the world has made some of the U.S. relationships more tense and has been an undercurrent of the conversations Mr. Trump has on Monday. Mr. Trump's musings to\u00a0acquire Canada and Greenland\u00a0have also strained the United States' relationship with Canada.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he'd consider allowing China to join the group of world leaders and brought up Russian President Vladimir Putin's ouster from the group in 2014 after he invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.",
      "\"Putin speaks to me, he doesn't speak to anybody else,\" Mr. Trump said, as he stood next to Carney, who appeared to purse his lips and look away periodically as Mr. Trump spoke about Putin. \"He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8. As I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. It was very insulting.\"",
      "Carney told reporters his meeting with Mr. Trump was \"fantastic.\"",
      "\"We will have open, frank discussions over the course of two days,\" Carney said in the first session with all seven leaders present. \"We might not agree on absolutely every issue. But where we will cooperate, we will make an enormous difference for citizens and for the world, and bring the next era of prosperity, I hope, to the benefit of those we serve.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with Carney at the White House, the newly elected prime minister made it clear that Canada \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump's public musings \u2014 is not for sale.",
      "\"As a real estate developer, you know, I'm a real estate developer at heart,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"When you get rid of that artificially drawn line ... when you look at that beautiful formation when it's together, I'm a very artistic person.\"",
      "Carney interjected, using language he believed Mr. Trump as a real estate developer would understand.",
      "\"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" Carney said. \"We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.\"",

      "\"The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) have been located and secured,\" an official from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said in a statement late on Sunday.",
      "The hope is that the voice recorder will help investigators piece together what caused the plane to crash just minutes after it took off from Ahmedabad Airport. The cockpit voice recorder captures audio from the cockpit, including conversations between pilots, alarms and ambient sounds.",
      "A mayday call was sent by the flight captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, seconds after the London-bound plane left the runway in Ahmedabad.",
      "Rescue workers and investigators recovered the other black box, the flight data recorder, on Friday. That recorder logs reams of data from the various systems on modern passenger jets, everything from altitude and speed to engine performance. Black boxes are designed to survive crashes and are considered vital to air accident investigators in determining the cause of disasters.",
      "India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the probe into the Thursday crash of flight 171. They are being assisted by teams from the U.S. and the U.K. A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board surveyed the crash site in Ahmedabad on Sunday. The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that representatives from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had also surveyed the crash site.",
      "\"The AAIB has launched a detailed investigation, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols since the aircraft is American-made,\" Prime Minister Modi's office said in a statement on Sunday.",
      "India's government also established a high-level committee specifically to investigate the crash and to recommend any changes deemed necessary to standard operating procedures going forward. That committee held its first meeting Monday.",
      "At least 33 people were killed on the ground as the Air India plane crashed into a building that housed students from a medical college next door.",
      "As the investigations into one of the worst accidents in India's aviation history continued, the families of hundreds of victims were still waiting to have their loved ones' remains returned to them.",
      "The plane went up in a massive ball of flames and much of the fuselage was reduced to rubble, making it difficult for authorities to retrieve and identify bodies. Officials have been working to match DNA samples from crash victims' remains and family members since late last week.",
      "CBS News saw several families of victims at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. The remains of at least 24 people had been handed over to their families as of Monday, authorities said.",
      "\"It's a long process and it will take its own time,\" Ahmedabad Police Commissioner G S Malik told CBS News on Monday. He said the final death toll would only be confirmed after all DNA testing was complete.",
      "\"Over 400 family members have reached Ahmedabad and are being assisted by our teams on the ground,\" Air India said in a statement on Sunday.",

    "summary": "Residents in Barcelona, Spain, and several other popular European destinations say tourism in their cities is driving up housing costs for locals.",
    "story": [
      "Residents in Spain and several other popular destinations in Europe protested against mass tourism Sunday, saying a flood of summer visitors is driving up housing costs in their cities and pushing out locals.",
      "Some of the protesters in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns.",
      "The protests were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\"The squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\" Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \"Barcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\"",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \"bubble tea\" spots.",
      "\"Our lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\"",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \"Everywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\" The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination's historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \"One more tourist, one less resident.\" They stuck stickers saying \"Citizen Self-Defense,\" in Catalan, and \"Tourist Go Home,\" in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel's doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona's main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but Wanda said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit weather.",
      "\"That's lovely, thank you sweetheart,\" she said to the squirter. \"I am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\"",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed a record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain's capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \"Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain's Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \"cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\" which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \"Your Airbnb was my home.\"",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\"I think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\" Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago, recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\"In the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\" he said.",
      "In another strategy, last year, Barcelona's leaders launched a program to replace outdated infrastructure in public schools to address rising temperatures, paid for by a tax on tourists.",
      "\"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News at the time.",
      "But some residents say the program misses the point.",
      "\"The government should be doing this without depending on tourism \u2026 it's public health,\" activist Agnes Rodriguez said. \"If you're coming to Barcelona tonight, to Chicago or to New York, and you're staying in a tourist apartment where a family should be living, you are part of this city changing. You're affecting the life of people living there.\"",

      "The decision added drama to the major aerospace industry event, which was already under the shadow of last week's deadly crash of Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.",

      "French official says Israeli \"offensive weapons\" barred amid war in Gaza",
      "French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision during a Monday press conference at the air show.",
      "\"The French government's position was very simple: no offensive weapons at the arms exposition,\" he said. \"Defensive weapons were perfectly acceptable.\"",
      "Bayrou cited the ongoing conflict in Gaza as the rationale behind the ban.",
      "\"Given France's diplomatic choices, in particular the concern, or in any case, very great worries about Gaza, we could not not show that there was a certain distance, which meant that we did not think it acceptable that offensive weapons were in a show like that,\" said Bayrou. \"And as these offensive weapons were not withdrawn [by the Israeli companies], we have temporarily, I hope, closed the stands.\"",
      "At the last Paris Air Show in 2023, Israeli companies - including at least one that was subject to the closure of its stall on Monday - appear to have displayed offensive weapons, including laser-guided bombs and rockets and attack drones.",
      "Aviation news outlet Flight Global reported from the show on Monday that, despite Bayrou's description of a ban on displays of offensive weapons, \"manufacturers from other countries are freely displaying a range of combat aircraft and munitions,\" which it included a display by the French-owned company Dassault Aviation featuring a \"French air force Rafale fighter surrounded by a range of strike munitions.\"",

      "The presence of Israeli firms at Le Bourget, though smaller than in the past, was already a source of tension before the start of the Paris Air Show, because of the conflict in Gaza.",
      "A French court last week rejected a bid by NGOs to ban Israeli companies from Le Bourget over concerns about \"international crimes.\"",
      "Local lawmakers from the Seine-Saint-Denis department hosting the event were absent during Bayrou's visit to the opening of the air show in protest over the Israeli presence.",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 At least 34 Palestinians were killed Monday in new shootings near food distribution centers run by a controversial Israeli- and U.S.-backed group in the south of the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said. The toll was the deadliest yet in the near-daily shootings that have taken place as thousands of Palestinians move through Israeli military-controlled areas to try to reach the food \"hubs\" run by the private contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Two witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire early Monday in an attempt to control the crowds. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military. It has said after numerous previous instances that troops had fired warning shots at what it called suspect individuals approaching their positions.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said 33 Palestinians were killed trying to reach the GHF center near the southern city of Rafah on Monday while another was fatally shot trying to reach a GHF hub in central Gaza. It said four other people were killed elsewhere in the war-torn enclave.",
      "Two Palestinians trying to get food at the Rafah site, Heba Jouda and Mohammed Abed, told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired on the crowds at around 4 a.m. at the Flag Roundabout. The traffic circle, hundreds of yards from the GHF center, has repeatedly been the scene of shootings. The military has designated specific routes to access the food centers, and GHF has warned aid-seekers that leaving the roads is dangerous, but many do in an attempt to get to the food first.",
      "Israel and the United States say the new GHF system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid. GHF says there has been no violence in or around the sites themselves. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors.",
      "U.S. allies sanction Israeli cabinet members \"for inciting violence\" in West Bank",
      "U.S. allies sanction Israeli cabinet members \"for inciting violence\" in West Bank",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of the 20-month Israel-Hamas war, have rejected the new system, saying it can't meet the territory's needs and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, slammed GHF in a statement on Monday as a \"lethal distribution system\" and lamented that \"tragedies go on unabated\" in Gaza \"while attention shifts elsewhere,\" in an apparent reference to the new outbreak of significant fighting between Israel and Iran.",
      "Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran's nuclear sites and senior scientists and commanders late on Thursday, sparking an ongoing exchange of fire that the Israeli military says has killed at least two dozen civilians in the country, and reportedly hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"Scores of people have been killed & injured in the past days including of starving people trying to get some food from a lethal distribution system,\" Lazzarini said in a social media post. \"Restrictions on bringing in aid from the UN including @UNRWA continue despite an abundance of assistance ready to be moved into Gaza. In addition, severe shortages of fuel are now hampering the delivery of critical services especially health & water. Killings & wars will breed more wars & bloodshed. Civilians will always suffer first & suffer most.\"",
      "Israeli officials have repeatedly accused United Nations aid agencies of failing to collect and distribute food it allows into Gaza, a significant portion of which the Israeli military now controls and warns civilians to avoid due to its ongoing operations.",
      "Palestinian health officials say scores of people have been killed and hundreds wounded since the GHF sites opened last month. Experts, including U.N. agency chiefs, have warned that Israel's ongoing military campaign and restrictions on the entry of aid have put Gaza, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, at risk of famine.",

      "The Israeli military targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, research scientists and senior military commanders in dozens of preemptive airstrikes early Friday morning in what it dubbed \"Operation Rising Lion.\"",
      "The strikes \u2014 which the Israel Defense Forces said included dropping \"over 330 different munitions\" on more than 100 targets in Iran \u2014 prompted Iran to launch about 100 missiles at Israel in a retaliatory attack later Friday. The IDF said its Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the missiles, and U.S. officials confirmed that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin claimed intelligence showed \"the Iranian regime has made significant progress in achieving nuclear capability and its ability to act against us,\" calling it an emerging and existential threat to Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not involved in Israel's airstrikes on Iran.",
      "The attacks came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.",
      "The IAEA is the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog. It said in a confidential report last month that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.",
      "President Trump on Friday urged Iran to \"make a deal, before there is nothing left\" and to agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy, was set to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in the Gulf state of Oman on Sunday.",
      "Here's a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran's program.",
      "Natanz enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 135 miles southeast of Tehran, is the country's main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran's Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz's southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "In\u00a0testimony Friday before the U.N.\u00a0about Israel's strikes, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Iran confirmed that its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant had been attacked. He said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% had \"been destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged. He said Iranian authorities also reported attacks on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and Esfahan site.",
      "Fordo enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 60 miles southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn't as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries,\u00a0Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Bushehr nuclear power plant",
      "Iran's only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr\u00a0on the Persian Gulf, some 465 miles south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.",
      "Arak heavy water reactor",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor\u00a0is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "The U.S. withdrew from the international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019.",
      "Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center",
      "The facility in Isfahan, some 215 miles southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "Tehran Research Reactor",
      "The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country's atomic program. The U.S. actually provided Iran the reactor in 1967 as part of America's \"Atoms for Peace\" program during the Cold War.

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "An audio message Diddy sent to his ex-girlfriend, Jane, was played in court during his sex trafficking and racketeering trial. (audio credit: US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of NY)",
      "The fifth week of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering case saw the completion of \"Jane's\" testimony.",
      "Diddy's ex-girlfriend first took the stand on June 5, finishing her testimony on June 13. Testifying under a pseudonym, Jane told the jury about her relationship with Diddy from 2021 until his arrest in 2024. She claimed Diddy forced her into participating in \"hotel nights\" where the \"Last Night\" rapper expected her to have sex with a male escort while he watched.",
      "\"Overall, the testimony this week from Jane could have been puzzling to the jury,\" defense attorney John W. Day told Fox News Digital. \"Did she pull together for jurors the web of Diddy's control and intimidation that builds the foundation for RICO convictions? She did say she felt like a 'sex worker in my own relationship,' which suggests an element of control on Diddy's part.\"",
      "DIDDY'S ALLEGED 'SEXUAL DEVIANT' BEHAVIOR DISTRACTS FROM GOVERNMENT'S CASE: EXPERT",
      "\"The jury may use her testimony to understand why someone would engage in that type of conduct, and yet they still may feel conflicted about her participation in these sex acts and her relationship with Diddy. She testified as a prosecution witness, but did she raise more questions than she answered in the mind of the jurors about why she continued to engage with Diddy? I believe the testimony from Jane cuts both ways,\" Day noted.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs confers with his lawyers after a meeting with the judge during his sex trafficking trial on June 12. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Jane's dayslong testimony \"painted a portrait\" similar to that of Diddy's ex, Cassie Ventura. However, one legal expert told Fox News Digital Jane's allegations might not be enough to convince a jury Diddy's behavior was criminal.",
      "\"Jane\u2019s testimony highlighted the defendant's use of his wealth and resources, factors which were portrayed by the prosecutors as a means to control and force these women into sexual situations with paid male escorts, or, by the defense, to foster loving consensual relationships that happened to include sex with male prostitutes,\" John J. Perlstein, a Los Angeles based litigator, told Fox News Digital. \"I think the most interesting part is that the defendant\u2019s conduct isn\u2019t in dispute \u2013 it's simply up to the jury to decide whether that conduct was, in fact, criminal.\"",
      "A sketch portrays a scene from federal court during the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial on June 13. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Here's a look at the most explosive moments from Jane's testimony.",
      "Diddy's alleged reaction to public release of his attack on Cassie Ventura",
      "Jane's testimony gave the jury insight into how Diddy reacted when surveillance footage of the rapper attacking Cassie Ventura went public in May 2024. Jane said she was dating Diddy at the time and was at his home, where she allegedly witnessed his family come together to make a game plan for his response.",
      "\"She said she saw him consult with his team and go into damage control mode to counter the negative publicity,\" Day, owner of the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based, law practice John Day Law, said.",

      "Jane later explained that she never experienced Combs' alleged violence before the video came out. It wasn't until June 2024 that Jane alleged Diddy first laid hands on her.",
      "\"So she [allegedly] experienced domestic violence firsthand in the relationship,\" Day explained. \"In fact, she said that occurred not long after the video of Cassie being assaulted at a hotel showed up on television. It\u2019s rare for a witness to provide such a 360-degree view of what role violence plays in a defendant\u2019s relationship with women.\"",

      "Jane's longest \u2018hotel night\u2019",
      "At one point in Jane's testimony, she claimed the longest \"hotel night\" she experienced was during New Year's in 2022. The \"hotel night\" allegedly lasted three days and involved three different men. After the alleged sex session, Jane confronted Diddy about a trip he took another woman on.",
      "Jane read her text message to Diddy in court. She wrote, \"It's not right how you're treating me right now and how you're doing me. We had such an amazing New Year's Eve week together, and the last thing I would expect from you is coming at me sideways about a girl you like. To even be speaking to me about another female, worried about her to me, is something I've never seen before. You completely had your way and more with New Year's Eve week, just to send me home to worry about a doctor's visit, handling entertainment, accuse me of lying, then take another girl on vacation. Ignoring us for days to prioritize that right now shows where your care is, and it's not for me. Cold. I'd never make you feel like that. We have been so good. You were telling me you love me, I'm your baby, how you're not going to use me, all to treat me like this. Why? You have me feeling so taken advantage of and regretting everything.\"",
      "Diddy's ex-girlfriend testified during the fifth week of trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "A legal expert explained why Jane's testimony could be seen as harmful to the prosecution.",
      "\"The danger for the prosecution is that jurors might see in this testimony reasons why a person might feel scorned by Diddy and now be happy to seek revenge,\" Day explained. \"This kind of witness testimony is relatable to jurors, whether they have personal experience or know people who have gone through a horrendous moment in a relationship.\"",

      "Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani explained to Fox News Digital, \"Jane was Combs' most recent girlfriend up until the time of his arrest. And there were text messages from her to Combs in which she said she's not a sex robot, porn star or animal and that she didn't want to have sex with strangers. We heard audio of Jane asking the sex workers to wear a condom and Combs telling them not to. That's evidence of force and coercion for sex trafficking.\"",
      "\"We also heard that one of the entertainers sold a sex tape of a freak off to a big media company,\" said Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers. \"That must be the video that one of the victim's lawyers said they had seen. An HSI agent testified about the drugs and guns found when they raided Combs' L.A. home with more than a thousand bottles of baby oil and lube.\"",
      "Diddy is paying for Jane's lawyer, despite her testimony against him",
      "Jane testified that Diddy was still paying for her lawyer and her rent. During cross-examination, the rapper's defense confirmed he had never interfered with Jane's representation.",
      "\"Another part of Jane\u2019s testimony that probably came as a shock to some people was when she said that Diddy is still paying for her lawyer. But lawyers watching the trial understand this type of arrangement is fairly common,\" Day explained. \"It may, however, raise questions with jurors about conflicts of interest and motivation. Jurors might look at this arrangement as questionable and that would affect their perception of what Jane has testified to.\"",

      "Jane testified Thursday about an alleged violent altercation she experienced at her home in June 2024. Jane testified that she called Diddy a \"pedophile\" while confronting him about a younger woman and that Combs kicked the doors in her home \"literally off the hinges\" while following her around. Jane said she felt the fight escalated after she pushed Combs' head into a marble countertop and threw candles toward the rapper.

      "\"Sean kicked me from the back of my thigh, and then I fell down on my butt,\" Jane testified. \"And then he picked me up in a chokehold and choked me.\" Jane claimed she ran about six blocks away from the home and waited for approximately two hours before returning. Once home, the fight between her and Combs continued. As the fight turned physical, Jane recalled Combs punching her twice. She ran into the backyard and laid down in the grass, covering her face, head and body with her hands. Combs allegedly punched and kicked her \"several times\" while in this position before he dragged her back into the home.",

      "The Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, Medicaid and a slew of other items baked into the House GOP\u2019s version of the bill, released its text as Republicans sprint to finish work on the president\u2019s bill ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.",

      "The committee, chaired by Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, walked a tightrope with the legislation, given the push and pull surrounding divisive cuts to Medicaid, an increase to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and other provisions in the House\u2019s version of the bill.",
      "Crapo lauded the bill in a statement and noted that it made the president's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, slashed \"Green New Deal\" spending and targeted \"waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable.\"",

      "One of the thorniest issues in the House was the SALT cap hike, and blue-state Republicans vowed to vote against the bill unless their demands for a sizable increase were met.",
      "The Senate\u2019s offering drastically undercut the House GOP\u2019s negotiated cap, instead permanently extending the current $10,000 deduction cap starting at the end of this year. However, tax writers view the modified cap change as more of a placeholder number while deliberations continue.",
      "But Republicans from New York and California have already come out in force against the proposed change and contended that lowering the cap at all was non-negotiable.",
      "\"Instead of undermining the deal already in place and putting the entire bill at risk, the Senate should work with us to keep our promise of historic tax relief and deliver on our Republican agenda,\" SALT Caucus co-chairs Reps.

      "Another stark departure in the Senate\u2019s healthcare language is Medicaid. Despite a cohort of Republicans warning to avoid deeper cuts that could lead to people being booted from their healthcare or negative effects on rural hospitals, lawmakers on the panel appear to have further dug in on slashes to the program.",
      "For example, the Senate\u2019s bill proposed halting an increase to the provider tax rate, or the amount that state Medicaid programs pay to healthcare providers on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries, for non-Affordable Care Act expansion states, and lowering the rate in expansion states annually until it hits 3.5 percent. The House version just paused the increase.",
      "The Senate\u2019s offering also lowered the House\u2019s proposed maximum Child Tax Credit from $2,500 to $2,200 while making the credit permanent. The House\u2019s bill offered the increased credit until 2029, at which point it would revert to $2,000.",
      "And on green energy tax credits, including those for electric vehicles, green energy upgrades to homes and others, the Senate offered more flexibility with their rollback timelines of Biden-era green energy subsidies ushered in by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The House version moved up the expiration date for many credits to the end of this year, while the Senate's version tweaked the language in some places to allow for 90- and 180-day windows after the bill\u2019s enactment. In some cases, the credits were given an entire year before they were slated to expire.",

      "Notably, the committee\u2019s legislation would also increase the debt limit to $5 trillion, a $1 trillion hike over the House\u2019s offering. The inclusion of a debt limit hike has been a sore subject for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has argued that he would prefer to vote on the debt limit separately.",
      "Part of the impetus to advance the Senate\u2019s version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" however, is to beat the debt guillotine hanging over lawmakers\u2019 heads. The Treasury Department has forecast that Congress has until August to increase the debt limit.",

      "Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, is among the top names being rumored for a 2028 presidential run.",
      "Over the last week, he has been locked in a protracted war of words, which has also manifested itself in a court battle, over President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the riots in Los Angeles. Newsom has called Trump\u2019s use of the National Guard and Marines to respond to the rioting both \"immoral\" and \"illegal.\"",
      "A longtime progressive, Newsom has recently moved to present himself as more of a centrist, starting a podcast titled \"This is Gavin Newsom\" that hosted the likes of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.",
      "According to Catholic Vote\u2019s report, however, Newsom is \"one of America\u2019s most radical, destructive politicians\" who \"remains the same ideologue who has trampled parental rights, championed the transgender mutilation of children, and taken pro-abortion advocacy to a sickening extreme.\"",

Gavin Newsom\u2019s \"extreme\" and \"viciously anti-Christian agenda.\" (Getty Images)",
      "\"California\u2019s governor claims to be a Catholic \u2018man of faith,\u2019\" says the report. \"But he has a viciously anti-Christian agenda for America.\"",
      "Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Newsom, responded to the report by telling Fox News Digital that \"we're not taking seriously any organization co-founded by a political hack who has sworn allegiance to President Trump, called Pope Francis\u2019 papacy a ruse, and justified cutting off U.S. foreign aid for the poor and hungry because he'd read some conspiracy theory about transgender mice experiments.\"",
      "Catholic Vote endorsed Trump for president in 2024 and Catholic Vote founder Brian Burch was selected to be the administration's U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.",
      "Richards said, \"we encourage Catholic Vote, which does not represent the Catholic Church, to read Leviticus:\u00a0\u2018You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the\u00a0Lord\u00a0your God.\u2019\"",
      "The report highlights how, despite his recent rebranding, Newsom has long been at the forefront of pushing for ever more liberal policies, championing causes such as abortion and transgender treatments for children.",
      "\"Gavin Newsom may be adjusting his style and image. But he remains the same ideologue who has trampled parental rights, championed the transgender mutilation of children, and taken pro-abortion advocacy to a sickening extreme,\" says the report.",

      "Catholic Vote takes particular issue with Newsom\u2019s abortion advocacy, pointing to how he has aggressively expanded abortion in California, signing 12 pro-abortion bills in a single month in September 2022 and nine more again in 2023. The report says that despite professing to be a Catholic, Newsom has not only advocated for a right to abortion, but even used biblical scripture to advertise and promote abortion.",
      "The report points to how, as governor, Newsom commissioned billboards in Oklahoma that advertised \"Need an abortion? California is here to help,\" with a quote from the Bible saying, \"Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no greater commandment than these.\"",
      "\"This was deemed \u2018unconscionable\u2019 by the California Catholic Conference, and a \u2018reprehensible act of gross blasphemy\u2019 by a leading Protestant pastor. A statement from the Catholic League summed it up best, calling the billboard campaign \u2018demonic,\u2019\" says the report.",

      "Catholic Vote stated that \"Few figures demonstrate the drift of America\u2019s political Left \u2013 away from the Clinton-era language of \u2018safe, legal, and rare,\u2019 and toward today\u2019s \u2018#ShoutYourAbortion\u2019 attitude \u2013 better than Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "The report also points to how Newsom has led the nation to \"warp\" the concept of parental choice to use it as a tool to advance transgender treatments for children. It points to how Newsom signed a bill in 2022 making California the nation\u2019s first \"sanctuary state\" for parents from other jurisdictions seeking to give their children hormone treatment, puberty-blocking drugs and more. It says that in 2023, Newsom again \"doubled down on this strategy of imposing radical ideology and calling it \u2018freedom.\u2019 When he instituted new penalties on public school districts that fail to promote homosexuality and transgenderism to children, he framed this as a matter of \u2018families\u2019 having \u2018the freedom to decide what\u2019s right for them.\u2019\"",
      "According to the report, Newsom\u2019s office released a statement in 2023 after he signed a slate of \"Supporting LGBTQ+ Californians\" policies that declared \"hate-filled attacks\" of \"far-right extremists\" would \"not be tolerated.\"",
      "Catholic Vote said that \"if California is indeed \u2018America\u2019s Coming Attraction,\u2019 as Newsom claims, believers in Biblical truth \u2013 and biological reality \u2013 should be gravely concerned.\"",

Instead, Gavin Newsom was busy dreaming of the White House and spending taxpayer funds to put up billboards in Oklahoma that quote the Bible and urge people to fly to California to get an abortion,\" he said.\u00a0\"With his wacky priorities, it's no wonder people are fleeing California in droves.\"",

      "But there were huddles on the floor during the vote itself. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., chatted with Johnson and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn. A few moments later, LaLota and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who was a no, switched their ballots to yes.",
      "Rep. Tom Emmer speaks during the Republican National Convention Tuesday, Jul. 16, 2024, in Milwaukee.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)",
      "Republicans gaveled the vote closed at 214-212.",
      "\"I ultimately voted yes after a conversation or two with the Speaker and the Whip raised my confidence level,\" said LaLota. \"I trust those two individuals. We've dealt with each other for the last couple of years. We've gotten on the same page.\"",
      "Bacon had spoken glowingly in recent days about his relationship with public broadcasters in Nebraska. He also had reservations about cutting PEPFAR, the global AIDS mitigation effort. But now Bacon didn\u2019t fry his party.",
      "\"I was assured that PBS would receive funding in this year\u2019s budget. And I discussed PEPFAR with the speaker,\" said the Nebraska Republican.",
      "A few moments later, Johnson was outside the House chamber, bragging about his colleagues for passing the bill.",
      "\"We are fulfilling the promises we made to the American people,\" said Johnson. \"Today's passage of this initial rescissions package marks a critical step towards a more responsible and transparent government that puts the interests of the American taxpayers first.\"",
      "Failing to pass this teardrop of spending reductions amid a deep federal sea would have been catastrophic for the GOP. Again, especially because of all the braggadocio about cutting spending. Now Republicans can focus on bigger and more controversial spending cut requests from the Trump administration.",
      "But few reporters cared much about what Johnson had to say at that moment because of the immediate mania involving Padilla. The Capitol descended into chaos. The outcome of the critical vote was relegated to a footnote on a wild news day. By nightfall, no one was talking about the rescissions package at all. Let alone Padilla.",
      "Despite the staggering news traffic, the vote notched yet another narrow victory for Johnson and House Republicans. Like it or not, Johnson has piloted the fractious House Republican Conference to a series of slim victories on tough bills all year long.",
      "In February, the House narrowly approved its initial framework for the Big, Beautiful Bill. The outline was essential to help ease eventual passage in the Senate. At one point, it looked like Republicans lacked the votes. In fact, House leaders began sending Members home for the night. Then, they suddenly reversed themselves. Johnson and the GOP eked out a 217-215 victory, approving the framework and sending it to the Senate.",
      "Switch one vote, and the gig was up. The House and Senate would not be on the same page with a budget framework for the touchstone of President Trump\u2019s agenda. That would neutralize the entire exercise.",
      "A few weeks later, the House approved an interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, 217-213. Again a narrow vote. Only Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted nay. Flip two votes and the tally is 215-215. Again, a tie vote kills the bill.",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie attends the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "The Senate okayed one framework for the Big, Beautiful Bill in February. Another one in the spring. But the House and Senate still weren\u2019t on the same page. In mid-April, the House and Senate finally aligned. The House adopted the Senate\u2019s final blueprint for the Big, Beautiful Bill, 216-214. Massie and Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., voted nay. Again, change one vote and it\u2019s a tie. Defeat would have stalled the process for the Big, Beautiful Bill.",
      "Finally, Johnson and the GOP scored perhaps their biggest win of the year in mid-May. The House voted 215-214 with one member voting \"present\" to pass the initial version of the Big, Beautiful Bill and send it to the Senate. Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., had problems with the bill. But missed the vote because he fell asleep as the House debated the measure in the middle of the night. House Freedom Caucus Chairman and Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., also had reservations. But he cast the \"present\" vote. Either of these members could have tanked the legislation had they voted nay.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was the master at lugging challenging votes across the finish line by a vote or two. She\u2019s the reason Obamacare passed. But Pelosi often had larger majorities. Her secret sauce was understanding what members needed to vote yes on controversial legislation.",

      "The speaker has Trump on his side and a GOP conference that is willing to do practically whatever he wants. That helps a lot. But Johnson\u2019s resume of pushing through tough bills by the tiniest of margins is beginning to mirror Pelosi\u2019s success. However, the level of difficulty is higher for Johnson thanks to the minuscule majority.",
      "Pelosi was a parliamentary maestro when she was Speaker. And so far during his speakership, Johnson has defied political gravity. But whether you like Johnson\u2019s politics or not, keen political observers are noticing that he has a knack for pulling off the seemingly unachievable. That was long the calling card of Pelosi.",
      "And it may eventually prove to be the calling card of Johnson, too.",

      "For context, the current V-Class starts at about $60,000 in Germany and can exceed $100,000 with options, so it's reasonable to expect the Vision V to command a significant premium, positioning it well above existing luxury van offerings. As with most high-end vehicles, the final price will likely depend on customization and selected features, but the Vision V is clearly aimed at buyers seeking exclusivity and the ultimate in automotive luxury.",

      "In the past decade, healthcare data has become one of the most sought-after targets in cybercrime. From insurers to clinics, every player in the ecosystem handles some form of sensitive information.",
      "However, breaches do not always originate from hospitals or health apps. Increasingly, patient data is managed by third-party vendors offering digital services such as scheduling, billing and marketing.",
      "One such breach at a digital marketing agency serving dental practices recently exposed approximately 2.7 million patient profiles and more than 8.8 million appointment records.",

      "Massive healthcare data leak exposes millions: What you need to know",
      "Cybernews researchers have discovered a misconfigured MongoDB database exposing 2.7 million patient profiles and 8.8 million appointment records. The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",
      "The exposed data included names, birthdates, addresses, emails, phone numbers, gender, chart IDs, language preferences and billing classifications. Appointment records also contained metadata such as timestamps and institutional identifiers.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "Clues within the data structure point toward Gargle, a Utah-based company that builds websites and offers marketing tools for dental practices. While not a confirmed source, several internal references and system details suggest a strong connection. Gargle provides appointment scheduling, form submission and patient communication services. These functions require access to patient information, making the firm a likely link in the exposure.",
      "After the issue was reported, the database was secured. The duration of the exposure remains unknown, and there is no public evidence indicating whether the data was downloaded by malicious actors before being locked down.",

      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data. Although Gargle is not a healthcare provider, its access to patient-facing infrastructure could place it under the scope of that regulation as a business associate.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",

      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains.

      "If you\u2019ve ever searched for your name and found personal details, like your address, on unfamiliar websites, you\u2019re not alone. People finder platforms collect this information from public records and third-party data brokers, then publish and share it widely. They often link your address to other details such as phone numbers, email addresses and even relatives.",

      "While this data may already be public in various places, these sites make it far easier to access and monetize it at scale. In one recent breach,\u00a0more than 183 million login credentials were exposed through an unsecured database. Many of these records were linked to physical addresses, raising concerns about how multiple sources of personal data can be combined and exploited.",
      "Although people finder sites claim to help reconnect friends or locate lost contacts, they also make sensitive personal information available to anyone willing to pay. This includes scammers, spammers and identity thieves who use it for fraud, harassment, and targeted scams.",

      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advises people to\u00a0request the removal of their private data, including home addresses, from people search sites due to the associated risks of stalking, scamming and other crimes.",
      "People search sites are\u00a0a goldmine for cybercriminals looking to target and profile potential victims as well as plan comprehensive cyberattacks.

      "How to protect your home address",
      "The good news is that you can take steps to reduce the risks and keep your address private. However, keep in mind that data brokers and people search sites can re-list your information after some time, so you might need to request data removal periodically.",
      "I recommend a few ways to\u00a0delete your private information, including your home address, from such websites.",
      "1. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0Data brokers can sell your home address and other personal data to multiple businesses and individuals, so the key is to act fast. If you\u2019re looking for an easier way to protect your privacy, a data removal service can do the heavy lifting for you, automatically requesting data removal from brokers and tracking compliance.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations.

      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",

You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk.

Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",

      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available.

      "Now, a California startup called Atom Bodies is making headlines for its groundbreaking approach to prosthetic technology.",

      "How the Atom Touch prosthetic arm uses AI and muscle signals",
      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",
      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",

      "Atom Touch stands out for several reasons. It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use. Atom Bodies has already attracted significant interest, with over 11,000 people on its\u00a0wait list and plans to begin clinical trials within the next year, pending FDA approval.",

While state-of-the-art myoelectric arms can cost around $200,000, Atom Bodies plans to offer Atom Touch for approximately $25,000.

      "According to the same official, Iran\u2019s military had gathered its top air force brass in one facility as part of a publicized drill meant to project deterrence. Instead, it exposed them. \"It was partly luck, but also planned\u2014the ability to see them in real time and strike with precision,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a reminder of what happened in Lebanon\u2014taking out contaminated leadership with surgical intelligence.\"",
      "That operation in Lebanon, often referred to as the \"pagers\" operation, saw Israel infiltrate and sabotage Hezbollah\u2019s command network using Chinese-made radios embedded with explosives.

      "\"I think this is so much more substantial,\" said Nadav Eyal, an Israeli journalist and analyst for \"Yediot Ahronot\" newspaper. \"What was done here was much more than the James Bond kind of type of pagers operation.

      "The Mossad\u2019s infiltration campaign involved the quiet smuggling of sophisticated weaponry into Iran, hidden inside vehicles and embedded near strategic targets. In central Iran, precision-guided weapons were planted near surface-to-air missile batteries and launched on command. Disguised vehicles were also used to destroy Iran\u2019s air defense systems at the moment of the strike. Meanwhile, explosive drones positioned near Tehran were activated to destroy long-range missile launchers at the Esfajabad base.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump had opposed Israeli action against Iran, but came to believe Israel had reason to act and that the U.S. would have to lend some support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

    "summary": "The legislation keeps some House provisions, like new Medicaid rules, while making significant changes in other areas, including Medicare and the state and local tax deduction.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee released their portion of the massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda on Monday, with some significant changes compared with the House-passed package.",
      "The 549-page bill extends the expiring Trump tax cuts and includes provisions to slash taxes on tips and overtime pay.",
      "It contains a slew of Medicaid spending cuts and new rules, including work requirements that would kick in at the end of 2026, like the House bill. It also contains policies to force more frequent checks on eligibility and tougher screenings to prove lawful immigration status, in order for people to keep their coverage.",
      "Another Medicaid change is more aggressive than the House bill.",
      "\u201cThe House bill placed a moratorium on taxes on providers that help states fund their Medicaid programs and increase payments to providers for services they provide. The Senate bill goes further, limiting the provider taxes that many states already have in place, but only in states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA,\u201d said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a research group. \u201cThere were expectations that the Senate might moderate the Medicaid cuts passed by the House, but if anything they\u2019re doubling down.\u201d",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has been critical of that idea, saying it could hurt rural hospitals in his state. \u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d he said when asked about the Senate provision. \u201cIt sounds to me like this needs some work.\u201d",
      "In a major challenge to House Republicans, the Senate bill caps federal deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000 per tax filer, preserving the status quo on \u201cSALT.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s much lower than the $40,000 limit per filers with annual incomes under $500,000 that a key group of blue-state Republicans secured in the House version, after making clear it is essential to winning their vote in the narrowly divided chamber.",
      "\u201cEvidently, we\u2019re just putting down a marker for negotiation,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who added that he hopes the House-Senate SALT compromise will be a $20,000 cap.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., slammed the $10,000 cap on X, calling it \u201cDEAD ON ARRIVAL.\u201d",
      "The Senate\u2019s bill also includes changes to Medicare including new eligibility rules, including verification of citizenship or lawful permanent residency for older adults to keep getting benefits.",
      "Another provision that's also in the House bill would adjust cost-sharing rules for \u201cdual eligibles\u201d on both Medicare and Medicaid. Loren Adler, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institution, said that provision \u201cmeans 1.3 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries see higher premiums and/or cost-sharing, no longer receiving financial assistance they\u2019re eligible for,\u201d citing an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Cramer said the Medicare changes are \u201clow-hanging fruit.\u201d",
      "The Senate bill also swiftly repeals clean energy funding passed by a Democratic-led Congress in 2022, including an electric vehicle tax credit, while tilting the playing field back toward fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cI look forward to continued coordination with our colleagues in the House and the Administration to deliver President Trump\u2019s bold economic agenda for the American people as quickly as possible,\u201d Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in a statement.",
      "Senate Republicans are hoping to pass the broader domestic policy package by July 4, with the goal of sending it to Trump\u2019s desk by the end of next month.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/migrant-smugglers-deadlier-routes-southern-border-rcna212899",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 18:13:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The flow of migrants has dropped significantly, but thousands are still trying to cross, and smugglers are increasingly finding ways to send migrants alone through treacherous terrain.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a more than 90% drop in the number of migrant apprehensions at the border since President Donald Trump took office, people continue to try to reach the United States \u2014\u00a0and smugglers are taking them along more dangerous routes, according to authorities and groups assisting migrants.",
      "In recent months, human smugglers have adopted another method to bring migrants into the country via the southern border: They are sending them alone through inhospitable terrain while guiding them remotely using cellphones, Jesus Vasavilbaso, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Arizona, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "An increasing number of people are being found by law enforcement in the desert without a \"coyote,\" or smuggler, he said. They're dehydrated, dressed in camouflage and with pieces of carpet stuck to the soles of their shoes in an attempt to hide their tracks on the sand. The clothing is part of a crossing package that coyotes sell them, the Border Patrol agent said.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t buy that kit, they won\u2019t let you cross. It comes with camouflage, with those mats you put under your shoes, and a backpack with supplies, whether it\u2019s water, IV drip, tortillas, or canned food. And that also includes your cellphone,\u201d Vasavilbaso explained.",
      "More closures \u2014 and more dangerous routes",
      "Between February and April, 24,000 apprehensions were recorded along the southwest border, the majority in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley sectors in Texas, the Arizona desert and the San Diego sector in California, according to federal data.",
      "The nationalities of those crossing have shifted since the Biden administration, returning to the historical pattern led by Mexicans, given their geographic proximity. In April 2024 and 2023, migrants from Mexico accounted for one-third of all apprehensions; in April this year they accounted for 73%.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Mexicans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and occasionally people who aren\u2019t from the (American) continent. The majority we\u2019re encountering now are unaccompanied adults. Very rarely do we see a family. And we have seen two or three unaccompanied children,\u201d Vasavilbaso said.",
      "Crossing through the desert and mountains is in itself very dangerous, and with the increased border security \u2014 Trump sent 1,500 additional troops to build barriers, and the Mexican government, under threat of tariffs, reinforced border patrols with 10,000 members of the National Guard \u2014 smugglers are turning to more remote and risky routes to try to evade federal controls.",
      "\u201cThey are no longer crossing through places where they typically crossed. ... Right now we are seeing that people are crossing through a very difficult mountain,\u201d Pedro R\u00edos, director of the border program for the American Friends Service Committee in San Diego, California, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "R\u00edos is referring to Otay Mountain in eastern San Diego County, a difficult-to-access wilderness area with rocky passes and extreme conditions. On Feb. 14, in two separate incidents, three migrant border crossers \u2014 a woman and two adult men \u2014 died on the mountain during a storm where temperatures \u201cdropped to near-freezing levels,\u201d according to the Border Patrol.",
      "Separately, agents responding to an emergency call found a 16-year-old girl suffering from hypothermia, without food or water, and two deceased adults. One of them was her father.",
      "On March 28, two Mexican women, one of them pregnant, were rescued from a remote canyon in Otay Mountain; they were unable to walk due to ankle injuries and they lacked food or water. Agents set up a makeshift tent for protection from the elements until they were evacuated by helicopter the following morning.",
      "\u201cAs we start seeing more closures of traditional crossing points, the crossings become much more dangerous,\u201d R\u00edos said.",
      "In Arizona, coyotes have returned to dangerous routes in the Sonoran Desert in areas such as the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, the Tohono O\u2019odham Indian Territory, the Baboquivari Mountains and around Sasabe, a remote village less than a mile from the border in Pima County, Vasavilbaso said.",
      "\u201cWhen a person crosses that town, they have to walk approximately 45 miles to reach the next paved road. So, although it\u2019s not mountainous, it\u2019s very dangerous because it will take them two to three days to get there, and they can\u2019t carry enough water and food,\u201d he said.",
      "In the summer, temperatures in the Sonoran Desert frequently exceed 104\u00b0F and sometimes reach 118\u00b0F, according to the National Park Service.",
      "In 2024, rescuers and authorities found the remains of 154 migrants in the Arizona desert, according to data from the Pima County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office and Humane Borders, which maintains a system of water stations for migrants in the Sonoran Desert.",
      "The remains were mostly discovered in the Cabeza Prieta Wilderness Area, in the low desert, and in the Tohono O\u2019odham Indigenous Territory.",
      "So far in 2025, the remains of 40 migrants have been found in Arizona. Because of the condition they were in \u2014 in many cases, skeletons \u2014 it's presumed that most of the remains belong to people who crossed months or years ago, Professor Brad Jones, director of Humane Borders, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "And while the flow of migrants along the more familiar routes south of Tucson have plummeted, Jones predicts the flow will shift to the western side of the Sonoran Desert, which is \u201ceven more remote.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a part of the desert where humanitarian groups are simply forbidden to go. And by that, I mean, a lot of the land on the Arizona-Mexico border in far western Arizona is U.S. military,\" Jones said.",
      "The deadly consequences of this shift in migration routes will become clearer over time, Jones said.",
      "\u201cMigrants come, they just take greater risks. And I suspect that in the coming weeks and months, we\u2019re going to start seeing more remains recovered in the more remote areas of Arizona,\" he said.",
      "C\u00e9sar Ortigoza, founder of the Armadillos group, a nongovernmental organization that searches for missing people along the border, warned that the Arizona military zone is one of the most dangerous for migrants.",
      "The Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range is located there. It\u2019s an active bombing range where Ortigoza and his group once found the remains of 12 migrants, including fragmented remains that led them to believe that at least one person died from a bomb blast.",
      "Ortigoza said the routes migrants are traveling through the desert require between six and 10 days to reach a highway, where smugglers are waiting.",
      "It's very difficult for them to survive all that time walking, because they have to carry a lot of water. We believe the most they could carry is eight gallons of water, which they\u2019ll run out of in two or three days,\u201d Ortigoza said in an interview in Mexico City.",
      "On May 21, border agents intercepted a coyote in a remote area near Lukeville, Arizona, walking through the desert with four migrants who had crossed the border that morning: a 49-year-old Cuban woman and a 27-year-old woman from Uzbekistan, accompanied by two young children.",
      "\u201cSmuggling through remote desert areas poses significant danger, particularly for families with children,\u201d Sean McGoffin, chief Border Patrol agent in the Tucson sector, said in a statement about the case.",
      "A new strategy: remote coordination",
      "The use of technology is changing the way smugglers operate, as they now prefer to send migrants on their own and guide them remotely through the desert. \u201cCriminal organizations are selling them cellphones. They\u2019re directing people through cellphones, giving them coordinates via WhatsApp or telling them to dial a number and then giving them directions,\u201d Vasavilbaso said.",
      "\u201cWhen I started as a Border Patrol agent 16 years ago, we always saw people regularly crossing with a coyote. Now that many people carry cellphones, they\u2019re being left to their own devices. The danger of this is that they don\u2019t know the terrain, so they have to count on having a cellphone signal to be able to make that call and also be able to understand the instructions the coyotes are giving them,\u201d he said.",
      "On Feb. 27, agents detained three migrants who had crossed the border without permission at a ranch near Carrizo Springs, Texas. They were wearing rugs on their shoe soles, which is a new practice among smugglers, Vasavilbaso explained. Smugglers attach pieces of carpet to the migrants\u2019 shoe soles so they don\u2019t leave traces in the desert that border agents can follow.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you. It\u2019s a little more difficult when they bring those carpets,\u201d though he said it wasn't impossible to follow. Nevertheless, this tactic is also \u201ca double-edged sword,\u201d according to Vasavilbaso, because when migrants end up lost and call emergency services for help, it becomes more difficult to locate them because there's no trail for agents to follow.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for us to be able to provide them with the help they need,\u201d he said.",
      "Vasavilbaso blamed criminal groups for the danger migrants face when traveling along these inhospitable border routes: \u201cIf they cross through a more dangerous area, it\u2019s because coyotes are taking them through those places. Those people didn\u2019t choose to cross there.\u201d",
      "A lucrative business that persists",
      "The desert isn\u2019t the only death trap for migrants who continue to cross illegally. The presence of authorities at highways and border cities has led smugglers to make risky decisions and abandon migrants to their fate regardless of the conditions, authorities say.",
      "On March 28, two migrants from Guatemala, including a 14-year-old boy, drowned near Elsa, Texas, after the smuggler transporting them in a pickup truck drove into a canal while being pursued by authorities. The victims had crossed the Rio Grande River with a group of 11 others earlier that morning. The mother of the deceased boy, Juana Veronica Macario-Chan, who was also in the vehicle, told authorities she had agreed to pay $16,000 to be taken with her two children to Los Angeles, California, according to court documents.",
      "Despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump administration, human smuggling remains a lucrative business for criminal organizations, which continue to charge for transporting people to U.S. territory or simply for permission to cross the border, Vasavilbaso said.",
      "\u201cCriminal organizations control the border on the Mexican side, and no one crosses without their permission,\" he added.",
      "On May 9, following a chase along the highways of Laredo, Texas, Border Patrol agents apprehended four Mexican migrants who had crossed the river as well as the coyote who had loaded them into a vehicle. One of the migrants, Omar Osiel Ruiz G\u00f3mez, told border agents he had paid $7,000 to cross and travel to Houston. The four migrants were taken into Border Patrol custody. The coyote who transported them, Humberto Garc\u00eda, faces charges of bringing and transporting undocumented migrants to the United States. He has pleaded not guilty, according to court documents.",
      "On May 22, agents arrested three more migrants \u2014 two Mexicans and one Honduran \u2014\u00a0who crossed the Rio Grande River in McAllen. One of them admitted to paying $2,500 for permission to cross. All three wore bracelets indicating payment to the cartel, said Lt. Chris Olivarez, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety.",
      "In another case, a 15-year-old boy from Reynosa, Mexico, who was arrested on May 21 in Hidalgo County, Texas, while guiding a group of migrants across the river, told police that the organization that recruited him paid him $150 for each person he managed to cross. He also explained that criminal groups use geographic coordinates and encrypted messages to coordinate trips.",
      "The young man faces charges of human smuggling and is being held at a local juvenile detention center awaiting a judge\u2019s decision on his case, Lieutenant Olivarez told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Despite increased border security and the Trump administration\u2019s restrictive immigration policies, Vasavilbaso acknowledged it's \u201cimpossible\u201d to stop the crossing of undocumented immigrants across the southern border of the United States.",
      "\u201cEver since man existed, there have been people who migrate. Humans will always look for a way to find a better life \u2014 I think it\u2019s impossible to stop it, but we can have a controlled way of how people migrate,\u201d he said.",
      "He also issued a warning to those considering crossing the border without papers. \u201cDon\u2019t take the risk, as it\u2019s dangerous, and the possibility of being detected, detained, and returned to your country is higher than ever.\u201d",
      "An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo."

    "summary": "Lawmakers are pushing congressional leaders to take greater steps to ensure their safety as elected officials confront the growing risk of violence.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The targeted shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers has renewed an urgent debate on Capitol Hill as members of Congress raise alarm bells about their safety amid escalating political rhetoric and violent threats.",
      "Law enforcement officials have begun holding a series of security briefings with groups of congressional lawmakers that will continue into Tuesday. Lawmakers have been told that they can spend money from their office budgets on home security systems and campaign cash on private security. Only a handful of congressional leaders get 24-hour protection from Capitol Police security details, though members can request extra protection, which is assigned based on whether Capitol Police determine there is an active threat.",
      "But so far, those assurances have done little to calm nervous lawmakers, who have been harboring such concerns amid a string of violent attacks on American politicians over the past 15 years \u2014 a period that has included assassination attempts on a presidential candidate and members of Congress and a riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary as sh--,\u201d a senior House lawmaker said, describing how members of Congress feel after the Minnesota shootings. \u201cWe have had new safety and security procedures in place since Jan. 6, 2021. They include coordinating my district travel with local law enforcement. We will review those in light of the assassination in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Authorities said Monday that the suspect, Vance Boelter, visited the homes of four elected officials early Saturday impersonating a police officer. Authorities say he shot and killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, shortly after he seriously wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife in a separate shooting at their home. He was arrested Sunday night.",
      "A lengthy list of names of Democratic officials found in Boelter\u2019s vehicle included those of several members of Congress, such as Sens. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Reps. Angie Craig of Minnesota, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Greg Landsman of Ohio.",
      "\u201cBoth with the president and his administration and with members of Congress ... we need to bring the temperature down,\u201d Baldwin told reporters in the Capitol on Monday night. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for political violence ever. Words matter.\u201d",
      "Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., said Monday that she was canceling a town hall Monday evening after she learned her name was also on the suspect\u2019s list.",
      "\u201cOpen, honest dialogue with West Michigan is at the heart of my service\u2013and I will not be deterred from standing up for this community,\u201d Scholten said in a statement. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and to not divert additional law enforcement resources away from protecting the broader public at this time, this is the responsible choice.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers press congressional leaders about security",
      "After the Minnesota shootings, House Democratic leaders pressed their Republican counterparts Monday to do more to protect members of Congress.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Rep. Joe Morelle, D.N.Y., the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, asked Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to boost House members\u2019 official budgets \u201cto support additional safety and security measures in every single office.\u201d",
      "Some members of Congress have complained that there isn\u2019t enough money in the office budgets to go around and that spending it on security can take away from other critical needs. To raise the budget for offices, Congress would need to approve an increase in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill.",
      "\u201cWhile we differ in many areas related to policy and our vision for America\u2019s future, Member safety must be an area of common ground,\u201d Jeffries and Morelle wrote in a letter. \u201cRepresentatives from both sides of the aisle have endured assassination attempts that changed their lives and careers forever. Too many other patriotic public servants have left Congress because they no longer felt safe carrying out their duty as elected officials.\u201d",
      "In response to the attempt to assassinate U.S. District Judge Esther Salas of New Jersey in 2020, Congress passed a bill in 2022 to protect judges\u2019 personally identifiable information and allow them to redact personal information in certain cases online.",
      "In the wake of the Minnesota shootings, lawmakers have renewed discussions about passing a bill that would give themselves the same protections, according to a source with knowledge of the talks.",
      "\u201cI have long advocated for data privacy for everyone, including the residences of lawmakers, and I have encountered resistance in the past,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. \u201cMaybe these horrific murders will change the sentiment within Congress.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, House Republicans held an hourlong virtual call with House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland and Capitol Police leaders to discuss security concerns.",
      "The call got tense, according to two members who were on it. Ten to 15 lawmakers spoke up, expressing concerns about their safety, particularly when they go home to their districts.",
      "A Republican lawmaker told NBC News the call was \u201cterrible,\u201d adding that leaders have detail protection but that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d for other members, despite concerns about security before the Minnesota shootings.",
      "Another source said the call, which happened to take place on the eighth anniversary of the shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017, was almost entirely about lawmakers\u2019 needing police protection at their homes and concerns that their personal information is so readily available.",
      "McFarland walked through some of the security options that are allowed for members. And leadership assured members that further avenues will be explored to see whether more can be done to protect lawmakers at home.",
      "House Democrats are expected to hold a similar virtual briefing on security Tuesday. Senators will have an in-person briefing Tuesday, as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about lawmaker security for quite a while. People are just getting more and more brazen all the time,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who said his first cousin lives \u201ctwo doors down\u201d from the shooting in Champlin, Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s too close to home. It\u2019s so sad.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody in my family, you end up putting your head on a swivel, and you hate to live that way,\u201d he added.",
      "Elected officials face growing threats",
      "Threats to lawmakers have been steadily rising in recent years. Last year, the Capitol Police Threat Assessment Section investigated 9,474 concerning statements and direct threats against the members of Congress, their families or their staff members, an 18% increase from the previous year. The only year when more threats were recorded was 2021, in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, when police investigated 9,625 threats.",
      "On Monday, a 25-year-old Georgia man was arraigned on federal charges of making violent threats against Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Deb Fischer, R-Neb., the Justice Department said.",
      "But providing around-the-clock protection for all 535 members of Congress would be financially and logistically impractical. And Capitol Police have struggled to recruit and retain officers, even before the Jan. 6 attack, though in recent years the department has launched an aggressive recruitment effort.",
      "Instead, officials have pointed to security resources already available to lawmakers. After the Jan. 6 riot, the House sergeant at arms created a program allowing each member to use up to $10,000 to install and maintain security systems at their homes.",
      "And given threats on the campaign trail, the Federal Election Commission recently began allowing House and Senate candidates to spend campaign funds on security, including private security guards, cybersecurity and home security systems.",
      "During the 2024 election cycle, House and Senate candidates spent $8.5 million on security-related expenses, according to an NBC News review of FEC statements. That\u2019s an increase from the more than $7.5 million congressional campaigns spent in the 2022 cycle. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., led all senators, spending more than $1.2 million on such security expenses, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., led House members by spending $432,241.",
      "There have been several high-profile examples of political leaders who have been targeted for attack in recent years.",
      "In January 2011, Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., was shot in the head while she was meeting with constituents at a Tucson grocery store. Giffords survived, but six of the 18 other people wounded in the shooting died.",
      "In June 2017, a gunman opened fire on Republicans as they practiced in Alexandria, Virginia, for the annual congressional baseball charity game. Four people were shot, including Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., then the House majority whip, who nearly died.",
      "Members of the House and the Senate, along with Vice President Mike Pence, were targeted by pro-Donald Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In October 2022, a man broke into the San Francisco home of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then the House speaker, and attacked her husband with a hammer. The man was sentenced to 30 years in prison.",
      "And last July, just months before the presidential election, Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally after a gunman fired multiple rounds and struck his ear. Trump survived another attempt on his life in September while he was golfing in Florida.",
      "\"It clearly looks like a political assassination, and there's just no room for that in this country,\" GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt, the former attorney general of Missouri, said of the Minnesota shooting. \"I think it's a moment for the country to take a step back and everybody to condemn it.\""

      "Under the agreement, Dr. Salvador Plasencia will plead guilty to four counts of distributing ketamine.",
      "He faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of at least $2 million, the agreement shows.",
      "Plasencia is expected to enter the plea in court in the coming weeks.",

      "Before he died on Oct. 28, 2023, Perry, 54, had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety. But federal prosecutors said he had sought \u2014 and received \u2014 unsupervised doses and developed an \"out of control\" dependence on the drug.",
      "The anesthetic, long used for surgery and in emergency room settings, has more recently been used as an experimental treatment for some mental illnesses.",
      "When Perry was found dead in his pool, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office said the amount of ketamine found in his body was equivalent to the amount used in general anesthesia.",

      "ATLANTA \u2014 Pedro Neto scored in the first half and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez in the 79th minute to give Chelsea a 2-0 win over Los Angeles FC in Group D's Club World Cup opener on Monday.",
      "Chelsea put pressure on LAFC goalkeeper Hugo Lloris early in the match. Neto scored in the 34th minute, picking up a pass from Nicolas Jackson and cutting onto his left foot for a near-post finish.",
      "There were 22,137 fans in attendance at the 71,000-capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium, many of them backing LAFC. The Black and Gold had positive sparks of energy and possession throughout the first half, but struggled to find any real opportunities in front of goal.",
      "LAFC almost got one back just before the 60-minute mark, but Chelsea goalkeeper Robert S\u00e1nchez came up with a save to keep Denis Bouanga off the scoresheet. The Black and Gold aimed to get some more experience onto the pitch at the half, bringing on former Chelsea man Olivier Giroud.",
      "Coming in off the bench, Fern\u00e1ndez made no mistake finishing Liam Delap's cross, adding an insurance goal for The Blues.",
      "Key moment",
      "Chelsea's day was made even more positive by the debut of Delap, a promising 22-year-old English striker signed from Ipswich Town.",
      "Takeaways",
      "While Chelsea is the favorite to top Group D, LAFC's next two matches become essential to moving on to the knock-out rounds. LAFC vs. Flamengo will prove to be an entertaining game, with the two sides most likely battling it out for the group's second spot.",

      "\"We know they've got amazing players and they're a really good team, but we've got to play our football. No matter who we're playing, we play our football really confident. \u2026 You've got to pick your moments, and I think we've done that well today.\" \u2014 Levi Colwill, Chelsea defender."

    "summary": "A federal jury  Monday found that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems after the 2020 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "DENVER  \u2014 A federal jury in Colorado on Monday found that one of the nation\u2019s most prominent election conspiracy theorists, MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, defamed a former employee for a leading voting equipment company after the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The employee, Eric Coomer, sued after Lindell called him a traitor and accusations about him stealing the election were streamed on Lindell\u2019s online media platform.",
      "Coomer was the security and product strategy director at Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose voting machines became the target of elaborate conspiracy theories among allies of President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 was due to widespread fraud.",
      "Dominion won a $787 million settlement in a defamation lawsuit it filed against Fox News over its airing of false claims against the company and has another lawsuit against the conservative network Newsmax.",
      "Newsmax apologized to Coomer in 2021 for airing false allegations against him.",
      "Coomer said during the two-week Lindell trial that his career and life were destroyed by the statements. His lawyers said Lindell either knew the statements were lies, or conveyed them recklessly without knowing if they were true.",
      "Lindell\u2019s lawyers denied the claims and said his online platform, formerly known as Frankspeech, is not liable for statements made by others.",
      "Lindell said he went to trial to draw attention to the need to get rid of electronic voting machines that have been targeted in a web of conspiracy theories. He said he used to be worth about $60 million before he started speaking out about the 2020 election and is now $10 million in debt.",
      "Reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his loss in 2020 all affirmed Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Trump\u2019s attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of widespread fraud, and Trump and his allies lost dozens of court cases seeking to overturn the result.",
      "Lindell stuck by his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen during the trial, but did not call any experts to present evidence of his claims.",
      "Lindell said his beliefs that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud were influenced by watching the 2020 HBO documentary \u201cKill Chain\u201d and by the views of Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. In an interview for a documentary Lindell made in 2021, Flynn said foreign interference was going to happen in U.S. elections, and Lindell said he had no reason to doubt the claim since Flynn had worked for both political parties in intelligence.",
      "Lindell distanced himself from an account by a Colorado podcaster who claimed to have heard a conference call from the anti-fascist group Antifa before the 2020 election. The podcast claimed that on the call someone named Eric from Dominion said he would make sure that Trump would not win, a story that was recounted on Frankspeech during a 2021 event. Lindell said he only learned about that during the trial.",
      "Lindell said he never accused Coomer of rigging the election, but he did say he was upset because he said Newsmax blocked him from being able to go on air to talk about voting machines after it apologized to Coomer. Coomer denied there was any such deal to block Lindell under his agreement with the network.",
      "Coomer\u2019s lawyers tried to show how their client\u2019s life was devastated by the conspiracy theories spreading about him. Lindell was comparatively late to seize on Coomer, not mentioning him until February 2021, well after his name had been circulated by other Trump partisans.",
      "Coomer said the conspiracy theories cost him his job, his mental health and the life he\u2019d built and said Lindell\u2019s statements were the most distressing of all. He specifically pointed to a statement on May 9, 2021, when Lindell described what he believed Coomer had done as \u201ctreason.\u201d",
      "Lindell\u2019s attorneys argued that Coomer\u2019s reputation was already in tatters by the time Lindell mentioned him. They said that was partly because of Coomer\u2019s own Facebook posts disparaging Trump, which the former Dominion employee acknowledged were \u201chyperbolic\u201d and had been a mistake."

      "The investigation will focus on staffing at the march, including the responsibilities assigned to people working and volunteering at the protest. It was unclear, police said, whether the \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d were hired by event organizers or acted on their own.",
      "\u201cWhile the Salt Lake City Police Department was aware that Saturday\u2019s demonstration would include people in support roles, such as those helping to marshal or guide the crowd, these functions are entirely internal to the event,\u201d police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom the department\u2019s standpoint, these persons are considered members of the public, subject to the same rights and responsibilities as any other person in Utah,\u201d it continued.",
      "No state permit is required to purchase a rifle, shotgun or handgun in Utah.",
      "The event permit did not include any mention of armed security, police said. Neither of the men involved in Ah Loo\u2019s shooting are current or former members of law enforcement. They were wearing high-visibility neon green vests and carrying handguns.",
      "Ah Loo, 39, died Saturday night at a hospital after being struck by a bullet that was intended for a man who is now in police custody, Arturo Gamboa.",
      "Two \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d told police they saw Gamboa, 24, pull out an AR-15-style rifle from a backpack and \u201cbegin manipulating it.\u201d They shouted at Gamboa to drop his weapon, but he allegedly advanced on a crowd of protesters with his rifle raised, according to police records. One of the \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d fired three rounds at Gamboa and accidentally hit Ah Loo, police said.",
      "Gamboa received minor injuries and was arrested at the scene for investigation of murder. Although he did not fire the fatal shot, Gamboa could be charged with murder because detectives \u201cdeveloped probable cause that Gamboa acted under circumstances that showed a depraved indifference to human life, knowingly engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of death and ultimately caused the death of an innocent community member,\u201d police said.",
      "Event organizers from the 50501 Movement - Utah did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement posted to social media, the group thanked first responders and safety teams.",
      "\u201cAnd to the protester we lost, we will not forget you,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The national chapter of 50501 said in a statement posted to social media that a \u201clocal volunteer\u201d fired the three rounds that killed Ah Loo. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre\u2019s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What\u2019s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "The Mona Lisa\u2019s daily mob",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff planned to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "A museum in limbo",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks."

      "As Senate Republicans release key details of President Donald Trump\u2019s spending package, some provisions, including the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, remain in limbo.",
      "Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there\u2019s currently a $10,000 limit on the SALT deduction through 2025. Before 2018, the tax break \u2014 including state and local income and property taxes \u2014 was unlimited for filers who itemized deductions. But the so-called alternative minimum tax reduced the benefit for some higher earners.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee\u2019s proposed text released on Monday includes a $10,000 SALT deduction cap, which is expected to change during Senate-House negotiations on the spending package. That limit is down from the $40,000 cap approved by House Republicans in May.",
      "The SALT deduction has been 'contentious'",
      "\u201cSALT has been contentious for eight years,\u201d said Andrew Lautz, associate director for the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s economic policy program.",
      "Since 2017, the SALT deduction cap has been a key issue for certain lawmakers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. These House members have leverage during negotiations amid a slim House Republican majority.",
      "Under current law, filers who itemize tax breaks can\u2019t claim more than $10,000 for the SALT deduction, including married couples filing jointly, which is considered a \u201cmarriage penalty.\u201d",
      "However, raising the SALT deduction cap has been controversial. If enacted, benefits would primarily flow to higher-income households, according to a May analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "Currently, the vast majority of filers \u2014 roughly 90%, according to the latest IRS data \u2014 use the standard deduction and don\u2019t benefit from itemized tax breaks.",
      "Plus, the 2017 SALT cap was enacted to help pay for other TCJA tax breaks, and some lawmakers support the lower limit for funding purposes.",
      "In the Senate, \u201cthere isn\u2019t a high level of interest in doing anything on SALT,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said June 15 on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think at the end of the day, we\u2019ll find a landing spot, hopefully that will get the votes that we need in the House, a compromise position on the SALT issue,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "It took 11 years since Facebook acquired it for $19 billion, but Meta is finally bringing ads to WhatsApp, marking a major change for an app whose founders shunned advertising.",
      "Meta announced Monday that businesses will now be able to run so-called status ads on WhatsApp that prompt users to interact with the advertisers via the app\u2019s messaging features. The ads will only be shown to users within WhatsApp\u2019s \u201cUpdates\u201d tab to separate the promotions from people\u2019s personal conversations. Additionally, Meta will begin monetizing WhatsApp\u2019s Channels feature through search ads and subscriptions.",
      "The debut of ads on the messaging app represents a significant step in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s plans to make WhatsApp \u201cthe next chapter\u201d in his company\u2019s history, as he told CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer in 2022. The move to monetize WhatsApp also comes amid Meta\u2019s high-profile antitrust case with the Federal Trade Commission over the company\u2019s blockbuster acquisitions of the messaging app and Instagram.",
      "Already, Meta allows advertisers to run so-called click-to-message ads on Facebook and Instagram that steer users to WhatsApp where they can directly engage with businesses. Messaging between brands and consumers \u201cshould be the next pillar of our business,\u201d Zuckerberg told analysts in April, adding that WhatsApp now has over 3 billion monthly users, including \u201cmore than 100 million people in the U.S. and growing quickly there.\u201d",
      "Now, companies can run those kinds of ads within WhatsApp itself. The new status ads appear in a user\u2019s Updates tab within that tab\u2019s \u201cStatus\u201d feature that can be used to share pictures, videos and text that vanish after 24 hours, akin to Instagram Stories.",
      "Since Meta bought WhatsApp in 2014, the popular messaging app has continued to grow worldwide. But unlike Facebook, Instagram and most recently Threads, WhatsApp has never allowed advertising.",
      "WhatsApp\u2019s co-founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, were public in their scorn for the advertising industry, and the duo left Facebook after reportedly clashing with executives who were eager to inject the app with advertising and other practices they shunned.",
      "The social media company does not reveal WhatsApp\u2019s specific sales, but analysts have previously estimated the app\u2019s revenue to be between $500 million and $1 billion from charging businesses for tools and services so they can message customers on the app.",
      "Meta will \u201cuse very basic information\u201d to recommend which ads to show WhatsApp users, Nikila Srinivasan, Meta\u2019s head of product for business messaging, said Friday. This includes a person\u2019s country, city, device, language and data like who they follow or how they interact with ads.",
      "The company debuted WhatsApp\u2019s Updates tab in June 2023 along with an accompanying Channels feature that allows people and organizations to send broadcast messages and updates to their followers as opposed to personal conversations. Meta will also monetize the Channels feature, the company said Monday.",
      "Organizations and people who are Channel administrators will now be able to spend money to boost the visibility of their respective Channels when a person searches for them via a directory, similar to ads on Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores.",
      "Additionally, channel administrators will be able to charge users monthly subscription fees to access exclusive updates and content, Meta said Monday. The company will not immediately make money from those monthly subscription fees, but it plans to eventually take a 10% cut of those subscriptions, a spokesperson said.",
      "Meta hopes that by limiting its new ads to WhatsApp\u2019s Updates tab it will disrupt users as little as possible, Srinivasan said. Users\u2019 status updates as well as personal messages and calls on WhatsApp will remain encrypted, she said.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that the Updates tab is the right place for these new features,\u201d Srinivasan said.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee released their portion of the massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda on Monday, with some significant changes compared with the House-passed package.",
      "The 549-page bill extends the expiring Trump tax cuts and includes provisions to slash taxes on tips and overtime pay.",
      "It contains a slew of Medicaid spending cuts and new rules, including work requirements that would kick in at the end of 2026, like the House bill. It also contains policies to force more frequent checks on eligibility and tougher screenings to prove lawful immigration status, in order for people to keep their coverage.",
      "Another Medicaid change is more aggressive than the House bill.",
      "\u201cThe House bill placed a moratorium on taxes on providers that help states fund their Medicaid programs and increase payments to providers for services they provide. The Senate bill goes further, limiting the provider taxes that many states already have in place, but only in states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA,\u201d said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a research group. \u201cThere were expectations that the Senate might moderate the Medicaid cuts passed by the House, but if anything they\u2019re doubling down.\u201d",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has been critical of that idea, saying it could hurt rural hospitals in his state. \u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d he said when asked about the Senate provision. \u201cIt sounds to me like this needs some work.\u201d",
      "In a major challenge to House Republicans, the Senate bill caps federal deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000 per tax filer, preserving the status quo on \u201cSALT.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s much lower than the $40,000 limit per filers with annual incomes under $500,000 that a key group of blue-state Republicans secured in the House version, after making clear it is essential to winning their vote in the narrowly divided chamber.",
      "\u201cEvidently, we\u2019re just putting down a marker for negotiation,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who added that he hopes the House-Senate SALT compromise will be a $20,000 cap.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., slammed the $10,000 cap on X, calling it \u201cDEAD ON ARRIVAL.\u201d",
      "The Senate\u2019s bill also includes changes to Medicare including new eligibility rules, including verification of citizenship or lawful permanent residency for older adults to keep getting benefits.",
      "Another provision that's also in the House bill would adjust cost-sharing rules for \u201cdual eligibles\u201d on both Medicare and Medicaid. Loren Adler, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institution, said that provision \u201cmeans 1.3 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries see higher premiums and/or cost-sharing, no longer receiving financial assistance they\u2019re eligible for,\u201d citing an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",

      "The Senate bill also swiftly repeals clean energy funding passed by a Democratic-led Congress in 2022, including an electric vehicle tax credit, while tilting the playing field back toward fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cI look forward to continued coordination with our colleagues in the House and the Administration to deliver President Trump\u2019s bold economic agenda for the American people as quickly as possible,\u201d Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in a statement.",

      "President Donald Trump signed an agreement Monday formally lowering some tariffs on imports from the United Kingdom as the countries continue working toward a formal trade deal.",
      "Trump lowered tariffs on the U.K. aerospace sector to zero, which will take effect by the end of the month according to the U.K. Department for Business and Trade. The document also lowers tariffs on U.K. auto imports to 10% on the first 100,000 vehicles, according to the White House. Previously vehicles imported from Great Britain faced a 27.5% duty.",
      "However, the agreement does not lower steel tariffs to zero as the two leaders agreed in May. \"As the Prime Minister and President Trump have again confirmed, we will continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products,\" the U.K. government said in a statement. In the meantime, imports of U.K. steel products will continue to face a 25% duty.",
      "\"This now implements on car tariffs and aerospace. It's a really important agreement, and so this is very good day for both of our countries,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.",
      "Trump said alongside him: \"It's a fair deal for both, and it's going to produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income. And we have many, many others coming.\"",
      "The original agreement with the U.K. announced last month is so far the only trade deal Trump has reached since he slapped every U.S. trading partner with a dizzying array of tariffs on April 2. He paused implementing those tariffs for 90 days after the announcement rocked global markets.",
      "Monday's agreement also implements \"reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes beef for both US and British farmers,\" the U.K. said.",
      "While the U.K. just makes it into the top 10 of America\u2019s trading partners, the deal is critical for Starmer, who revealed in an impromptu visit to a Jaguar Land Rover factory in England last month.",
      "Starmer and his Labour government are pushing to grow the U.K. economy, which contracted in April amid a record fall in exports to the United States.",
      "Starmer\u2019s government also had to partly nationalize the last major steel plant in the U.K. as the industry increasingly moves abroad, primarily to Asia.",
      "For Trump\u2019s part, his government has repeatedly promised to sign \u201c90 deals in 90 days.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--,\u201d he said in April before his reciprocal tariffs were due to go into effect. \u201cThey are dying to make a deal. \u2018Please, please, sir, make a deal. I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll do anything, sir!\u2019\u201d",
      "With 68 days having elapsed since Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day tariffs were paused, the U.K. deal remains the only deal on paper, but it has not been formally implemented in full.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have held at least six days of meetings with China on two occasions but have not reached any type of deal.",
      "Likewise with the European Union, America\u2019s largest trading partner, Greer has held talks with its trade chief a handful of times, but there is still no deal in sight for the 27-nation bloc.",
      "Japan\u2019s economic minister has also met with the three U.S. officials multiple times, including for 70 minutes Sunday. However, Japan is still working to reach a formal deal with the United States.",
      "Recently, as he appeared to grow irritated with repeated questions about the lack of trade deals, Trump began saying the United States would start \u201csending letters out\u201d telling countries \u201cwhat the deal is,\u201d rather than negotiating one.",
      "\u201cWe have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal. But you\u2019re not able to see that many countries,\u201d Trump said in early May. \u201cSo at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out.\u201d",

      "The Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not say why. Relatives told The Salt Lake City Tribune the deputy claimed she was driving too close to a semi-truck.",
      "The stop lasted less than 20 minutes, and \"Dias Goncalves was released from the traffic stop with a warning,\" the sheriff\u2019s office said in a news release Monday.",
      "Then, shortly after she exited the highway, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stopped her, arrested her and took her to an immigration detention center.",
      "\"She has no criminal record and she was not shown a warrant,\" her attorney, Jon Hyman, said in an email.",

      "Friends and relatives question how immigration authorities were alerted to her location.",
      "As part of an ongoing \"full administrative review,\" the Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Office determined that the deputy who stopped Dias Goncalves was part of a communication group that included local, state and federal law enforcement partners participating in \"a multi-agency drug interdiction effort focusing on the highways throughout Western Colorado.\"",
      "\"We were unaware that the communication group was used for anything other than drug interdiction efforts, including immigration,\" the sheriff's office said. \"We have since removed all Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Office members from the communication group.\"",

      "Wood joined Jim Ehrler of Texas in 1950 and Jim Wixson of Oklahoma State in 1960 as the only pitchers to throw CWS no-hitters, and his defense was never really challenged as he dominated a Racers team that was making its first Omaha appearance.",
      "The junior right-hander set the CWS record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game. His bid for a perfect game ended in the eighth when his 2-2 breaking ball hit Dom Decker in his back foot. Wood, who got a foul out and consecutive strikeouts to end the inning, looked skyward and gave a primal scream and did a couple of high steps as he headed to the dugout.",

      "The closest Murray State came to breaking up Wood\u2019s no-hitter was Carson Garner\u2019s hot grounder that pulled first baseman Reese Robinett to his left. Robinett snagged the ball and touched the bag for the last out of the seventh inning.",
      "Wood showed early signs that this could be a special day. He had excellent command of his signature four-seam fastball, breaking ball and changeup. Of his first 20 fastballs, 19 were strikes, and he fanned nine of the first 12 batters he faced \u2014 seven in a row from the third to fifth innings.",
      "Wood has gone from closer as a freshman to middle reliever as a sophomore to weekend starter as a junior. He injured his right shoulder throwing a warmup pitch in his Feb. 23 start against Michigan and didn\u2019t return until April 18 against Texas A&M, a total of 54 days.",
      "He threw a career-long six innings and struck out a career-high 13 against Creighton in a June 1 regional game against Creighton, then went 3 1/3 innings in a super regional win over Tennessee on June 8.",

    "summary": "Sabrina Carpenter's new album cover for her next project, \"Man's Best Friend\" is causing a lot of confusion amongst fans.",
    "story": [
      "What message is the cover art for Sabrina Carpenter's upcoming album, \"Man's Best Friend,\" sending, both artistically and for her brand?",
      "The singer's fans have been asking themselves just that since the art was released June 11, sparking conversation and controversy.",
      "Carpenter even replied to a person who questioned her personality and cover art choices.",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is the first follow-up to Carpenter's 2024 album \"Short 'n' Sweet\" that launched her to new heights of fame with songs like \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "What is the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "The cover art is immediately provocative. In the photo, Carpenter kneels on all fours wearing a tight black dress. Her hand rests on a man's leg. His hand, meanwhile, holds a chunk of her blond hair. Carpenter stares at the camera with an open-mouthed expression.",
      "On Instagram, Carpenter shared another image: A closeup of a dog wearing a collar with the words \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "She captioned the post, \"My new album, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend' \ud83d\udc3e is out on August 29, 2025. I can\u2019t wait for it to be yours x Pre-order now.\"",
      "What are fans saying about the art?",
      "The art has gotten mixed reactions from fans, as evidenced by the comments on the original post and multiple Reddit threads.",
      "In the comments of Carpenter's post, people used words like \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the imagery, saying it was \"not a very empowering image for women.\" Another told her to \"please please please stand UP.\"",
      "Others tried to read into the image's connection to the album's title and found a deeper meaning.",
      "\"Man\u2019s best friend double meaning for dogs and female dogs are b---hes so it\u2019s a play on the ideology of men being so dependent on women,\" one commenter said. \"Her cover shows her being in a submissive role but in reality she\u2019s the one who has actual control.\"",
      "Commenters debated back-and-forth. One said they were getting \"secondhand embarrassment\" by looking at the picture. Another responded, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to embarrass women but rather to show how women are regarded by certain men.\"",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Carpenter's reps for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "What is Sabrina Carpenter trying to say? A PR expert breaks it down",
      "Beth Booker, public perception expert and creator of \"The Uncensored Publicist,\" says the artwork should be situated within Carpenter's own brand and the way female pop stars are often marketed.",
      "The image is a familiar one at first: A \u201cfemale pop star posed and packaged perfectly for the male gaze,\" Booker says, comparing it to Britney Spears in the early 2000s or Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" era.",
      "However, Booker sees this as Carpenter \"flipping the script\" on a familiar format. Since humor is such a \"huge part of her brand,\" she says this should be interpreted with a wink.",
      "\"The cover is hypersexualized, yes, but intentionally exaggerated to feel almost absurd,\" she says. \"She\u2019s sexy, but she\u2019s also funny, self-aware, and in complete control of how she\u2019s being seen.\"",
      "Booker says that Carpenter's submissive posture in the photo is not an indication she's like that in real life.",
      "\"She\u2019s not performing desire for someone else\u2019s approval, she\u2019s expressing it for herself and her audience. The title, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend,' directly nods to how women have been labeled 'b-----s' for decades and she\u2019s essentially saying: fine, I\u2019ll take the word, flip it, and turn it into part of my brand,\" Booker says.",
      "Fans are debating Carpenter's intentions, which Booker says may have been Carpenter's intention.",
      "\"That confusion is the point. Great pop culture lives in that gray area where people aren\u2019t quite sure how they\u2019re supposed to feel. Is it satire? Is it sexy? The answer is yes. She knows exactly how this image would land and she\u2019s allowing people to sit in that tension because that\u2019s what keeps the conversation going. She\u2019s not being provocative accidentally, she\u2019s doing it on her own terms,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some people, even some of her own fans, are uncomfortable with it actually reinforces the point. Brand evolution doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable in real time, and that\u2019s part of what makes this moment important for her career.\u201d",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is Carpenter's seventh studio album and it'll follow the release of \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her sixth studio album, which won pop album of the year at the 2025 Grammys.",
      "What did Sabrina Carpenter say about the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "Days after Carpenter unveiled the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend,\" her upcoming album, she replied to someone questioning the photo.",
      "A X user commented, \u201cDoes she have a personality outside of sex?\u201d reposting the cover art.",
      "On June 16, Carpenter commented, \u201cgirl yes and it is goooooood.\u201d"

      "\u201cI go on and off the rails with healthy eating and stuff. But what\u2019s really good is that with her, we\u2019re so conscious, my wife and I, about feeding her healthy, nutritious meals,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cWhich makes me remind myself again about being healthy.\u201d",
      "Wilson explains that while she herself would \u201coften eat a lot of junk food,\u201d parents would \u201cnever deliberately feed your child rubbish.\u201d And avoiding feeding her child \"rubbish\" is a good way to keep her own health goals on track.",

      "\u201cI was sitting down with her and I was playing with this kind of sand \u2014 it\u2019s like magnetic sand or something. I mean, just sitting there, just playing and talking to each other and just being present and not worrying about anything else,\u201d she recalls.",

      "\u201cIt just really changed my life. I mean, I don\u2019t have much of a social life,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cMy spare time goes to my wife and daughter, and so I\u2019m not gallivanting around like I used to be as a single lady, but it\u2019s just so fun.\u201d",
      "Wilson continued, \u201cI feel so settled and nice and like everything\u2019s going great. And I think just, women in their 40s anyway, you just find a nice groove and a nice place of comfortability where you are, which is great.\u201d",
      "The \u201cBride Hard\u201d star married Agruma in a ceremony in September 2024 in Sardinia, Italy. Wilson\u2019s daughter, Royce, was born via surrogate on Nov. 7, 2022."

      "Ironically, the actor was never supposed to stay at \u201cY&R\u201d very long. But as he settled into the temporary role, fans grew to love Victor, and Braeden was offered a long-term contract.",
      "The only problem? Braeden wasn't sold on the character. So he spoke to his wife, who encouraged him to look at the role as a challenge. Then, he sat down with Bill Bell, the co-creator of \"Y&R.\"",
      "\"I said, 'Bill, I\u2019m tired of playing only bad guys. I\u2019ve done that for so many years, on nighttime television, films.' I said, 'Can we attribute a background to this character that explains why he is who he is?' Because we all are formed by it. And he came up with the storyline where I tell Nikki (Newman) that I grew up in an orphanage. I then knew I would stay,\" he recalls.",
      "Braeden's character has been at the center of a plethora of captivating storylines over the years, but he's particularly fond of one that featured Dorothy McGuire and George Kennedy playing his on-screen mother and father.",
      "\"All of that creates the bedrock for what Victor Newman became, and that was the brilliance of Bill Bell, who came up with that storyline,\" Braeden says. \"Those are by far, hands down, the most seminal scenes I\u2019ve done in the show explaining who Victor Newman is.\"",
      "Victor has had many romantic interests over the course of 45 years, but none compare to his epic love story with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).",
      "\"The reason Mel and I have been doing it so long is because she gets me. Mel knows how to deal with me. ... And I with her,\" he says while complimenting his \"clever\" and talented co-star.",
      "As the head of Newman Enterprises, Victor is known as a master manipulator in the world of business. But in real life, Braeden says he doesn't possess the same penchant for corporate subterfuge.",
      "\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t do anything that Victor does. I\u2019m not a business guy,\u201d he says, noting that he does have a few things in common with his character.",
      "For instance, Victor never shies away from a fight, and Braeden shares the same signature tenacity.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to confrontation, I don\u2019t back down. I don\u2019t give a f--- who it is. I don\u2019t back down. And that has been the case with me since I was a young boy,\u201d he says.",
      "Victor is known for meddling in his family\u2019s affairs, especially their romantic escapades. But Braeden takes a more even-keeled approach.",
      "\"I love my family and would never dictate to my family,\" he says.",
      "Speaking of family, Braeden lights up when I bring up his son, Christian Gudegast, whom he refers to as his \u201cgreatest accomplishment\u201d in his book, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Damned.\u201d",
      "In a way, Gudegast has followed in his father's footsteps, pursuing a career as a writer and director.",
      "\"I always sort of wanted him to become an actor. And only about half a year ago, he told me why he didn\u2019t want it. Because he saw me at certain times in my life very upset about not getting this or that role,\u201d he explains.",
      "Braeden sent his son to acting school to give him a solid foundation as a director and has supported his dreams ever since.",
      "Braeden's passion for his craft is evident as he recounts his iconic career. Although he had many notable acting credits to his name before joining the cast of \"Y&R,\" he tells me that the soap opera taught him something invaluable about the significance of an actor's work.",
      "\u201cOne of the most profound meanings is to entertain people. I learned that here in this medium and I\u2019m very grateful,\" he says. \"I\u2019m very grateful to fans for that reason because they taught me what this is about \u2014 entertainment,\" he says.",
      "While talking about the volume of work he and his colleagues produce on a weekly basis, the soap opera veteran's pride is evident.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s the toughest medium there is in Hollywood. I\u2019ve done it all,\" he says. \"For writers, this is the hardest job in all of Hollywood, writing for a soap. As an actor, it is equally much the hardest job there is.\"",
      "Braeden goes on to describe just how much work goes into filming a soap opera.",
      "\"In film, we do two or three pages a day,\" he explains.",
      "On the opposite end of the spectrum, Braeden says soap operas typically shoot 100 pages of dialogue a day. As a main star of the show, he's certainly in demand and has a record of shooting 62 pages of dialogue in one day.",
      "I get to witness Braeden in action filming scenes for an upcoming episode, and it's easy to see why he's so respected by his colleagues.",
      "The industry veteran handles his lines with ease and also imbues a sense of fun into his work, chatting animatedly with his co-stars and the crew.",
      "While reading Braeden's autobiography, I was intrigued by a passage where he discusses a quote from playwright and screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who defined happiness as \"insensitivity.\"",
      "After losing his father at the age of 12 and navigating poverty at a young age, I'm curious to know if Braeden's worldview was shaped by these formative experiences and how he himself defines happiness.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in and of itself. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s b-------.  (Happiness is) in the doing, and it\u2019s in the few moments after the doing that you feel, \u2018Well, I accomplished something. Great.\u2019 That\u2019s it. A few minutes afterwards, then you\u2019ve got to plan another thing to do. There\u2019s no permanent happiness state,\u201d he explains.",
      "The answer is consistent with the way Braeden has progressed in his career: constantly on the move, consistently challenging himself.",
      "The actor shows no signs of slowing down, and I can't help but selfishly wonder if he will ever leave \"Y&R\" to enjoy a proper retirement. Luckily for me and countless other fans, he has no plans of stepping away from his career anytime soon.",
      "\u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing. I love doing it. I don\u2019t know why, but I do,\u201d he says."

      "Prince Louis had all eyes on him \u2014 again \u2014 at the 2025 Trooping the Colour birthday celebration for his granddad, King Charles III.",
      "The puckish 7-year-old royal, who's become known for his antics at royal appearances, appeared alongside his siblings, Prince George, 11, and Princess Charlotte, 10, and their parents, William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales outside Buckingham Palace during the annual festivities.",
      "Similar to previous years, Prince Louis shared some candid reactions as he made his way to Buckingham Palace with his family. But this time around, his big brother, Prince George, joined in on his revelry as they both appeared to be having a bit of fun as they sat alongside their mom, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and their sister Princess Charlotte.",
      "Prince George appeared to be enjoying the carriage ride with his family during the Trooping the Colour ceremony at the Horse Guards Parade. He was captured joining in on his brother's silly antics by saying what appeared to be a silent prayer. From the side profile, their mom, Princess Catherine, appeared to smiling and perhaps laughing at their fun brotherly moment.",
      "This isn't the first time Prince Louis has charmed onlookers at Trooping the Colour. In 2023, Louis hammed it up as he made a series of adorable faces and held up his fists to imitate a pilot during the celebratory fly-past of about 70 military aircraft and helicopters.",
      "Just last month, the impish prince stole the show again at a May 5 military parade honoring the 80th anniversary of V-E Day in Britain, which marked the end of World War II in Europe.",
      "Louis took time out from the parade to brush off the shoulder of the military uniform worn by his dad, who was sitting alongside him.",
      "He also stuck out his tongue and pouted at other points during the celebration and was even caught rolling his eyes.",
      "The icing on the cake was when Louis mimicked his big brother, George. After George absent-mindedly flipped his hair back, Louis followed by performing a cheeky impression of him."

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced Friday.",
      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre\u2019s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What\u2019s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "The Mona Lisa\u2019s daily mob",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff planned to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "A museum in limbo",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks."

      "As Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, prepare for a lavish, star-studded wedding in Venice, not everyone in the Italian city is happy about the impending nuptials.",
      "\"No space for Bezos,\" a sign read at a protest by residents who say the famed canal city is already overrun by tourists, billionaires or otherwise.",
      "Protesters say their issue is with the happy couple and authorities, like Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro, who said he was \"ashamed\" by the protests.",
      "\"We want to send a very clear message: The ones who should be ashamed are them,\" protester Federica Toninello told Reuters. \"They are the people who have destroyed this city.\"",
      "Venice\u2019s 2-square-mile main island and historic center, home to about 50,000 people, receives about 20 million visitors yearly, mostly day-trippers from cruise ships or other cities. While tourism is central to Venice\u2019s economy and cultural identity, critics say it has displaced residents and damaged historic sites.",
      "Venetians\u2019 wedding wariness comes as demonstrators across southern Europe rallied over the weekend against mass tourism. Residents protested on the Spanish island of Mallorca and in Spanish cities such as Barcelona \u2014 where tourists were spritzed with water guns \u2014 as well as in Venice and Lisbon, the capital of Portugal."

      "Malik Tillman scored twice and Diego Luna had a pair of assists in a 5-0 rout of Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday in the Americans' CONCACAF Gold Cup opener.",
      "\"Really important I think to cut a little bit this \u2014 I don't say negativity, but, yes ... but it's really important now to start the competition with a good feeling,\" U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said.",
      "Victory in the Group D opener ended a four-game losing streak and came after days of controversy over Christian Pulisic's desire to rest during the Gold Cup and Pochettino not including the star in a pair of pre-tournament friendlies the attacker offered to play in.",

      "\"It was in our hands to show a reaction and I think we've done it today,\" Tillman said. \"We played a good game and it was nice to bounce back, have a good start to the tournament.\"",
      "Brenden Aaronson added his ninth goal in the 82nd and Haji Wright his fifth just 1 minute, 13 seconds later for the 16th-ranked Americans, who drew just 12,610 to PayPal Park.",
      "\"Malik is a talented player. It's obvious that everyone can see,\" Pochettino said. \"October, November, when we met for the first time I think it was difficult to create this relationship that the player need(s) and the coach need(s) to trust and to trust each other. ... I think now after a few weeks together I really start to understand him and he starts to understand us. And he's very special, a very special talent and a very special kid.\"",
      "Luna, a 21-year-old who impressed Pochettino during his debut in January when he insisted he stay on the field with a broken nose, was playing not far from where he grew up and said he had gotten tickets for about 30 family and friends.",
      "\"Just an honor, right, to be able to dream about this day,\" he said. \"(To) start off a tournament like this back in my home city is awesome.\"",
      "Luna ran onto Jones' back pass, dribbled down the left flank and crossed to Tillman for the second goal, then shot from just inside the penalty area for the goal that glanced off Tillman for a 3-0 lead.",
      "\"His performance was really good. He showed his character,\" Pochettino said.",
      "The Americans have won their group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, along with a second-place finish behind Panama in 2011, and improved their group stage record to 41 wins, one loss and five draws. They play invited guest Saudi Arabia on Thursday at Austin, Texas, then close group play on June 22 against Haiti at Arlington, Texas.",
      "Matt Freese was in goal in place of Matt Turner, who had started 14 consecutive competitive matches for the U.S. and 23 of 24 dating to the 2022 World Cup. The lone exception was a Gold Cup group stage game against St. Kitts and Nevis in 2023.",
      "Pochettino said he wanted to create competition for Turner, who didn't get into a Crystal Palace match after March 1. The coach said Turner told him he was disappointed with the decision but understood it and would compete to get playing time."

      "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 Britain\u2019s real-life spies have finally caught up with James Bond. MI6 has appointed its first female chief.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \u201cI am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\u201d",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2014 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2014 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller from 2002 to 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women\u2019s rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-went-opposing-israels-strikes-iran-reluctant-support-rcna213091",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump had opposed Israeli action against Iran, but came to believe Israel had reason to act and that the U.S. would have to lend some support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

      "Medics at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in central Gaza areas, where most of the casualties were moved to, said at least 15 people were killed as they tried to approach the GHF aid distribution site near the Netzarim corridor.",
      "The rest were killed in separate attacks across the enclave, they added. There has been no immediate comment by the Israeli military or the GHF on Saturday\u2019s incidents.",
      "The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, overseeing a new model of aid distribution which the United Nations says is neither impartial nor neutral.",
      "The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.",
      "Later on Saturday, the Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards the so-called humanitarian zone area, saying it would forcefully work against \u201cterror organizations\u201d in the area.",
      "The war in Gaza erupted 20 months ago after Hamas-led militants raided Israel and took 251 hostages and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, on October 7, 2023, Israel\u2019s single deadliest day.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign since has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip, which is home to more than two million people. Most of the population is displaced, and malnutrition is widespread.",
      "Despite efforts by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to restore a ceasefire in Gaza, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal."

      "Search and recovery teams continued scouring the site of one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters for a third day after the Air India flight fell from the sky and killed at least 270 people in Gujarat state, officials said Saturday.",
      "The London-bound Boeing 787 struck a medical college hostel in a residential area of the northwestern city of Ahmedabad minutes after takeoff Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. One passenger survived.",
      "Recovery teams working until late Friday found at least 25 more bodies in the debris, officials said.",
      "Dr. Dhaval Gameti at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad told The Associated Press the facility had received 270 bodies, adding that the lone surviving passenger was still under observation for some of his wounds.",
      "\u201cHe is doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon,\u201d Gameti said Saturday.",
      "Hundreds of relatives of the crash victims have provided DNA samples at the hospital. Most bodies were charred or mutilated, making them unrecognizable.",
      "Some relatives expressed frustration Saturday that the process was taking too long. Authorities say it normally takes up to 72 hours to complete DNA matching and they are expediting the process.",
      "\u201cWhere are my children? Did you recover them?\u201d asked Rafiq Abdullah, whose nephew, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. \u201cI will have to ask questions. Government is not answering these questions.\u201d",
      "Another relative persistently asked hospital staff when his relative\u2019s body would be handed over to the family for last rites.",
      "\u201cGive us the body,\u201d the relative insisted.",
      "Alongside the formal investigation, the Indian government says it has formed a high-level, multi-disciplinary committee to examine the causes leading to the crash.",
      "The committee will focus on formulating procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future and \u201cwill not be a substitute to other enquiries being conducted by relevant organizations,\u201d the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement.",
      "Authorities have begun inspecting Air India\u2019s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Indian Minister of Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said Saturday in New Delhi at his first news briefing since Thursday\u2019s crash.",
      "Eight of the 34 Dreamliner aircraft in India have already undergone inspection, Kinjarapu said, adding that the remaining aircraft will be examined with \u201cimmediate urgency.\u201d",
      "The government is eagerly awaiting results of the crash investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and all necessary steps will be taken without hesitation, Kinjarapu said.",
      "Investigators on Friday recovered the plane\u2019s digital flight data recorder, or the black box, which was recovered from a rooftop near the crash site and likely will lead to clues about the cause of the accident.",
      "India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said it had started working with \u201cfull force\u201d to extract the data.",
      "The device is expected to reveal information about the engine and control settings, while the voice recorder will provide cockpit conversations, said Paul Fromme, a mechanical engineer with the U.K.-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",
      "Aviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti, a former crash investigator for both the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, said investigators should be able to answer some important questions about what caused the crash as soon as next week as long as the flight data recorder is in good shape.",
      "Investigators likely are looking at whether wing flaps were set correctly, the engine lost power, alarms were going off inside the cockpit and if the plane\u2019s crew correctly logged information about the hot temperature outside and the weight of the fuel and passengers, Guzzetti said.",
      "Mistakes in the data could result in the wing flaps being set incorrectly, he said.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.",
      "There are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts."

    "summary": "Israeli strikes leave Iran's wounded government facing a number of questions, including whether it should give up on negotiations and rush its nuclear program.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s military strikes on Iran have struck at the heart of the country\u2019s military leadership and nuclear program, creating a possible vacuum at the top of the regime that could hinder its ability to recover from the onslaught, experts say.",
      "But \u2014 assuming that it still can \u2014 there is a scenario in which the strikes could lead Tehran to abandon negotiations over its nuclear program and instead rush toward building a bomb, according to analysts and former U.S. officials.",
      "The killing of top Iranian military officers as well as several nuclear scientists will likely have sparked fears in Tehran that Israeli intelligence had deeply penetrated the regime and that other senior figures could also be in danger.",
      "Israel has previously pulled off brazen assassinations inside Iran, targeting senior government scientists involved in the country\u2019s nuclear program and the political leader of the Iranian-backed Palestinian group Hamas when he was visiting Tehran.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume the system is shell-shocked,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t know\u2026 how badly they\u2019re infiltrated\u201d by Israel.",
      "Iranian media and the Israeli military said Israel\u2019s strikes on Thursday killed Iran\u2019s top military officer, Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, as well as the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, and a major general in the Revolutionary Guards, Gholam Ali Rashid.",
      "The senior military officers targeted had deep ties to Iran\u2019s regime and were known personally by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, particularly Bagheri, according to Vatanka. Khamenei promoted Bagheri to his post as chief of the armed forces in 2016.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a personal element here, which might be a factor in terms of what Khamenei decides to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Shahid Beheshti University said five professors were killed in Thursday\u2019s attack as well as \u201csome\u201d family members.",
      "Nuclear program\u2019s future",
      "The first wave of Israeli military strikes launched Thursday likely inflicted serious damage on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that air raids will continue for \u201cas many days as it takes\u201d to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear arsenal.",
      "But Iran still has buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and elsewhere that it could potentially use if it chose to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and rescind its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. In that case, Iran would need to enrich uranium to weapon-grade levels, a short technical step with its current stockpile, and then build a nuclear warhead. That effort could take roughly a year or more, most experts estimate.",
      "The CIA declined to comment as to whether there were any indications that Iran was moving to pull out of the NPT and pursue nuclear weapons.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be trying to use the Israeli military attack as leverage over Iran, pushing it to make concessions or else face even harsher military strikes. But Iran may calculate that the time for negotiations is over and opt to build nuclear weapons, according to Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\u201cOne of the strategic risks in targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure is the potential for backlash,\u201d Vaez said. The strikes \u201ccould incentivize Tehran to reconstitute its program with renewed urgency, driven by a heightened resolve to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran has invested decades of effort and trillions of dollars in building its nuclear program, and Iranian political leaders portray it as a point of national pride, a symbol of the country\u2019s independence and technological progress.",
      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."

      "The Israeli military launched a massive attack on Iran on Friday in a dramatic escalation of their long-running conflict that drew a retaliatory missile assault from Tehran and raised the risk of another war in the Middle East.",
      "The Israeli strikes took out a significant swath of Iran's top military leaders and senior scientists, as Israel unleashed more than 200 fighter jets across roughly 100 targets. They were aimed at Iran\u2019s main enrichment facility and targets associated with the country\u2019s ballistic missile program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.",
      "In a firm response Friday evening local time, Iran launched missiles toward Israel, the nation\u2019s defense forces said, prompting its highly sophisticated defense systems to \"intercept the threat.\"",
      "Heavy smoke appeared in the night sky over Tel Aviv as incoming rockets from Iran descended on the city, with many intercepted by Israel\u2019s missile defense systems. Before the retaliatory attack began, the Israel Defense Forces directed residents across the country to remain close to protected spaces, minimize movement in public areas and avoid public gatherings.",
      "Police officers and bomb disposal experts responded to reports of fallen projectile debris, according to the Israeli Police, which advised people to report \u201csuspicious findings\u201d to an emergency hotline.",
      "Israel's emergency service, Magen David Adom, said it was providing medical treatment to 34 injured people following a rocket strike in Israel's central region.",
      "The Israeli paramedic organization also said it was providing treatment and evacuating at least 21 people after a strike south of Tel Aviv.",

      "Loud explosions in Iran were heard in the northern part of the capital on Friday night, while state media reported attacks in Qom, located south of Tehran and a holy city for Shia Muslims. Fars reported on X that explosions could be heard in the area of the heavily fortified nuclear site of Fordow, which is located deep underground near Qom.",

      "Shares of U.S. Steel rose 3.5% on the news in after-the-bell trading as investors bet the deal was close to done. Trump, in an executive order, said conditions for resolving the national security concerns would be laid out in an agreement, without providing details. \u201cI additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met,\u201d Trump said in the order, which was released by the White House.",
      "The companies thanked Trump in a news release, saying the agreement includes $11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028 and governance commitments including a golden share to be issued to the U.S. government. They did not detail how much control the golden share would give the U.S. Shares of U.S. Steel had dipped earlier on Friday after a Nippon Steel executive told the Japanese Nikkei newspaper that its planned takeover of U.S. Steel required \u201ca degree of management freedom\u201d to go ahead after Trump earlier had said the U.S. would be in control with a golden share.",
      "The bid, first announced by Nippon Steel in December 2023, has faced opposition from the start. Both Democratic former President Joe Biden and Trump, a Republican, asserted last year that U.S. Steel should remain U.S.-owned, as they sought to woo voters ahead of the presidential election in Pennsylvania, where the company is headquartered.",
      "Biden in January, shortly before leaving office, blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.",
      "The steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which began on January 20 and opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.",

But he later told reporters the deal still lacked his final approval, leaving unresolved whether he would allow Nippon Steel to take ownership.",
      "Nippon Steel and the Trump administration asked a U.S. appeals court on June 5 for an eight-day extension of a pause in litigation to give them more time to reach a deal for the Japanese firm. The pause expires Friday, but could be extended.",

      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",

      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",

      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",

      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"
