      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is starting the new year with her first Instagram account since 2020.",
      "The Associated Press confirmed Wednesday that @meghan belongs to the Duchess of Sussex. Her first post is a black and white video of herself at the beach, wearing white and drawing 2025 in the sand on an overcast day. The account already has more than 200,000 followers.",
      "Meghan and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, were married in 2018, and were initially part of @KensingtonRoyal, which also included Harry's brother, Prince William, and his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales. But a year later, Meghan and Harry launched their own account, @SussexRoyal, a sign of their growing distance from the royal family. @SussexRoyal was discontinued in 2020, around the time that Meghan and Harry announced they were stepping back from their official roles.",
      "Meghan, who had a popular Instagram account when she was best known for her role in \u201cSuits,\u201d had indicated she would return. In a 2022 interview with New York Magazine's The Cut, she confided: \u201cDo you want to know a secret? I\u2019m getting back \u2026 on Instagram.\"",
      "At other times, she sounded reluctant to return to Instagram, citing concerns about harassment. In 2023, Meghan and Harry urged social media platforms to strengthen content-moderation policies, saying that some apps could damage the mental health of young people."

    "story": [
      "Actor Blake Lively has sued the director of the film \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d alleging harassment on the set and a coordinated campaign to smear her reputation",
      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that \u201cthe New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful \u2018untouchable\u2019 Hollywood elites.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",

      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on \u201cAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\u201d the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress.",
      "The title was shortened to \u201cAlice\u201d and Lavin become a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song \"There's a New Girl in Town,\" ran from 1976 to 1985.",
      "The show turned \u201cKiss my grits\u201d into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel\u2019s Diner.",
      "The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into \u201cAll in the Family\u201d on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime\u2019s top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies.",
      "Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's \u201cBroadway Bound\u201d in 1987.",
      "She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, \u201cNo Good Deed,\u201d and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, \u201cMid-Century Modern,\u201d according to Deadline, which first reported her death.",

      "In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on \u201cBarney Miller\u201d and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn\u2019s Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, \u201cAlice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore.\u201d",

And Lavin\u2019s sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.\u201d",
      "Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's \"The Lyons.\" She also starred in \"Other Desert Cities\" and a revival of \u201cFollies\u201d before they transferred to Broadway.",
      "The AP again raved about Lavin in \u201cThe Lyons,\" calling her \"an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm\u2019s length.\"",

      "When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. \"I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,\" she told the AP in 2011.",
      "She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina.",
      "It opened in 2007 and their productions include \"Doubt\" by John Patrick Shanley, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" by David Mamet, \"Rabbit Hole\" by David Lindsay-Abaire and \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\" by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:02:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "Charles Shyer, the Oscar-nominated writer and filmmaker known for classic comedies like \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d \u201cBaby Boom\u201d and \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d that he made alongside Nancy Meyers, has died. He was 83.",
      "Shyer died in Los Angeles on Friday, his daughter, filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer told The Associated Press on Sunday. No cause was disclosed.",
      "A son of Hollywood, whose father Melville Shyer was one of the founding members of the Directors Guild of America, Shyer made an indelible mark on comedies, mostly of the romantic persuasion, in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Born in Los Angeles in 1941, Shyer cut his teeth writing for television, assisting Garry Marshall and working on shows like \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d before transitioning to films. He had writing credits on \u201cSmokey and the Bandit,\u201d Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cGoin\u2019 South\u201d and the Walter Matthau drama \u201cHouse Calls.\u201d A big breakthrough came with \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d the Goldie Hawn comedy about a wealthy woman who inadvertently signs up for basic training, which he co-wrote with Meyers and Harvey Miller.",
      "It was a script that was initially turned down by every studio in Hollywood, even with Hawn attached to star and produce.",
      "\u201cWe went to a meeting at Paramount after they read the script, and Mike Eisner was the president of the studio, and we sat in his office with Mike and (producer) Don Simpson. And Mike said to Goldie, \u2018This is a mistake for you to make this movie,\u2019\u201d Shyer told Indiewire in 2022. \u201cGod bless Don Simpson who spoke up and said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re 100% wrong on this one.\u2019\u201d",
      "The movie became one of the biggest hits of 1980. It got them an Oscar nomination and a win from the Writers Guild and also paved the way for his directorial debut \u201cIrreconcilable Differences.\u201d",
      "That film, which he also wrote with Meyers (they married in 1980), starred Shelley Long and Ryan O\u2019Neal as a writing-directing duo whose relationship crumbles after success and an infatuation with a young actor played by Sharon Stone. It was partially inspired by the tabloid affairs of Peter Bogdanovich, who left his wife and producer Polly Platt for Cybill Shepherd.",
      "\u201cNancy and I just laughed at the same things. We love the same movies, we kind of educate each other on the movies that each of us loved,\u201d Shyer told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd Nancy really made me laugh. I think she wrote the best one-liners of anybody I know, except Neil Simon. And, and we were just always in sync \u2014 as filmmakers, we had this thing.\u201d",
      "They followed with \u201cBaby Boom,\u201d in which Diane Keaton plays a working woman who suddenly has to care for a baby, and \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d which reimagined Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1950 film for the 1990s with Keaton, Steve Martin and Martin Short leading the comedic ensemble. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel.",
      "Shyer and Meyers' last collaboration as a married couple before divorcing in 1999 was the remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d with Lindsay Lohan, which Meyers directed and Shyer co-wrote and produced. Their daughters Annie and Hallie, whose names were used for Lohan\u2019s twin characters, both appeared in the film. Shyer is also survived by two children, Jacob and Sophia, from a subsequent marriage that ended in divorce.",
      "While Shyer often found himself doing remakes, he and Meyers never wanted to do \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of the originals and always endeavored to put their own stamp on their films. But even he was surprised by the longevity of some of them, remembering an old Billy Wilder quote that \u201ccomedy is not like fine wine, it does not age well.\u201d But, he said, they tried to avoid the temptation to include too many timely references.",
      "\u201cYou try to write things that are not basically of the moment, especially in comedy,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cTry to write stories about human beings that will reflect on today and tomorrow and yesterday.\u201d",
      "Shyer went on to remake \u201cAlfie,\u201d with Jude Law, and the Hilary Swank period drama \u201cThe Affair of the Necklace,\u201d neither of which did well at the box office. He also directed the Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte movie \u201cI Love Trouble,\u201d the only film of his that he admitted he didn't like.",
      "Other films never saw the light of day: He spent a year and a half prepping \u201cEloise in Paris\u201d but it was canceled when the production company suddenly went out of business.",
      "He stepped away from directing for many years but returned in recent years with two Netflix Christmas romantic comedies: \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d and \u201cBest. Christmas. Ever!\u201d",
      "\u201cI just gravitated towards stuff I like,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a James Bond movie. I\u2019ve never seen one. I never liked science-fiction movies. \u2026 I like movies about people, and I want them to have substance.\u201d",
      "Shyer had told Indiewire that he was working on a script he'd been thinking about for decades, since he was hospitalized briefly at 17. He described the movie as a cross between \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d And retirement, he said at the time, was not in the cards.",
      "\u201cWhat am I going to do? Garden?\u201d he said. \u201cI just have a lot of energy. I want to keep going. I actually love the process and I love the camaraderie. I love what I do. If I drop dead, maybe it will be holding a camera.\u201d"

      "Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d winning the three-day weekend over \u201cMufasa\u201d by a blue hair.",
      "Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while \u201cMufasa\u201d brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to \u201cWicked,\u201d which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It\u2019s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.",

He generated a huge roar walking out of the tunnel for the coin toss, decked out in a green-and-gold Arizona Bowl sweatsuit, sunglasses, gray Snoop Dogg sneakers, a black Gin & Juice hat and, of course, a bit of bling draped around his neck.",
      "Snoop Dogg shook hands with captains from both sides, flipped the coin \u2014 with a little flair - and posed for a photo with two of the officials before jogging to Colorado State\u2019s sideline, where he donned a headset to do a little play calling.",
      "Between quarters, Snoop Dogg tried to fire the T-shirt cannon \u2014 the shirts only flew a few feet so he waved it off \u2014 and stopped by to bop his head to a circle of Native American performers before heading up to the booth to join the TV broadcast.",
      "\u201cThis is a seven-day-a-week thing with me, man,\u201d Snoop Dogg said during the broadcast. \u201cI guess I\u2019m the people\u2019s champ because I love the people as much as they love me.\u201d",
      "That's for sure.",
      "Snoop Dogg went back down to the field for the halftime interview with Martin, then climbed the bandstand to lead both schools\u2019 bands, hitting the high notes in a medley of his songs. After stint in a suite, Snoop Dogg was back in the booth for the fourth quarter, a small Snoop Cam in the corner of the screen to catch his reactions during the action.",
      "Snoop saved the best for last.",
      "With Miami's players gathered around a makeshift stage, Snoop Dogg rolled out in a light green, lowrider Chevy Impala with gold rims and accents, the shiny Arizona Bowl trophy in his hand as fans screamed his name. After the ceremony, Snoop Dogg handed out gold chains to the players and took a few pictures before a wave of security helped usher him out of the stadium like the rock star he is.",
      "\"Thank you Tucson,\u201d Snoop said. \u201cThank you for welcoming me.\u201d",
      "The pleasure was all theirs.",

      "A trailblazing former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d model who pushed back against age discrimination has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "NEW HOPE, Pa. -- Dayle Haddon, an actor, activist and trailblazing former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d model who pushed back against age discrimination by reentering the industry as a widow, has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home. A 76-year-old man police later identified as Walter J. Blucas of Erie was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "Responders detected a high level of carbon monoxide in the property and township police said Saturday that investigators determined that \u201ca faulty flue and exhaust pipe on a gas heating system caused the carbon monoxide leak.\u201d Two medics were taken to a hospital for carbon monoxide exposure and a police officer was treated at the scene.",
      "As a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1973 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She also appeared in about two dozen films from the 1970s to 1990s, according to IMDb.com, including 1994\u2019s \u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d starring John Cusack.",
      "Haddon left modeling after giving birth to her daughter, Ryan, in the mid-1970s, but then had to reenter the workforce after her husband's 1991 death. This time she found the modeling industry far less friendly: \u201cThey said to me, \u2018At 38, you\u2019re not viable,\u2019\u201d Haddon told The New York Times in 2003.",
      "Working a menial job at an advertising agency, Haddon began reaching out to cosmetic companies, telling them there was a growing market to sell beauty products to aging baby boomers. She eventually landed a contract with Clairol, followed by Est\u00e9e Lauder and then L\u2019Oreal, for which she promoted the company's anti-aging products for more than a decade. She also hosted beauty segments for CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Early Show.\u201d",
      "\"I kept modeling, but in a different way,\" she told The Times, \u201cI became a spokesperson for my age.\u201d",
      "In 2008, Haddon founded WomenOne, an organization aimed at advancing educational opportunities for girls and women in marginalized communities, including Rwanda, Haiti and Jordan.'",
      "Haddon was born in Toronto and began modeling as a teenager to pay for ballet classes \u2014 she began her career with the Canadian ballet company Les Grands Ballet Canadiens, according to her website.",
      "Haddon's daughter, Ryan, said in a social media post that her mother was \u201ceveryone\u2019s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pure heart. A rich inner life. Touching so many lives. A life well lived. Rest in Light, Mom,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.",
      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge.",

      "Its bright geometric shapes are part of 89-year-old South African artist Esther Mahlangu \u2019s unmistakable style. The car is the centerpiece of an exhibition honoring her and her work.",
      "The BMW, commissioned by the German manufacturer in 1991, is among Mahlangu\u2019s most well-known works and has been returned to South Africa this year after more than 30 years abroad.",
      "Exhibition curator Nontobeko Ntombela also has included pieces that document the struggles of Nelson Mandela, who was released after almost three decades in prison and became South Africa's first Black president when the country transitioned from white minority rule to democracy in 1994.",
      "These include a letter Mahlangu wrote to Mandela thanking him for the sacrifices he made for the country.",
      "She is respected for persevering with art at a time when Black artists, especially women, were hardly acknowledged.",
      "\u201cMahlangu dared to travel an uncharted path during a time when Black women artists were systemically overlooked. I hope when people see just how much she has done, they will realize the magnitude of what she has offered to the arts,\u201d Ntombela said.",
      "The retrospective also includes a documentary about the artist, where she tells the story of her rural upbringing and her Ndebele culture.",
      "For decades, Mahlangu has used her talent to promote that culture, becoming arguably the southern African ethnic group's most recognized representative.",
      "Ntombela said much of the publicly available information about Mahlangu tends to repeat the same narratives, including her first international show in Paris in 1989.",
      "\u201cSome tend to overly emphasize the culture without the balance of discussing her work as an art form. The exhibition tries to complicate this and hopefully offers an opportunity of how her art moves across these different fields and disciplines,\" the curator said.",
      "Some of the artworks showing umgwalo, or traditional Ndebele painting, were borrowed from collections locally and abroad. Ntombela said it took about two years to secure them.",

      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" Berson said.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back.",
      "\u201cNot only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,\u201d said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. \u201cHis love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.\u201d",
      "Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \u201cBy my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\u201d",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,\u201d he added.",
      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

      "When Snoop Dogg agreed to become the sponsor of the Arizona Bowl, he had a demand: It must have a NIL component",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg has nearly as many ties to football as he does to rap music.",
      "The entertainer coached youth football for years and created the Snoop League, an after-school program for inner city Los Angeles youths. Snoop has been a guest analyst on football broadcasts and his son, Cordell Broadus, played Division I football.",
      "When Snoop took his latest step, becoming the sponsor of a bowl game, he had a demand: Find a way for all players in the game to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) money.",
      "\u201cThis was Snoop's idea,\u201d said Kym Adair, executive director of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. \u201cHe was having conversations with people he knows in the college football world and I got a call that said he wants us to be the first bowl to make this commitment and that's what we did.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries are Colorado State and Miami (Ohio), who will conclude their seasons Saturday at Arizona Stadium in the Arizona Bowl. The bowl is classified as a 501(c)(3), so all revenue goes to charity. And, being one of the few bowls not tied to ESPN, it opens the door for unique sponsorship opportunities.",
      "The bowl was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports and the digital media company used its own cast of characters on the broadcast, which was streamed on its digital platforms.",
      "Snoop Dogg takes over this year. The rapper/entertainer is the latest celebrity to sponsor a bowl, following the footsteps of Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski at the LA Bowl.",
      "And, Snoop being Snoop, he wanted to put his own spin on his own bowl.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we get back to the roots of college football \u2014 when it was focused on the colleges, the players and the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry.\u201d",
      "With that will be an NIL component.",
      "The bowl can't pay players just for playing in the bowl, but both teams participated in football clinics on Friday and will get paid for their services. Other bowls have given single players NIL opportunities, but this is believed to be the first to offer it to every player on both teams.",
      "\u201cI love the fact that the Arizona Bowl is unique and tries new things, and obviously having Snoop here is unique,\u201d Colorado State coach Jay Norvell said. \u201cThe NIL component, it\u2019s the future. It\u2019s what football has become now. We think it\u2019s fantastic for our kids and then the interaction with the kids is the hidden gem of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The NIL component of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl comes a month after a similar effort in The Players Era Festival basketball tournament in Las Vegas. The eight-team tournament said it paid out $9 million in NIL money to participating players for activities outside the competition. It also offered $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years for services and activities compliant with NCAA regulations.",
      "Are the Players Era Festival and Arizona Bowl the start of a new future? It is not out of the question in big-time college athletics, where schools are already preparing for the era of revenue sharing with players next year.",
      "\u201cRevenue sharing between the players and the athletic departments is already on the horizon, so whether that takes the place of these types of arrangements or they're completely separate has yet to be determined,\" Adair said. \"We're just trying to be flexible, ahead of the curve and make an impact any way we can.\u201d",
      "Just the way Snoop wants it.",

      "The former Morrison Hotel, which was famously on the cover of a 1970 album by The Doors, has been significantly damaged by a fire in downtown Los Angeles",
      "The former Morrison Hotel, made famous by The Doors and their 1970 album of the same name, was significantly damaged by a fire that erupted in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday.",
      "The four-story building, which has been vacant more than a decade, burned for nearly two hours before more than 100 firefighters brought the flames under control, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.",
      "The Morrison Hotel was featured on the cover of The Doors' fifth album. Celebrated music photographer Henry Diltz made the image in 1969 and said years later that it took a little trickery to pull it off.",
      "A hotel clerk told the band they weren't allowed to take photos inside, but when the clerk stepped away, the group ran into the lobby and Diltz quickly got the photo looking through the window, with legendary frontman Jim Morrison in the middle.",
      "\u201cIt was a great old wooden building with many small rooms upstairs where transients and drinkers could sleep it off on a cot for $2.50 a night!\" Diltz told The Associated Press on Friday. \"I think the beautiful front window with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in red letters was the best part of it! So did The Doors!\u201d",
      "The album was viewed as a comeback to their roots for The Doors, coming on the heels of Morrison's on-stage arrest at a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity.",
      "Morrison and The Doors would release one final album, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d before he was found dead in a Paris bathtub on July 3, 1971.",
      "Los Angeles firefighters who first arrived at the blaze on Thursday found heavy flames on the building's top floor.",
      "Several people who were in the building escaped without injuries, including three people rescued by firefighters from the third floor, according to the department. The building\u2019s roof collapsed, leaving its structural integrity in doubt, the department said.",
      "The building in recent years had been used as a training site for firefighters."

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
    "story": [
      "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Colorado becomes the second state to legalize psychedelic therapy this week, a clash is playing out in Colorado Springs, where conservative leaders are restricting the treatment over objections from some of the city's 90,000 veterans, who've become flagbearers for psychedelic therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Colorado residents voted to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the chemical compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, in a 2022 ballot measure, launching two years of rulemaking before it could be used to treat conditions such as depression and PTSD.",
      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",

      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",

      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines.

      "",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.",
      "A norovirus infection is characterized by sudden vomiting and diarrhea. Outbreaks are often seen on cruise ships, in congregate living situations like nursing homes and jails, as well as schools and places where people are close together.",

      "There are about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks reported annually in the United States. The outbreaks can occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April.",
      "Along with with vomiting and diarrhea, common symptoms include nausea, stomach pain, body ache, headache and fever.",

      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help."

      "Even with abortion bans in place in most Republican-controlled states, the number of people obtaining them has grown slightly",
      "Abortion has become slightly more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet.",
      "It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.",
      "The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "Here's a look at data on where things stand:",
      "Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the U.S.",
      "But one thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.",
      "There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.",
      "\u201cAbortion bans don\u2019t actually prevent abortions from happening,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "But, she said, they do change care.",
      "For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions \u2014 and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.",
      "For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.",
      "As the bans swept in, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.",
      "They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it\u2019s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.",
      "But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions was via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.",
      "This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances,\u201d and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.",
      "Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.",
      "But a network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortion in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.",
      "Abortion funds, which benefitted from \u201crage giving\u201d in 2022, have helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.",
      "Since the downfall of Roe, the actions of lawmakers and courts have kept shifting where abortion is legal and under what conditions.",
      "Here's where it stands now:",
      "Florida, the nation\u2019s second most-populous state, began enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy on May 1.",
      "That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortion to an exporter of people looking for them.",
      "There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.",
      "While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.",
      "The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.",
      "But some states where abortion remains legal until viability \u2013 generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there\u2019s no fixed time for it \u2013 have seen clinics open and expand.",
      "Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.",
      "There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.",
      "But Myers says some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So they\u2019re now in the count of clinics \u2013 even though they might provide few of them.",
      "How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration says hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration\u2019s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.",
      "More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms and were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.",
      "Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,\u201d Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.",
      "Since Roe was overturned, there have been 18 reproductive rights-related statewide ballot questions.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on 14 of them and lost on four.",
      "In the 2024 election, they amended the constitutions in five states to add the right to abortion. Such measures failed in three states: In Florida, where it required 60% support; in Nebraska, which had competing abortion ballot measures; and in South Dakota, where most national abortion rights groups did support the measure.",
      "AP VoteCast data found that more than three-fifths of voters in 2024 supported abortion being legal in all or most cases \u2013 a slight uptick from 2020. The support came even as voters supported Republicans to control the White House and both houses of Congress.",

      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation\u2019s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week.",
      "Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans \u2014 something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm.",
      "Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work.",
      "\u201cIs this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cRight now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn\u2019t open the door.\u201d",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms.",

The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month.",
      "The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were \u201cconcerning,\u201d but the risk to the general public from the outbreak \u201chas not changed and remains low.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass.",
      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",
      "\u201cAny successful story, there must be painful experiences,\u201d he said.",

      "\"Today's result sends a clear message to the Medicare Advantage community that the United States will take appropriate action against those who knowingly submit inflated claims for reimbursement,\" Michael Granston, a Department of Justice (DOJ) deputy assistant attorney general, said in announcing the settlement on December 20.",
      "",
      "Frank Sava, a spokesperson for Independent Health, said in a statement: \"The assertions by the DOJ are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability. This settlement is not an admission of any wrongdoing; it instead allows us to avoid the further disruption, expense, and uncertainty of litigation in a matter that has lingered for over a decade.\"",
      "",
      "Under the settlement, Independent Health will make \"guaranteed payments\" of $34.5 million in installments from 2024 through 2028. Whether it pays the maximum amount in the settlement will depend on the health plan's financial performance.",
      "",
      "Michael Ronickher, an attorney for whistleblower Teresa Ross, called the settlement \"historic,\" saying it was the largest payment yet by a health plan based solely on a whistleblower's fraud allegations. It also was one of the first to accuse a data mining firm of helping a health plan overcharge.",
      "",
      "The settlement is the latest in a whirl of whistleblower actions alleging billing fraud by a Medicare Advantage insurer. Medicare Advantage plans are private health plans that cover more than 33 million members, making up over half of all people eligible for Medicare. They are expected to grow further under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "",
      "But as Medicare Advantage has gained popularity, regulators at CMS have struggled to prevent health plans from exaggerating how sick patients are to boost their revenues.",
      "",
      "Whistleblowers such as Ross, a former medical coding professional, have helped the government claw back hundreds of millions of dollars in overpayments tied to alleged coding abuses. Ross will receive at least $8.2 million, according to the Justice Department.",
      "",
      "Ross said that CMS \"created a bounty\" for health plans that added medical diagnosis codes as they reviewed patients' charts  --  and whether those codes were accurate or not \"didn't seem to bother some people.\"",

      "\"Billions of dollars are being paid out by CMS for diagnoses that don't exist,\" Ross told KFF Health News in an interview.",
      "",
      "Data Mining",

      "DOJ's civil complaint, filed in September 2021, was unusual in targeting a data analytics venture  --  and its top executive  --  for allegedly ginning up bogus payments.",
      "",
      "DxID specialized in mining electronic medical records to capture new diagnoses for patients  --  pocketing up to 20% of the money it generated for the health plan, according to the suit, which said Independent Health used the firm from 2010 through 2017. DxID shut down in 2021.",
      "",
      "Gaffney pitched its services to Medicare Advantage plans as \"too attractive to pass up,\" according to the Justice Department complaint.",
      "",
      "\"There is no upfront fee, we don't get paid until you get paid and we work on a percentage of the actual proven recoveries,\" Gaffney said, according to the complaint. Timothy Hoover, an attorney for Gaffney, said in a statement that the settlement \"is not an admission of any liability by Ms. Gaffney. The settlement simply resolves a dispute and provides closure to the parties.\"",
      "",
      "'A Ton of Money'",
      "",
      "CMS uses a complex formula that pays health plans higher rates for sicker patients and less for people in good health. Health plans must retain medical records that document all diagnoses they highlight for reimbursement.",
      "",
      "Independent Health violated those rules by billing Medicare for a range of medical conditions that either were exaggerated or not supported by patient medical files, such as billing for treating chronic depression that had been resolved, according to the complaint. In one case, an 87-year-old man was coded as having \"major depressive disorder\" even though his medical records indicated the problem was \"transient,\" according to the complaint.",
      "",
      "DxID also cited chronic kidney disease or renal failure \"in the absence of any documentation suggesting that a patient suffered from those conditions,\" according to the complaint. Past conditions, such as heart attacks, that required no current treatment, also were coded, according to the DOJ.",
      "",
      "The suit alleges that Gaffney said renal failure diagnoses were \"worth a ton of money to IH [Independent Health] and the majority of people (over) 70 have it at some level.\"",
      "",
      "Ross filed the whistleblower case in 2012 against Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, one of the nation's oldest managed-care groups.",
      "",
      "Ross, a former medical coding manager there, alleged that DxID submitted more than $30 million in disease claims  --  many of which were not valid  --  on behalf of Group Health for 2010 and 2011. For instance, Ross alleged that the plan billed for \"major depression\" in a patient described by his doctor as having an \"amazingly sunny disposition.\"",
      "",
      "Group Health, now known as the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington, denied wrongdoing. But it settled the civil case in November 2020 by agreeing to pay $6.3 million. The DOJ filed a second complaint in 2021, against Independent Health, which also used DxID's services.",
      "",
      "Ross said she lost her job after her suit became public in 2019 and was unable to secure another one in the medical coding field.",
      "",
      "\"It was rough at times, but we got through it,\" she said. Ross, 60, said she is now \"happily retired.\"",
      "",
      "False Claims",
      "",
      "Whistleblowers sue under the False Claims Act, a federal law dating to the Civil War that allows private citizens to expose fraud against the government and share in any recovery.",
      "",
      "At least two dozen such suits, some dating to 2009, have targeted Medicare Advantage plans for overstating the severity of medical conditions, a practice known in the industry as \"upcoding.\" Previous settlements from such suits have totaled more than $600 million.",
      "",
      "The whistleblowers have played a key role in holding health insurers accountable.",
      "",
      "While dozens of CMS audits have concluded that health plans overcharged the government, the agency has done little to recoup money for the U.S. Treasury.",
      "",
      "In a surprise action in late January 2023, CMS announced that it would settle for a fraction of the estimated tens of millions of dollars in overpayments uncovered through its audits dating to 2011 and not impose major financial penalties on health plans until a round of audits for 2018 payments, which have yet to be done. Exactly how much plans will end up paying back is unclear.",
      "",

      "To encourage the development of vaccines and drugs against pandemic illness and other serious threats, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005 authorized the establishment of the CICP while limiting the legal liability of manufacturers and others involved in the making, distribution, and administration of certain countermeasures.",

      "\"Instead of suing manufacturers or others, individuals can apply to CICP for compensation for serious physical injuries or deaths resulting from covered countermeasures,\" the GAO report explained.",

      "As of June, HRSA had paid 51 of the 92 CICP claims found eligible for compensation, totaling nearly $6.5 million.",
      "",
      "Most of the payments ($6.1 million) were for deaths or serious injuries, such as Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, caused by the H1N1 vaccine. These payments ranged from $31 to nearly $2.3 million per claim.",
      "",
      "Additionally, some $419,000 in payments went to 14 claimants for serious injuries caused by COVID countermeasures, such as myocarditis. These payments ranged from $1,032 to $370,376 per claim.",
      "",
      "Among the 3,484 claims that completed the adjudication process as of July of this year, there were 486 requests to reconsider claim decisions. Nearly all of these requests were related to COVID countermeasures, and more than 80% were due to a claimant disagreeing with a decision made during administrative review, such as missing a filing deadline or supporting documentation.",
      "",
      "HRSA's independent reconsideration panel reviewed 392 of these requests as of July, finding that 99% remained ineligible for compensation. Three claims did have a decision reversed, and were sent back to CICP for medical review.",
      "",
      "A major challenge for the CICP was a shortage of staff to adjudicate the large influx of claims, including those needed to conduct administrative and medical reviews for COVID countermeasure claims. At the start of the COVID pandemic, CICP had only four staff members, according to the GAO report.",
      "",
      "Another challenge was outdated information systems to process a large number of claims, including an initial reliance on mailed-in claims at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, and further reliance on certified mail for communications with claimants.",

      "Several bariatric surgeons told MedPage Today they are frequently checking their specialty's job boards. Some said they're enrolling in refresher courses for other kinds of foregut surgery, such as hernia repair, gallbladder removal, or esophageal procedures. One surgeon has pivoted to telemedicine prescribing.",
      "",
      "Helmuth Billy, MD, a bariatric surgeon in Ventura, California, said next year, he's \"throwing out a lifeboat to expand his practice to cosmetic/plastic abdominoplasties and tummy tucks\" to past surgery patients to help his bottom line. \"We have a lot of patients who can't afford plastic surgeons.\"",

      "One of the Journey Clinic's terminated surgeons, Azure Adkins, MD, got excited when she recently learned that a medical center just north of Charlotte, North Carolina, was recruiting a full-time bariatric surgeon. But after interviewing, they'd changed their minds, she told MedPage Today. \"They said they realized their volumes had diminished enough that 'we don't really need another full-time bariatric surgeon at this point.'\"",

      "She's not alone. Many other bariatric surgeons interviewed said they see the GLP-1 agonists as \"gateway drugs\" that will bring more patients to surgery. Eventually.",
      "",
      "A common lament among nearly all surgeons interviewed is that fear of surgery or social stigma have long kept 99% of patients with obesity who could be helped by bariatric surgery away from seeking any kind of help.",
      "",
      "Now, patients are swarming in, said Fernando Elli, MD, one of four surgeons who performs bariatric surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. \"They want to see us not because they're interested in bariatric surgery. They want the medications,\" he said.",
      "",
      "But many of those patients are learning their insurance won't cover the drugs, or are alarmed that they would have to inject themselves every week indefinitely, or that if they stop, or take a drug holiday, they'll regain the weight.",
      "",
      "\"What we are seeing now with more exposure to these drugs is that patients start the medications but they don't tolerate the side effects. They drop it and say, 'Let's go for surgery,'\" Elli said.",
      "",
      "But that isn't happening a lot, at least not yet. His clinic's surgical volume dropped from 280 in 2023 to 220 this year, which he thinks will be stable until the limitations of the new injectable drugs become clearer, not just to patients but to their doctors as well.",
      "",
      "Surgeons also think that patients will eventually choose surgery because experience and data show surgery produces a greater and faster weight loss after a year than 52 weeks of GLP-1 injections.",
      "",
      "\"At best the GLP-1s can get you to about 14% total body weight loss; surgery is more like 30%,\" after a year or 18 months, Rogers said, pointing to a 2022 review in Advances in Therapy.",
      "",
      "Elli thinks the comparison is 10% to 20% versus 50%, and other surgeons shared different estimates, depending on the patient and the drug.",
      "",
      "Tsai said a head-to-head comparison hasn't yet been published, and perhaps the drug companies aren't eager to fund such a study. \"But at some point the NIH will fund a direct comparison.\"",
      "",
      "Sandi Petros, 33, a restorative dental specialist in San Diego, is an example. At 299 pounds, she never wanted to try the drugs because she knew surgery was faster and more permanent, and she wanted to lose the weight for her two young boys. Last week, 1 year after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, she had dropped 102 pounds. She no longer has type 2 diabetes, and her LDL, 140 before surgery, is now normal.",
      "",
      "Teresa LaMasters, MD, a past president of ASMBS, expressed similar optimism. \"In the long run, the drugs will actually help us.\"",
      "",
      "\"What's going to be the thing that holds patients back on medicines is their cost, access, availability, and how people will tolerate them,\" said LaMasters, who also is the medical director of bariatric surgery at Unity Point Clinic at Iowa Methodist Hospital in West Des Moines.",
      "",
      "Another trend that can improve the prospect of surgery's revival is that several insurance companies have reportedly dropped some of their more rigorous requirements for bariatric preparation, and some have dropped the need for prior authorization review.",
      "",
      "Additionally, some health plans are capping how much they'll pay for the GLP-1 drugs, if they cover them at all. The Mayo Clinic has capped that lifetime spending at $20,000, Elli said.",
      "",
      "An Uptick Already",
      "",
      "Farah Husain, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix, said her hospital has seen a small uptick in surgical patients from 550 in 2023 to about 580 this year.",
      "",
      "\"I'm seeing patients sometimes with BMIs of 60, 70, 80, and no one has ever mentioned surgery to them before,\" she said. \"The only reason they come in is because they saw something about the medications. These are people who need such a significant amount of weight loss, they need surgery on top of the drugs.\"",
      "",
      "Some private practice surgeons contracted with Kaiser Permanente to perform bariatric surgery for the health plan's enrollees are also reporting a bump in patients in recent months.",
      "",
      "\"The GLPs have thrust a huge new cost on the Kaiser system that is probably unsustainable,\" said Billy, a Kaiser contractor. Lately, he said, \"we're seeing more Kaiser volume than we've ever seen before.\"",
      "",
      "Many clinicians interviewed said that just as cancer treatment often requires a combination of surgery and drugs, combination therapy will be the treatment plan for many patients with obesity. They may take the medications to lower weight to better prepare them for surgery, or after surgery after they reach a plateau.",
      "",
      "A possible offsetting factor is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposal last month that it would pay for the new weight loss drugs in 2026, if the new administration approves.",
      "",
      "Making Adjustments",
      "",
      "The Mayo Clinic has made adjustments to respond to the change in surgical volume, Elli said. \"We have shifted our practice so that we have more non-surgical practitioners to accommodate those patients who don't want surgery.\"",
      "",
      "Nationally, he expects many bariatric surgeons will adjust as well, diversifying their surgical repertoire. \"Surgeons who are only doing bariatric surgery need to reconfigure,\" he said. \"Current bariatric fellowship graduates may find it difficult to obtain a pure bariatric practice and may need to alternate with acute care surgery.\"",
      "",
      "For many bariatric surgeons, the prospect of taking on general surgery  --  where often it's one-and-done  --  goes against the reason they chose weight-loss surgery as a specialty. They wanted longer-term relationships with their patients.",
      "",
      "\"We operate on the patients and ideally follow them for as long as they're willing to come back, to make sure they're maintaining weight loss and healthy habits and help them along the way,\" Husain said. \"The theme in our world is that obesity is a chronic disease.\"",
      "",
      "The Payers Aren't Helping",
      "",
      "Benjamin Clapp, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus in El Paso, Texas, chairs the ASMBS task force that tracks bariatric surgical volume every year.",
      "",
      "He said neither the official totals for 2023 nor estimates for 2024 are collected yet. However, data from centers accredited by the American College of Surgeons, which perform about 80% to 83% of all bariatric surgeries in this country, show that volumes were down by 5.5%, or more than 12,000 weight-reduction surgeries, in 2023.",
      "",
      "But 2024 is expected to be \"much, much worse because of the overwhelming impact that the GLP-1 drugs have had, which really took off this year,\" Clapp said.",
      "",
      "This year in El Paso he expects to perform 120 bariatric surgeries, compared with 180 in 2023. \"These are massive decreases in volume, at least for me,\" he said. \"I went from seeing 15 to 20 new bariatric patients weekly to one to three.\"",
      "",
      "The Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery at Columbia University said earlier this year that it expected a 10% to 20% decline in 2024 from 2023.",
      "",
      "That drop in bariatric demand is one of two big reasons why Clapp has made a career decision to leave the solo practice he has built up for the last 18 years.",
      "",
      "Sometime next year, he plans to either take an academic job and devote more time to studying how brain receptors function in rats with obesity, or become an employed hospital surgeon. On staff, he would do any variety of procedures and probably far fewer bariatric procedures on which he has built his practice.",
      "",
      "The other reason is declining reimbursement. Clapp said Medicare rates for common bariatric surgery CPT codes have dropped since 2019, despite rising inflation in practice costs. A check with Medicare's physician fee lookup tool shows he's right. For example, the national payment amount for a laparoscopic gastric bypass with small intestine reconstruction dropped from $1,937.82 to $1,842.13 between 2019 and 2024. Insurance companies generally follow Medicare.",
      "",
      "What's worse is that consultation pay has also been going down or has disappeared. \"Things are bundled more, so you get paid less overall,\" he said. \"It's like death by 1,000 cuts.\" Solo private practice \"has just become a model that's not sustainable, for myself or for my family.\"",
      "",
      "Clapp has filled in some of the blanks with other foregut surgeries, such as cholecystectomies and hernia repairs, but reimbursement rates have dropped for those, too, especially relative to his own practice costs.",
      "",
      "San Diego bariatric surgeon William Fuller, MD, said Scripps Mercy Hospital, one of the largest programs on the West Coast, will have performed around 800 bariatric surgeries in 2024, down from the prior year's 1,000. But he doesn't expect a year-over-year decline in perpetuity as some of his counterparts fear.",
      "",
      "\"Who knows when there will be a stabilization of this whole phenomenon?\" he asked rhetorically during an interview with a public relations representative present. \"But we see patients who tried some of these medications  --  when they had access to them  --  and they haven't had the same success. They had some rebound, regained weight, or just didn't have success to begin with.\"",
      "",
      "Bottom line: \"It's all about sustainability, which is always the case with medications,\" he said. \"How long can you remain on them, and for efficacy purposes and economic purposes, how are these medications going to be funded, with what kind of subsidies? There's still a lot of moving parts.\""

      "The majority of the migrants are from Venezuela, but they also include people from Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru and Ecuador. They've said they are tired of being blocked from crossing Mexico by the government.",
      "Though previous caravans have said they intend to reach the border \u2014 something that was almost never achieved \u2014 the migrants in the new caravan appear to be less clear about where they were headed. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to prevent migrants from entering the United States and stage mass deportations of those already in the country.",

The eldest Missoni son and the company\u2019s CEO, Vittorio Missoni, died when a plane carrying him and five others disappeared off Venezuela.

      "Researchers in England have unearthed nearly 200 dinosaur tracks that date back 166 million years",
      "LONDON -- A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.",
      "The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.",
      "\u201cThese footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.",
      "Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 60 feet (18 meters) in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 9-meter predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.",
      "An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.",
      "\u201cScientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.",
      "The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.",
      "\u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out,\" said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. \"Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d",
      "The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's \u201cDigging for Britain\u201d program next week.",

Tehran confirmed Monday that Sala had been arrested on charges of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.",

      "Abedini\u2019s Italian lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco, asked the Milan court this week to grant him house arrest, a decision that is pending, De Francesco said in an email. He declined to respond when asked to comment on the U.S. charges or possible links to the Sala case.",
      "Italian media have reported that Sala is essentially being used as a bargaining chip by Iran to secure Abedini\u2019s release. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani didn\u2019t dispute that scenario when he was asked about it during a call-in to the Rete4 broadcast Sunday.",
      "Ever since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis in Iran, in which dozens of U.S. hostages spent 444 days in captivity in Tehran, Iran has frequently used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations.",

      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",

      "Among the seven survivors of the New Year\u2019s Eve wreck off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa was an 8-year-old girl whose mother is among the missing, UNICEF said.",
      "The agency noted that last month, an 11-year-old girl found floating off Lampedusa was believed to be the lone survivor of a migrant boat that had left Sfax, Tunisia, with about 45 people on board.",
      "According to the International Organization of Migration\u2019s missing migrant tracker, 2,275 people were unaccounted for in the Mediterranean in 2024, bringing the total number of people missing since 2014 to 31,180. The vast majority -\u2013 24,466 -- were believed to have died on the perilous central Mediterranean route, which is most often used by smugglers from Libya and Tunisia to ferry desperate people toward Italy.",
      "UNICEF called on governments to honor their obligations under international law regarding refugees and to prioritize the safeguarding of children. \u201cThis includes ensuring safe, legal pathways for protection and family reunification, as well as coordinated search and rescue operations, safe disembarkation, community-based reception, and access to asylum services,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Under Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Italy has tried to stem arrivals by cracking down on migrant smuggling operations and deterring would-be refugees with the threat of having their asylum claims processed in Albania. Last year, 66,317 migrants arrived in Italy by boat, fewer than half as many as in the previous year, according to Interior Ministry statistics."

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A court in southeastern Bangladesh on Thursday rejected a plea for bail by a jailed Hindu leader who led large rallies in the Muslim-majority country demanding better security for minority groups.",
      "Krishna Das Prabhu, 39, faces sedition charges after he led huge rallies in the southeastern city of Chattogram. Hindu groups say there have been thousands of attacks against Hindus since early August, when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown.",
      "Prabhu didn't appear at the hearing, during which Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam rejected the bail plea, according to Public Prosecutor Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan. Security was tight, with police and soldiers guarding the court.",
      "\u201cHe faces serious charges like sedition and others involving the security and sovereignty of our country,\" Bhuiyan told The Associated Press by phone. \"We argued in the court that if he gets bail it could create anarchy as we saw in the past that he triggered violence on the court premises by calling thousands of his supporters to protest.",
      "\"So, we moved against his bail plea as we believed that he could misuse his bail.\u201d",
      "Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee, a lawyer representing Prabhu, said that they would appeal the decision.",
      "The court rejected an earlier request for bail made while Prabhu didn't have lawyers. Lawyers who sought to represent him at that hearing said they were threatened or intimidated, and many of them are facing charges related to the death of a Muslim lawyer during clashes outside the court when Prabhu appeared there shortly after being arrested in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, in November.",
      "For Thursday's hearing, 11 lawyers traveled from Dhaka, arriving and leaving with a security escort.",

Yunus and his supporters said that reports of attacks on Hindus and other groups since August have been exaggerated.",
      "Prabhu\u2019s arrest came as tensions spiked following reports of the desecration of the Indian flag in Bangladesh, with some burning it and others laying it on the floor for people to step on. Protesters in India responded in kind.",
      "Prabhu is a spokesman for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote group. He was also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, widely known as the Hare Krishna movement.",
      "Radharamn Das, vice president and spokesman of the group in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, told the television station India Today that Prabhu's health is deteriorating.",
      "Das said that the jailed Hindu leader \"has become a face of minorities in Bangladesh. The minorities see him as a ray of hope. He represents their voice.\""

      "Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has issued a defiant statement to his rightwing supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a defiant statement to his conservative supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul, vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against what he called \u201canti-state forces,\u201d as law enforcement prepared to detain him over last month\u2019s martial law decree.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials has a week to execute its detainment warrant against Yoon, issued by a Seoul court on Tuesday. The warrant came after Yoon defied several requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office, hindering an investigation into whether his short-lived power grab on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion.",
      "Oh Dong-woon, the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, has indicated that police forces might be deployed if Yoon\u2019s security service resists the detention attempt, which could occur as early as Thursday. But it remains unclear whether Yoon can be compelled to submit to questioning.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team issued a statement on Thursday warning that any attempt by the anti-corruption agency to use police mobile units for his detention would exceed their legal authority. The lawyers further said that police officers could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens\u201d if they try to detain him.",
      "In a message to hundreds of supporters gathered outside his residence Wednesday evening, Yoon said he would continue to fight against anti-state forces \u201cviolating our sovereignty\u201d and putting the nation in \u201cdanger.\u201d He applauded his supporters for their efforts to protect the country\u2019s \u201cliberal democracy and constitutional order\u201d and said he was watching their protests on live YouTube broadcasts, according to a photo of the message shared by Yoon\u2019s lawyers.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative vote that impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the martial law imposition, accused the president of trying to mobilize his supporters to block his detention and called for law enforcement authorities to execute the warrant immediately.",
      "A growing number of Yoon\u2019s supporters were again gathering near his residence on Thursday morning amid a heavy police presence, waving small South Korean and American flags and holding signs opposing his impeachment.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have argued that the court\u2019s detainment warrant is \u201cinvalid,\u201d claiming that the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. They also accuse the court of bypassing a law that says locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "Some experts believe the anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities, would not risk clashing with Yoon\u2019s security service, which has said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law. The office may instead issue another summons for Yoon to appear for questioning if they are not able to execute the detainment warrant by Jan. 6.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended following the National Assembly vote to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoon\u2019s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",
      "To formally end Yoon\u2019s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoon\u2019s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court\u2019s review of Yoon\u2019s case.",
      "In the face of growing pressure, the country\u2019s new interim leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which possibly increased the chances of the court upholding Yoon\u2019s impeachment.",
      "Cho Han-chang, one of the newly appointed court justices, said Thursday that he begins his job with a \u201cheavy heart.\u201d Jeong Gye-seon, the other new justice, expressed hope that the remaining vacancy would be filled.",

El Salvador\u2019s official total does not include the killings of five suspected gang members in shootouts with security forces.",

      "Despite the restrictions, the improvements in security have contributed to Bukele\u2019s extremely high popularity. For years, many Salvadorans lived in fear of the gangs that controlled swaths of the country, extorting, killing and forcibly recruiting.",

      "The congress, in which Bukele's party and allies hold a supermajority, continues to renew the special powers each month.",
      "The gangs' repressive control made it difficult and dangerous for residents to travel between neighborhoods, including for work. Now residents say they can walk their neighborhoods without fear.",
      "In February, Bukele romped to victory, winning an unprecedented second five-year term despite a constitutional ban on consecutive reelection. A friendly Supreme Court allowed it."

      "By Wednesday afternoon, power was back up for 98% of Puerto Rico\u2019s 1.47 million utility customers, said Luma Energy, the private company overseeing transmission and distribution of power in the archipelago. Lights returned to households as well as to Puerto Rico\u2019s hospitals, water plants and sewage facilities after the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems plaguing the island.",
      "Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island could take up to two days.",
      "\u201cGiven the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage available generation to customer demand, which will likely require rotating temporary outages,\u201d Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said in a statement.",
      "The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an underground electric line in the south of the territory.",

In June, over 340,000 customers were left without electricity as people reeled from soaring temperatures. At the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, in August, over half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm.",
      "The New Year\u2019s Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau says."

      "Some Russian media critical of the Kremlin cited Russian volunteers as saying that state support has been inadequate as they grapple with the consequences of the spill. Some said they experienced headaches, nausea and vomiting after spending hours inhaling toxic fumes, and complained of insufficient equipment and protective measures.",
      "Others called for international specialists to be sent in, citing the scale of the spill and the likely extent of the impact.",
      "Photos circulating on social media and local news channels showed seabirds coated in black fuel oil.",
      "The spill may have killed more than 20 dolphins, the local Delfa dolphin rescue centre said, adding tests were ongoing to ascertain the cause of the deaths.",
      "The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.",
      "It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, last month described the oil spill as a \u201clarge-scale environmental disaster\u201d and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers."

      "Protesters in Syria have held a sit-in demanding justice for four activists who were forcibly disappeared in 2013 and whose fate remains one of the most haunting mysteries of the country\u2019s 13-year civil war",
      "DOUMA, Syria -- Protesters in Syria held a sit-in Wednesday demanding justice for four activists who were forcibly disappeared in 2013 and whose fate remains one of the most haunting mysteries of the country's 13-year civil war.",
      "On Dec. 9, 2013, gunmen stormed the Violation Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and took Razan Zaitouneh, her husband Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi.",
      "Outspoken and defiantly secular, Zaitouneh was one of Syria\u2019s most well-known human rights activists. Perhaps most dangerously, she was impartial. She chanted in protests against then-President Bashar Assad but was also unflinching in documenting abuses by rebels fighting to oust him.",
      "There has been no sign of life nor proof of death since she and her colleagues were abducted.",
      "Since the ouster of Assad on Dec. 8, protests have erupted across Syria demanding information about thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared under his rule. The new leadership under the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which orchestrated the offensive to oust Assad, has maintained a neutral stance regarding accusations against various armed groups for forcibly disappearing activists. At the same time, HTS has aligned with activists in their efforts to uncover the truth and seek justice.",
      "\u201cWe are gathering here to remind the world of their case,\u201d Yassin Haj Saleh, Khalil\u2019s husband, said Wednesday, adding that the disappearance of activists represents \u201cthe deepest wounds\u201d of Syria\u2019s conflict. \u201cThis is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma, and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.\u201d",
      "Saleh said they had repeatedly appealed to various armed groups for cooperation in finding the four activists in the years before Assad's ouster but were met with silence.",
      "Strong clues had pointed to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time, as the perpetrators. The group, made up of religious hard-liners who were pushing out other rebels and imposing strict Shariah rules, long denied involvement. An Army of Islam official, Hamza Bayraqdar, told The Associated Press in 2018 they brought Zaitouneh to Douma to protect her from the Assad government.",
      "The Army of Islam repeatedly blamed the Assad government, along with the Nusra Front \u2014 an al-Qaida-linked group originally founded by the current HTS leader \u2014 for his wife's disappearance, Saleh said.",
      "Zaitouneh was a prominent human rights lawyer and founder of the Violation Documentation Center. She also helped organize networks of activists like the Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella network made up of activists who organized protests as part of the Syrian uprising.",
      "Her work earned her international recognition, including an International Woman of Courage award presented by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013.",
      "Several of those who spoke to the AP in 2018 said the Army of Islam saw Zaitouneh documenting abuses as a threat and resented her local administration plan as an encroachment on their power. Zaitouneh received a series of threats that friends and activists said traced back to the Army of Islam.",
      "The Army of Islam was forced to move north in 2018 after the Assad government retook Douma, leading to the group's weakening and disintegration. Hopes that Zaitouneh and her colleagues would emerge among released prisoners during that time were unmet.",
      "Today, the Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It did not fight alongside the other Islamist factions that led the offensive against Assad and remains excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership. Recently, an Army of Islam delegation met HTS leader Ahmad Sharaa to explore integration into the new Syrian system, but no agreement has been reached.",
      "Protesters on Wednesday held banners openly accusing the Army of Islam and reading \u201cFreedom\u201d in English and \u201cTraitor who kidnaps a revolutionary\u201d in Arabic, alongside posters of the four missing activists.",
      "Saleh described the plight of the disappeared as uniquely painful, saying, \u201cThose who die are mourned, but the forcibly disappeared are forbidden from both living and being mourned.\u201d",
      "Their bodies must be found, he said, adding: \u201cFor Syria to heal, truth and justice must prevail.\u201d",
      "Wafa Moustafa, whose father was forcibly disappeared separately in 2013, also attended the protest.",
      "\u201cJustice in Syria cannot be limited to those detained by the Assad regime,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many years, other factions controlled parts of Syria and committed similar crimes of detention, torture and killing. If justice does not include all victims, it will remain incomplete and threaten Syria\u2019s future.\u201d",

      "In his homily, he prayed that everyone learns to care for \u201cevery child born of a woman\u201d and to protect \u201cthe precious gift of life: life in the womb, the lives of children, the lives of the suffering, the poor, the elderly, the lonely and the dying.\u201d",

      "In recent years, the Argentine Jesuit has been speaking out more emphatically about abortion than he did at the start of his pontificate.

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Louisville punter Brady Hodges said he opted out of the Sun Bowl this week because the Cardinals' NIL collective did not pay money promised to him in September.",
      "Hodges posted on social media during Tuesday's game against Washington in El Paso, Texas, that he had not been with the team since Dec. 10.",
      "\u201cI graduated on December 13th and had every intention on being with the team had they held up their end of the deal,\u201d Hodges wrote. He did not disclose how much money he is owed.",
      "Dan Furman, president of 502Circle, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "Hodges was Louisville's primary punter and holder for two seasons. Redshirt freshman Carter Schwartz took over those duties in the Cardinals' 35-34 Sun Bowl win. Schwartz averaged 43.7 yards on six punts, with two downed at the Washington 3-yard line and another at the Huskies 16.",
      "Matthew Sluka, starting quarterback for the UNLV football team, left the Rebels after three games in September because he was never paid a $100,000 NIL deal.

      "Aeromexico is the most on-time airline in the world, according to a data company that compiled figures for 2024",
      "Mexican airline Aeromexico had the world's best record for on-time arrivals in 2024, according to an annual ranking released Thursday. Delta Air Lines scored the highest among U.S. carriers despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Aviation-data provider Cirium said in a report that nearly 87% of Aeromexico flights arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival, a widely used measure of on-time performance among airlines.",
      "Saudia, the flagship carrier of Saudi Arabia, ranked second worldwide, with an on-time performance rate of just over 86%, according to Cirium.",
      "Cirium has rated airlines for timeliness for 16 years. CEO Jeremy Bowen said 2024 was a difficult year for airlines due to severe weather patterns and the summer technology outage. The winning airlines therefore deserved credit for getting most passengers to their destinations on time, Bowen said.",
      "Atlanta-based Delta achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",
      "Canada\u2019s WestJet, Air Canada and Denver-based budget airline Frontier finished at the bottom of the pack among U.S. and Canadian carriers, with on-time ratings below 72%.",
      "Other regional winners around the globe, according to Cirium, were Japan Airlines, low-cost Spanish carrier Iberia Express, Panama\u2019s Copa Airlines, and South African low-cost carrier FlySafair.",
      "Cirium said the best airport for on-time departures in 2024 was King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Nearly 87% of flights from there took off within 15 minutes of their scheduled time, Cirium said.",
      "Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima, Peru, and Mexico City's Benito Ju\u00e1rez International Airport had the next-best departure records at over 84%. Delta took the top spot among U.S. airlines despite disruptions in July from an outage that followed a faulty upgrade that cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike sent to Microsoft computers around the world.",
      "Delta sued CrowdStrike, claiming the outage cost the airline $500 million. CrowdStrike has defended itself partly by arguing that other airlines recovered much more quickly from the outage.",

      "\u201cThere are many challenges facing our island,\u201d she said in her first public address as governor as she acknowledged the blackout in a speech to a crowd gathered in front of the seaside Capitol. \u201cThat is precisely what moves me to address that first challenge with a sense of urgency.\u201d",
      "She pledged to improve Puerto Rico's infrastructure, hospitals and schools, adding that she intends to boost bilingual education.",

      "Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "While electricity had been restored to 99% of the utility's 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year\u2019s Day when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma.",
      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",

She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Supporters and critics gathered for the ceremony, some clutching umbrellas to shield themselves from the blistering sun.",
      "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s going to be a great governor,\u201d said Amanda S\u00e1nchez Le\u00f3n, a retired government employee, who arrived two hours early to secure a spot outside an area reserved for guests. She said she was hopeful that Gonz\u00e1lez would reduce violent crimes and improve education and health, \u201cespecially for us older people.\u201d She also believed the power crisis would improve and that Gonz\u00e1lez would see her promises through.",

      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",
      "\u201cStatehood means equality, and I want us to have that access to opportunities,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI want to have those opportunities here so that our people can move forward.\u201d"

      "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Opponents of the nation's largest lithium mine under construction want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project in Nevada already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail being considered for endangered species protection.",
      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

      "U.S. stock indexes are falling to start 2025",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes are falling Thursday to start 2025.",
      "The S&P 500 was down 0.6% in afternoon trading after rising as much as 0.9% earlier. It's coming off a four-day losing streak, its longest since early September, which dimmed the end of its stellar 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 264 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:04 p.m. Eastern time, after an earlier gain of 360 points disappeared. The Nasdaq composite was 0.7% lower.",
      "Tesla slumped after it disclosed it delivered fewer vehicles in the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected. The electric-vehicle company\u2019s stock fell 6.2%.",
      "Some Big Tech stocks, which have been leading Wall Street for most of the last few years, bucked the downward trend. Nvidia, whose chips are powering the world\u2019s move into artificial-intelligence technology, rose 1.6% after following up its nearly 240% surge in 2023 with a better than 170% jump last year.",
      "Some investors and analysts are counting on the AI rush to continue, even though critics say it\u2019s sent prices for some stocks too high too quickly. As the calendar flips to a new year, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says it\u2019s the \u201dsame tech playbook in year 3 of this tech AI driven bull market,\u201d for example.",
      "Such optimism, of course, can also make contrarians feel nervous.",
      "A measure of how heavily Wall Street analysts are recommending stocks is at its highest level since early 2022, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian. She says the measure has been a reliable contrarian indicator in the past, and it\u2019s just a bit shy of triggering a signal to sell for those who are leery when much of Wall Street rushes in the same direction.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.56% from 4.57% late Tuesday.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes fell 2.2% in Hong Kong and 2.7% in Shanghai after a survey of factory managers showed Chinese activity expanding at a slower pace in December. New orders, employment and business sentiment weakened.",
      "Upbeat talk by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a New Year\u2019s address did little to raise optimism among investors who are hoping for more aggressive action to support the world's second-largest economy and boost stock prices.",
      "\u201cWe have adopted a full range of policies to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development. China\u2019s economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory,\u201d Xi said in a New Year message, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.",
      "Stock indexes were mostly higher elsewhere in Asia and Europe.",
      "Commodity prices rallied. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 2.1% to $73.25, while Brent crude, the international standard, gained 1.8% to $76.02.",
      "Natural gas climbed 2.9%, and gold added 1.1% to $2,668.80 per ounce.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network, almost three years into Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of its neighbor",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of 2024 and almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country\u2019s pipeline network \u2014 set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union \u2014 to Europe, under a five-year agreement.",
      "Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit \u201cin the interest of national security.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses,\" Halushchenko said Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app. \"Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today.\u201d",
      "At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn \u201cadditional billions ... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens.\u201d However, he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.",
      "Gazprom said in a statement Wednesday it \u201chas no technical and legal possibility\u201d of sending gas through Ukraine, due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.",
      "Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.",
      "After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky.",
      "The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the United States filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.",
      "Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d",
      "Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023, according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.",
      "Gazprom halted supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine\u2019s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.",
      "Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova, which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.",
      "Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire, Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed.",
      "Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova\u2019s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said.",
      "In an online statement, the company urged residents to gather household members together in a single room, hang blankets over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters. It said some key facilities, including hospitals, were exempt from the cuts.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as fears mounted that the gas shortages could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, for decades dependent on Russian energy supplies.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force people in the separatist territory to travel to Moldova proper, seeking basic amenities to get through the harsh winter and placing further strain on resources.",
      "Moldova, Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.",
      "On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a win for those opposed to the Kremlin's policies. In a post on X, Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to \u201cblackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies,\" including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany.",
      "Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed Wednesday the end of gas flows via Ukraine \u201cwill drastically affect us all in the EU but not Russia.\u201d",
      "Fico, whose views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream, has previously criticized Kyiv's refusal to extend the transit deal, and threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine in response.",
      "Moscow can still send gas to Hungary, as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia, through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.",
      "The steady reduction of Russian gas supplies to European countries has also spurred them to hasten the integration of Ukraine\u2019s energy grids with its neighbors to the west.",
      "Last week, private Ukrainian energy utility DTEK said it had received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the U.S., delivered through a newly expanded network spanning six countries from Greece to Ukraine \u2014 a significant step in reducing regional dependence on Russian energy.",
      "Separately, overnight into New Year's Day, Russia launched a drone strike on Kyiv that left two people dead under the rubble of a damaged building, according to the city administration. At least six people were wounded across the Ukrainian capital, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.",
      "Russian shelling also killed a man and wounded two women in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, regional authorities reported.",

    "story": [
      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

    "story": [
      "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- On a frigid morning in Moldova\u2019s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with \u201cno heating, no light.\u201d",
      "His concerns aren\u2019t unfounded.",
      "On Jan. 1, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cI feel that we\u2019ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve \u2026 which worries me greatly,\u201d Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. \u201cPrice increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that\u2019s something entirely different.\u201d",
      "The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper.",
      "\u201cThere will be no heating, no light,\u201d Murzin added. \u201cWe are entering a very difficult year.\"",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a \u201cpotential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova\u2019s already-strained resources\u201d to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol.",
      "\u201cIt could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue\u201d ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said.",
      "The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,\u201d said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.\u201d",
      "After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy \"as a political weapon\u201d and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,\u201d he said.",
      "For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid, but we\u2019re happy that there\u2019s no snow and the temperatures aren\u2019t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I work from home and I\u2019ll be directly affected.\u201d",
      "She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, \u201cBut regarding power and gas, it\u2019s the first time we face this,\u201d she said.",
      "Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom\u2019s decision and said that the country has gas supplies \u201cfor the heating season\u201d and measures will be taken \u201cto ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,\u201d adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.\u201d",
      "Olga Rosca, an adviser to Sandu, told the AP that most of Moldova, excluding Transnistria, \u201cshouldn\u2019t see major disruptions\u201d and that \u201ccheaper electricity previously supplied from Transnistria will be replaced by more expensive imports from the EU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Transnistrian region, however, the situation will be much more serious,\u201d she said, \u201cand any crisis there will inevitably affect all of Moldova.\"",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast \u201chybrid war\u201d by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations.",
      "The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation to potentially recover \u201cstrategic assets that were forcefully taken over,\u201d referring to Moldovagaz, Moldova\u2019s main gas operator in which Gazprom owns a majority stake.",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz.",
      "In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant.",
      "When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets.",
      "Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits.",
      "\u201cI think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people will come here, hoping for warmth.\"",

      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",
      "It warned of store closures, saying the situation is \u201cclearly untenable.\u201d",
      "In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa\u2019s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had \u2018impaired\u201d its investment in Zimbabwe \u201cto a book value of zero\u201d because of the \u201cdeteriorating economic conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it\u2019s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,\u201d said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers\u2019 situation.",
      "\u201cEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don\u2019t care. They are there for survival,\u201d Mugano said.",
      "The contrast is palpable in Harare\u2019s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.",
      "Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.",
      "\u201cBusiness is booming,\u201d said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.",
      "Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.",
      "More than 80% of Zimbabwe\u2019s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.",

      "He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.",
      "\u201cI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I will do this more often.\u201d"

      "The Justice Department ordered the app's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban by Jan. 19, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court will take up the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has asked the Supreme Court for a delay.",
      "If a ban does occur, small businesses will have to migrate to other platforms to find their customers. Instagram Reels, SnapChat and YouTube Shorts are alternatives. The good news is brands likely already have a presence there. But it may be harder to reach teens that have made TikTok their preferred social media app.",

      "Companies still face a long list of uncertainties in the year ahead, including economic policy shifts, reheated inflation and shifts in the jobs market and consumer spending.",
      "Earnings for companies within the S&P 500 are expected to have grown by about 9.4% in 2024, according to FactSet. Companies will start reporting their final quarterly financial results for that year in the next few weeks. It will mark a sharp gain from 1.4% growth in 2023.",
      "Profit growth for companies followed the rising economic tide. The labor market remained strong, helping support consumer spending for goods and services. Prices remain high on many items and services, but the rate of inflation has eased significantly, helping companies lower costs in some cases and relieving some pressure on consumers.",

Trump has threatened blanket tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S., which in itself would raise prices for imported goods and raw materials for companies, which typically pass those costs along to consumers. Other nations would likely respond with retaliatory tariffs, which would almost certainly add to pressure on prices for businesses and consumers.",

      "Just over two years after the debut of ChatGPT, the world is getting a little savvier about what artificial intelligence technology can do for us and what it\u2019s not so great at",
      "If 2023 was a year of wonder about artificial intelligence, 2024 was the year to try to get that wonder to do something useful without breaking the bank.",
      "There was a \u201cshift from putting out models to actually building products,\u201d said Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton University computer science professor and co-author of the new book \u201cAI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can\u2019t, and How to Tell The Difference.\u201d",
      "The first 100 million or so people who experimented with ChatGPT upon its release two years ago actively sought out the chatbot, finding it amazingly helpful at some tasks or laughably mediocre at others.",
      "Now such generative AI technology is baked into an increasing number of technology services whether we're looking for it or not \u2014 for instance, through the AI-generated answers in Google search results or new AI techniques in photo editing tools.",
      "\u201cThe main thing that was wrong with generative AI last year is that companies were releasing these really powerful models without a concrete way for people to make use of them,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year is gradually building out these products that can take advantage of those capabilities and do useful things for people.\"",
      "At the same time, since OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023 and competitors introduced similarly performing AI large language models, these models have stopped getting significantly \u201cbigger and qualitatively better,\" resetting overblown expectations that AI was racing every few months to some kind of better-than-human intelligence, Narayanan said. That's also meant that the public discourse has shifted from \u201cis AI going to kill us?\u201d to treating it like a normal technology, he said.",
      "On quarterly earnings calls this year, tech executives often heard questions from Wall Street analysts looking for assurances of future payoffs from huge spending on AI research and development. Building AI systems behind generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini requires investing in energy-hungry computing systems running on powerful and expensive AI chips. They require so much electricity that tech giants announced deals this year to tap into nuclear power to help run them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of capital that has been poured into this technology,\u201d said Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan.",
      "Another analyst at the New York investment bank drew attention over the summer by arguing AI isn't solving the complex problems that would justify its costs. He also questioned whether AI models, even as they're being trained on much of the written and visual data produced over the course of human history, will ever be able to do what humans do so well. Rangan has a more optimistic view.",
      "\u201cWe had this fascination that this technology is just going to be absolutely revolutionary, which it has not been in the two years since the introduction of ChatGPT,\u201d Rangan said. \"It\u2019s more expensive than we thought and it\u2019s not as productive as we thought.\"",
      "Rangan, however, is still bullish about its potential and says that AI tools are already proving \u201cabsolutely incrementally more productive\u201d in sales, design and a number of other professions.",
      "Some workers wonder whether AI tools will be used to supplement their work or to replace them as the technology continues to grow. The tech company Borderless AI has been using an AI chatbot from Cohere to write up employment contracts for workers in Turkey or India without the help of outside lawyers or translators.",
      "Video game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists who went on strike in July said they feared AI could reduce or eliminate job opportunities because it could be used to replicate one performance into a number of other movements without their consent. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year\u2019s film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months. Game companies have also signed side agreements with the union that codify certain AI protections in order to keep working with actors during the strike.",
      "Musicians and authors have voiced similar concerns over AI scraping their voices and books. But generative AI still can't create unique work or \u201ccompletely new things,\u201d said Walid Saad, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and AI expert at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cWe can train it with more data so it has more information. But having more information doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cAs humans, we understand the world around us, right? We understand the physics. You understand if you throw a ball on the ground, it\u2019s going to bounce. AI tools currently don\u2019t understand the world.\u201d",
      "AI can mimic what it learns from patterns, he said, but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand the world so that they reason on what happens in the future.\u201d That, he said, is where AI falls short.",
      "\u201cIt still cannot imagine things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that imagination is what we hope to achieve later.\u201d",
      "Saad pointed to a meme about AI as an example of that shortcoming. When someone prompted an AI engine to create an image of salmon swimming in a river, he said, the AI created a photo of a river with cut pieces of salmon found in grocery stores.",
      "\u201cWhat AI lacks today is the common sense that humans have, and I think that is the next step,\u201d he said.",
      "That type of reasoning is a key part of the process of making AI tools more useful to consumers, said Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's innovation and incubation arm, Outshift. AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI \u201cagents\u201d that can do more useful things on people\u2019s behalf.",
      "That could mean being able to ask an AI agent an ambiguous question and have the model able to reason and plan out steps to solving an ambitious problem, Pandey said. A lot of technology, he said, is going to move in that direction in 2025.",
      "Pandey predicts that eventually, AI agents will be able to come together and perform a job the way multiple people come together and solve a problem as a team rather than simply accomplishing tasks as individual AI tools. The AI agents of the future will work as an ensemble, he said.",
      "Future Bitcoin software, for example, will likely rely on the use of AI software agents, Pandey said. Those agents will each have a specialty, he said, with \u201cagents that check for correctness, agents that check for security, agents that check for scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to an agentic future,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these agents being very good at certain skills, but also have a little bit of a character or color to them, because that\u2019s how we operate.\u201d",
      "AI tools have also streamlined, or lent in some cases a literal helping hand, to the medical field. This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry \u2014 one of two Nobels awarded to AI-related science \u2014 went to work led by Google that could help discover new medicines.",
      "Saad, the Virginia Tech professor, said that AI has helped bring faster diagnostics by quickly giving doctors a starting point to launch from when determining a patient's care. AI can't detect disease, he said, but it can quickly digest data and point out potential problem areas for a real doctor to investigate. As with other arenas, however, it poses a risk of perpetuating falsehoods.",
      "Tech giant OpenAI has touted its AI-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy,\u201d for example. But experts have said that Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences.",
      "Pandey, of Cisco, said that some of the company's customers who work in pharmaceuticals have noted that AI has helped bridge the divide between \u201cwet labs,\u201d in which humans conduct physical experiments and research, and \u201cdry labs\u201d where people analyze data and often use computers for modeling.",
      "When it comes to pharmaceutical development, that collaborative process can take several years, he said \u2014 with AI, the process can be cut to a few days.",
      "\"That, to me, has been the most dramatic use,\" Pandey said."

      "South Korean officials plan to conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a weekend plane crash that killed 179 people",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country\u2019s aircraft operation systems.",
      "\u201cThe essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\u201d said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \u201cproven airplane\u201d that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country\u2019s airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They said there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul\u2019s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",
      "Joo said officials were reviewing whether there might have been communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot. \u201cOur current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\u201d he said.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the plane\u2019s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\u201cI demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\u201d he said, choking down tears.",
      "The crash was yet more major news for South Koreans already reeling from a political crisis set off by Yoon\u2019s martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law inforcement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has led to concerns.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried whether the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\u201d the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial Monday."

      "WASHINGTON -- A machinists strike. Another safety problem involving its troubled top-selling airliner. A plunging stock price.",
      "2024 was already a dispiriting year for Boeing, the American aviation giant. But when one of the company's jets crash-landed in South Korea on Sunday, killing all but two of the 181 people on board, it brought to a close an especially unfortunate year for Boeing.",
      "The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and aviation experts were quick to distinguish Sunday's incident from the company\u2019s earlier safety problems.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines who is now a consultant, said it would be inappropriate to link the incident Sunday to two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. In January this year, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 that crash-landed in Korea, Price noted, is \u201ca very proven airplane. \"It\u2019s different from the Max ...It\u2019s a very safe airplane.\u2019\u2019",
      "For decades, Boeing has maintained a role as one of the giants of American manufacturing. But the the past year's repeated troubles have been damaging. The company's stock price is down more than 30% in 2024.",
      "The company's reputation for safety was especially tarnished by the 737 Max crashes, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and left a combined 346 people dead. In the five years since then, Boeing has lost more than $23 billion. And it has fallen behind its European rival, Airbus, in selling and delivering new planes.",
      "Last fall, 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike, crippling the production of the 737 Max, the company's bestseller, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane. The walkout lasted seven weeks, until members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to an offer that included 38% pay raises over four years.",
      "In January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. Federal regulators responded by imposing limits on Boeing aircraft production that they said would remain in place until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max. Acting on Boeing\u2019s incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from Airbus instead. (Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to argue that Boeing\u2019s deception had played a role in the crashes.)",
      "But the plea deal was rejected this month by a federal judge in Texas, Reed O\u2019Connor, who decided that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in choosing an official to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Boeing has sought to change its culture. Under intense pressure over safety issues, David Calhoun departed as CEO in August. Since January, 70,000 Boeing employees have participated in meetings to discuss ways to improve safety."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters.",
      "Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That\u2019s why we have them,\" Trump said.",
      "In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a \u201cHire American\u201d policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday.",
      "\u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program,\" Trump told the newspaper.",
      "He did not appear to address questions about whether he would pursue any changes to the number or use of the visas once he takes office Jan. 20.",
      "Trump's hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters.",
      "But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump's movement have accused Musk and others in Trump's new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\" vision.",
      "Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated."

      "Columbus, Ohio-based Big Lots sells furniture, home decor and other items. When it filed for bankruptcy in September, it said inflation and high interest rates caused consumers to pull back on their purchases of home and seasonal products, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue.",
      "At the time, Big Lots planned to sell its assets and ongoing business operations to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management.",
      "But on Dec. 20, Big Lots said the deal with Nexus didn't materialize. It then partnered with Gordon Brothers to conduct going-out-of-business sales at its 869 U.S. locations."

      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",

      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "Liverpool vs",
      "MANCHESTER, England -- Liverpool vs. Manchester United used to be English soccer's fiercest rivalry. Sunday's showdown at Anfield pits two teams going in opposite directions.",
      "Liverpool, top of the Premier League and the Champions League, has its sights on equalling United 's record 20 Premier League titles and more. Liverpool has lost to United just once in seven years in the Premier League, and most recently won 3-0 at Old Trafford in September.",
      "United is closer to the relegation zone than the top in another calamitous campaign which has seen the departure of a manager, a sporting director and the exile of one of its leading players.",
      "The gap between Liverpool and United is widening to the point where one is in contention for a quadruple of trophies and the other is talking about top flight survival.",
      "How have English soccer\u2019s two most successful teams ended up on such differing paths?",
      "United has been in alarming decline since winning a record 20th title in Alex Ferguson's final season as manager in 2013. It hasn't come close to winning another since his retirement. Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent manager hired in the last 11-plus years.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag all failed to deliver consistent success and the upheaval from so much managerial change has repeatedly set back United as the club has lurched from one direction to another.",
      "Amorim has quickly realized the size of the job after six defeats in his last eight games. This week he admitted he could be in a relegation fight.",
      "\u201cIt is a possibility,\" he said. \"We have to be clear with our fans.\u201d",
      "While United has made a mess of trying to replace a managerial great, Liverpool has made it look easy.",
      "Arne Slot took on the unenviable task of filling the void left by J\u00fcrgen Klopp at the end of last season and has driven the team to new levels.",
      "Klopp won a full set of trophies at Anfield and was denied much more success in the Premier League than just the 2020 title only by Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.",
      "Slot has Liverpool leading the Premier League by six points with a game in hand, the Champions League by three points, and through to the semifinals of the English League Cup.",
      "Perhaps he has been fortunate to take over when City has gone into freefall but Liverpool's 14 wins from 18 games in the league would be title-challenging form in any season.",
      "Billions have been spent at United yet there have been more costly errors than transfer successes.",
      "Superstar signings such as Angel di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba, Casemiro and Jadon Sancho have proved to be big disappointments. From the last transfer window, signees such as Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt have struggled.",
      "Amorim is likely to have to sell in January if he wants to bring more players in and Marcus Rashford, recently dropped from the team, could be his best chance of raising funds.",
      "Conversely, Liverpool has been one of the savviest operators in the transfer market over the past decade. When it has spent big, it has generally spent well, with the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson proving pillars of its trophy haul. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were relative bargains.",
      "Under Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American conglomerate that also owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool became a major force in England and Europe again and ended a 30-year title drought in the Premier League.",
      "The hiring of Klopp was pivotal to that but so was Michael Edwards, the sporting director who was integral to so many transfer successes. He left in 2022 but is back as FSG chief executive of football and helped to guide the transition to Slot.",
      "United's American owner, the Glazer family, has faced regular fan protests since its leveraged buyout of the club in 2005.",
      "The minority investment by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe last year sparked optimism. He assumed control of the club's soccer operations but that hasn't gone to plan so far.",
      "Ten Hag was fired months after signing a contract extension and sporting director Dan Ashworth departed after less than six months. The signings in Ratcliffe's first summer transfer window also look questionable with United 14th in the standings and just seven points above the relegation zone.",
      "Liverpool is enjoying an outstanding campaign with big issues to be resolved.",
      "Salah, Van Dijk and Trent Alexander Arnold are out of contract after this season. Salah and Van Dijk are in their 30s and in dispute is the length of contract Liverpool is prepared to offer them. Alexander Arnold, meanwhile, is reportedly a target for Real Madrid.",
      "Amorim's immediate concern is how to turn around United's form. Long term, his squad looks ill-suited to his preferred system.",

Long hours of gym/rehab time but it\u2019s coming along and I\u2019m so happy with that. Hoping to work into some easy turns on snow in the next week or so.",

      "Keleti died Thursday morning in Budapest, the Hungarian state news agency reported. She was hospitalized in critical condition with pneumonia on Dec. 25.",
      "She won a total of 10 Olympic medals in gymnastics, including five golds, for Hungary at the 1952 Helsinki Games and the 1956 Melbourne Games. She overcame the loss of her father and several relatives in the Holocaust to become one of the most successful Jewish Olympic athletes.",
      "\u201cThese 100 years felt to me like 60,\u201d Keleti told The Associated Press on the eve of her 100th birthday. \u201cI live well. And I love life. It\u2019s great that I\u2019m still healthy.\u201d",
      "Born \u00c1gnes Klein in 1921 in Budapest, her career was interrupted by World War II and the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics. Forced off her gymnastics team in 1941 because of her Jewish ancestry, Keleti went into hiding in the Hungarian countryside, where she survived the Holocaust by assuming a false identity and working as a maid.",
      "Her mother and sister survived the war with the help of famed Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, but her father and other relatives perished at Auschwitz, among the more than half a million Hungarian Jews killed in Nazi death camps and by Hungarian Nazi collaborators.",
      "Resuming her career after the war, Keleti was set to compete at the 1948 London Olympics, but a last-minute ankle injury dashed her hopes.",
      "Four years later, she made her Olympic debut at the 1952 Helsinki Games at the age of 31, winning a gold medal in the floor exercise as well as a silver and two bronzes. In 1956, she became the most successful athlete at the Melbourne Olympics, winning four gold and two silver medals.",
      "While she was becoming the oldest gold medalist in gymnastics history at age 35 in Melbourne, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary following an unsuccessful anti-Soviet uprising. Keleti remained in Australia and sought political asylum. She then immigrated to Israel the following year and worked as a trainer and coached the Israeli Olympic gymnastics team until the 1990s."

      "Golf is moving indoors like never before",
      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Xander Schauffele is making his season debut twice in the span of seven days at venues separated by a lot more than some 5,000 miles.",
      "One is at The Sentry, the season opener on the PGA Tour that starts Thursday on hilly terrain in Maui with endless views of the Pacific Ocean. Schauffele knows what to expect at Kapalua having won the tournament six years ago with a 62 in the final round.",
      "The other starts next Tuesday inside a 250,000-square-foot building on the campus of Palm Beach State College, a technological wonder when it comes to golf and a game that will only look familiar because of the players involved.",
      "This one makes Schauffele curiously excited.",
      "It's the debut of the TMRW Golf League, a six-team league featuring Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy among 24 players \u2014 13 of them major champions \u2014 in fast-paced, two-hour matches to be televised in prime time on ESPN platforms.",
      "\u201cI've been in there twice and played a mock match, and there was still a wow factor \u2014 even the second time around with lights and the stadium and really big screens,\u201d said Schauffele, who plays for New York Golf Club.",
      "\u201cIt's different from what they'll see from a conventional standpoint.\u201d",
      "It's team golf played indoors in the SoFi Center, a combination of simulator golf and actual shots to a huge putting surface that can rotate 360 degrees to change angles and slopes for different shots.",
      "New York takes on The Bay Golf Club (San Francisco) in the opener Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST. Three players from the four-man teams compete in 15-hole matches \u2014 nine holes of alternate shot and six holes of singles, with each player going two holes.",

      "Players hit off real grass (or sand, the same used in bunkers at Augusta National) from 35 yards away into a screen 64 feet wide and 53 feet high. Architects have pitched in to design 30 holes that will be used at given times during the competition. For shots 50 yards or closer, players hit actual shots into the green.",
      "The TV window is two hours, and the competition includes a 40-second shot clock. This should move quickly, another element that sets it apart from traditional golf.",
      "\u201cIt's nothing like we've ever seen before, especially in golf,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "\u201cI see this as being complementary to everything else that is going on in the world of golf,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm still a traditionalist in a lot of ways. ... But I think there are certain things that we can do to innovate and try to appeal to a different and younger demographic, especially trying to condense it into a time frame that is a little bit more digestible and putting it on at a time where we\u2019re maybe going to get a few more eyeballs.\u201d",
      "TGL is a year behind schedule. It was supposed to debut at the start of 2024 until a power outage caused damage to the inflatable dome structure. With another year to plan, organizers went with a permanent arena that features locker rooms, dazzling lights and the massive screen. Electronic boards on both sides of the screen show the score, shot clock and yardages.",
      "The entire playing area is nearly the size of a football field.",
      "Simulator golf? Billy Horschel (Atlanta Drive GC) says that makes it sound like a gimmick, and he says TGL is more than that.",
      "\u201cWe're hitting off real grass, we\u2019re hitting real shots. We\u2019re playing on some artificial surface, but there\u2019s a lot of technology that\u2019s gone into this,\u201d Horschel said. \"We want to make it different than what people are seeing on the golf course. This is supposed to be different. It\u2019s supposed to be new, it\u2019s supposed to be fast, engaging, in a two-hour window when you\u2019re going to be able to see every golf shot.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to see guys more engaging than they would be on a PGA Tour event.\u201d",
      "Players will wear microphones. They will be presented with yardage and wind conditions before each shot. Winning a hole is worth one point (no carryovers for a halve).",
      "The six teams are Atlanta Drive, New York, Los Angeles, The Bay (San Francisco), Boston Common and Jupiter Links.",
      "Team ownership has power brokers that include Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank (Atlanta Drive), Fenway Sports Group (Boston), Stephen Curry and former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry (Bay) and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen (New York). Serena and Venus Williams are part owners of Los Angeles.",

      "\u201cIt gives a chance for a different perspective on people watching PGA Tour players,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be more personable, more action-packed.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Hield said. \u201cIt\u2019s not by chance. I\u2019ve put the work in, for sure. I\u2019m just blessed and honored to be in this position.\u201d",
      "Hield is averaging 12.6 points and shooting nearly 43% from the field with the Warriors, but he also is making his presence felt off the court.",
      "When Hield arrives anywhere with the Warriors, he offers his hellos with that signature smile and instantly lifts the spirits of his new team. It's the kind of joy and focus coach Steve Kerr has long insisted defines the Warriors franchise.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing even-keel about him, he is all extreme happy, joy, talking all the time, and you love that energy because he loves the game,\u201d Curry said. \u201c... He does bring joy to the locker room, to the plane. No matter where we\u2019re at, you\u2019re going to hear him and he lifts everybody up because he\u2019s got a great sense of humor and he\u2019s been around the block. The funniest part is you just can\u2019t get him to shut up. So you appreciate everything he brings.\u201d",
      "His teammates call him Buddy Love, Buddy Fresh and Buddy Buckets \u2014 the nickname Buddy has been with the shooting guard since just after his birth, as Hield's formal first name is Chavano.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve just got to keep moving and hopefully I\u2019m able to catch some of the greats,\" Hield said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to catch Steph, but I hope to catch some of the greats and hopefully I can crack top-10, maybe top-five.\u201d",

      "The Warriors (16-16) have been struggling lately, losing three of their last 10.",
      "But you won't hear complaints from Hield, who has enjoyed an impressive run \u2014 from shooting as a youngster on a makeshift hoop that he and his brother Chevez constructed from a milk crate to helping lead Oklahoma to a Final Four in college and now as a journeyman in his ninth NBA season with a fifth different team.",
      "\"Where I came from in the Bahamas, I couldn\u2019t write a better script than this, just being down there, shooting on an outside court, building my own court right from a crate. To have 2,000 3s, I know the young kids back home and the people that helped me get to this point will really appreciate that.",
      "\"So I\u2019m just blessed to be in this situation.\u201d",
      "Hield landed with Golden State following Klay Thompson\u2019s departure to Dallas, and it's something Bahamas teammate Thompson called \u201cvery special.\u201d",
      "\"I\u2019m just happy they replaced me with another Bahamian,\u201d he said.",
      "And Thompson certainly realizes what Hield means to the Bahamas and helping build basketball back home.",
      "\u201cAre you kidding me? He\u2019s a legend, especially around Freeport. Buddy gives young men and women hope all over the nation,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEspecially his commitment to the national team, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d",
      "Hield's shooting has been inconsistent, but the Warriors are seeing everything he brings on and off the court. And that doesn't waver whether he's hitting shots or missing them, or starting or coming off the bench.",

      "Howard passed for 319 yards, Emeka Egbuka also caught a long TD pass and TreVeyon Henderson made a 66-yard touchdown run in a redemptive Rose Bowl for the Buckeyes (12-2, CFP No. 8 seed), whose big-game execution sometimes hasn't matched their formidable talent this season.",
      "Ohio State has seized the second chances created by the first 12-team CFP, emphatically blowing out the tournament's No. 1 seed. The Buckeyes scored on six of their first seven drives and took a 34-0 lead late in the second quarter on the nation\u2019s only remaining unbeaten team in the Granddaddy of Them All.",
      "Ohio State is headed to the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 10 to face No. 4 Texas for a berth in the national title game. The Longhorns barely advanced earlier Wednesday, holding off Arizona State 39-31 in a double-overtime Peach Bowl.",
      "Dillon Gabriel passed for 299 yards and hit Traeshon Holden for two touchdowns for the Ducks (13-1, CFP No. 1 seed), whose dreams of their first national title were flattened on the famed Rose Bowl turf. Oregon's 14-game winning streak also ended.",
      "Eleven days after routing Tennessee to open the Playoff, Ohio State dominated this rematch of these Big Ten teams\u2019 regular-season thriller, won 32-31 by the Ducks in Eugene on Oct. 12. The Ohio State defense that couldn\u2019t sack Gabriel in the teams\u2019 first meeting dropped the Heisman Trophy finalist eight times in the rematch.",
      "Smith, the Buckeyes' standout freshman playmaker, had a remarkable bowl debut with seven receptions for 187 yards \u2014 including five catches for 161 yards in the first half alone, hauling in scoring passes of 45 and 43 yards.",
      "Ohio State turned the CFP\u2019s most anticipated quarterfinal matchup into a long celebration at the Rose Bowl, which has hosted several thrilling, close games in recent Januaries. This one pitted two powerhouse programs widely considered to have the top two teams left in the inaugural 12-team Playoff, but the Buckeyes scored early and often at the Rose Bowl.",
      "The Big Ten champion Ducks couldn\u2019t make any offensive headway until they trailed by 34 points, failing to create any of the big plays that carried the Ducks to victory in Eugene.",
      "After the usual pregame pageantry in 70-degree sunshine at the venerable stadium in Arroyo Seco, Ohio State needed just three plays and 49 seconds to strike first. Howard threw a short play-action screen pass to Smith, who motored through Oregon\u2019s secondary for a 45-yard score.",
      "On the Buckeyes\u2019 third drive, Howard feathered an exceptional long pass over three Ducks to the sprinting Egbuka for a 42-yard TD. Howard finished the first quarter with a career-best 212 yards passing, surpassing his 160 yards during Ohio State\u2019s hot start against Tennessee.",
      "Early in the second quarter, Smith got so open near the Ducks\u2019 goal line that he had two seconds to settle under Howard\u2019s long throw like an outfielder with a fly ball, scoring a 42-yard TD untouched.",
      "When Henderson broke a 66-yard TD run down the Oregon sideline for a 31-0 lead, both sides of the Rose Bowl stands rippled with disbelief.",
      "Oregon finally got moving on its final drive before halftime. Gabriel found Holden for a 5-yard TD pass at the gun, and the Ducks added a two-point conversion to salvage something from their horrific half.",
      "The Ducks drove for Noah Whittington\u2019s 2-yard TD run to open the second half, scoring the first touchdown allowed in the third quarter all season by Ohio State. Oregon even forced a punt moments later to stir faint hope in its fans, but the Ohio State defense drove the Buckeyes backward for a punt before Howard\u2019s group methodically drove for Henderson\u2019s second TD.",
      "Ohio State: The full force of the Buckeyes' talent has been on display for the past two weeks after it fell short against Oregon and Michigan in the regular season. The 12-team playoff opened the chance for redemption. This group is seizing it, and it's awfully fun to watch.",
      "Oregon: Having 3 1/2 weeks off with their first-round bye proved to be dangerous for the Ducks. This disconcerting flop doesn't completely ruin a breakthrough Big Ten debut, but the season will always loom as a missed opportunity in Oregon history.",
      "Ohio State: The Cotton Bowl will be a preview of both teams\u2019 2025 season opener, since Texas visits Ohio Stadium on Aug. 30.",
      "Oregon: The 2025 season opener is at home against Montana State, which faces North Dakota State in the FCS title game Monday night.",

      "HOUSTON -- Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair said he was in a \u201creally dark place\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d ever play football again in the days after he was suspended for three games for his hit on Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence that left the quarterback with a concussion.",
      "Speaking to reporters Wednesday for the first time since the suspension, Al-Shaair discussed his state of mind during his absence.",
      "\u201cThe things that you can think when somebody says they\u2019re in a dark place, as dark as you can go is where I was truthfully,\u201d he said.",
      "Al-Shaair added that \u201cit was hard for me to see myself playing football again\u201d before he met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and league executives Troy Vincent and Jon Runyan.",
      "Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair in what escalated into a brawl.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field after being ejected, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet.",
      "Al-Shaair said that he understood the suspension, but disagreed with how he was characterized by Runyan in the letter informing him of the punishment. It included Runyan telling Al-Shaair: \u201cYour lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach, and enjoy watching it, is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL.\u201d",
      "He said he needed to talk to Runyan and other NFL executives to understand how they viewed him as a player before he could return to the field.",
      "\u201cI really had a moment of, there\u2019s no way I can go out and play football again if this is how people that I work with view me,\u201d Al-Shaair said.",
      "He said Runyan told him that he was watching the play and the ensuing melee when he wrote the letter and that he was only referring to those moments and not his entire career in his comments about his sportsmanship.",
      "\u201cBut the way he typed it, he said got obviously taken out of context,\u201d Al-Shaair said. \u201cI clearly made a mistake (and) the reason why he typed something which ended up being taken out of context as a mistake is because I did something that was obviously not right, me taking my helmet off and me starting another brawl ... wasn\u2019t right.",
      "\u201cBut everything prior to that I stand on the fact that I never tried to hurt him,\u201d he continued.",
      "Al-Shaair said he sat in a room not doing anything for about five days after his suspension.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a blur,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat nothing. I didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d",
      "By Friday of that week, some children at a foster care organization in Tennessee that he had met last year when he played for the Titans sent him messages of encouragement.",
      "\u201cI got so many different messages like that and I remember just sitting in my bed and I was like: \u2018Man, like I can just keep sitting here sad and sulking and just feeling like I\u2019m being misjudged or I can just do what I always do, which is just try to be positive and spread positivity, do the best that I can,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He booked a plane ticket to Nashville and got there in time to attend the same event at the foster care organization that he\u2019d attended the previous year.",
      "\u201cI had so many people saying so many negative things and to see people that were happy to see me and were happy about my presence I think that\u2019s what kind of like snapped me back,\u201d Al-Shaair said. \u201cLike regardless of what\u2019s being said, you know who you are and just lean into that and ... from there just crawling myself out of this place.\u201d",
      "When the AFC South champion Texans (9-7) face the Titans on Sunday, he'll return for the first time since the hit on Lawrence, and coach DeMeco Ryans is thrilled to have him back. The Texans have been hit hard by injuries and are limping into the playoffs after two straight losses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve missed him over these past three weeks, just missed his presence, his leadership, missed his playmaking ability on the field,\u201d Ryans said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re excited to get him back out there and let him knock some of the rust off.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- The Peach Bowl referee declined to call a targeting penalty late in the fourth quarter for a helmet-to-helmet hit by Texas safety Michael Taaffe that could've given Arizona State a chance to kick a winning field goal in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals Wednesday.",
      "The fourth-ranked Longhorns went on to beat the No. 10 Sun Devils 39-31 in double overtime after Texas squandered a 16-point lead in the final period of regulation.",
      "The big hit by Taaffe came after Texas missed a field goal attempt with 1:39 remaining that left the game tied at 24-all. Taking over, Arizona State faced third-and-15 from its own 38 when Sam Leavitt delivered a short pass over the middle to Melquan Stovall.",
      "Taaffe arrived about the time Stovall made the 10-yard reception, their helmets clearly hitting, and the Arizona State receiver was left sprawled on the turf.",
      "No flag was thrown, but referee Larry Smith of the Big Ten conference halted play to check the replay for possible targeting. As Stovall was being helped off the field, Smith announced there was no penalty, leaving Arizona State with fourth-and-5 at its own 48.",
      "If targeting had been called, a 15-yard penalty would have given the Sun Devils a first down at the Texas 37. Instead, they punted the ball away.",
      "Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham argued with the officials on the sideline. It was clear he didn't agree with the call after one of his own players, star defensive back Shamari Simmons, had to sit out the first half after being ejected from the Big 12 championship game for a targeting penalty.",
      "Texas took advantage of Simmons' replacement, Montana Warren, to hit two long passes for a touchdown on its opening possession.",
      "\u201cI'm going to be honest, I don't know what targeting is,\u201d Dillingham said. \u201cWe lost one of our best players in the first half for targeting, and I just don't know what it is.\u201d",
      "Targeting generally refers to a player delivering a hit while leading with the crown of his helmet. While Taaffe's helmet undoubtedly hit Stovall's, it didn't appear the Texas player lowered his head.",
      "Dillingham said he's baffled by the targeting rule.",
      "\u201cI don't want to comment on something that I have to get a better grasp on what it is,\" the coach said. \u201cI just don't quite understand it. I do want to protect the players, though. So whatever rules are put in place to protect the players, I'm all about it.\u201d",

      "If the Denver Broncos are embracing the opportunity to face Carson Wentz instead of Patrick Mahomes on Sunday, they're not saying so publicly",
      "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The Denver Broncos aren't necessarily breathing any easier knowing they won't have to face Patrick Mahomes and several other Kansas City Chiefs starters on Sunday with a playoff berth on the line.",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid announced his decision to rest Mahomes on Wednesday, but declined to say who else might spend the day with the three-time Super Bowl MVP on the sideline in Denver with Kansas City having already secured the AFC's top seed.",
      "There's a good chance, though, that superstar defensive tackle Chris Jones (strained calf) will sit this one out. And the same could go for running back Isiah Pacheco (bruised ribs), right tackle Jawaan Taylor (sore knee) and veteran tight end Travis Kelce, who similarly skipped last year\u2019s Week 18 game, among others.",
      "\u201cWe have to play the game to win, that's all that matters,\u201d Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton said. \u201cWe don't care about none of the other stuff. Whoever has on shoulder pads and is wearing red, white and yellow, we have to beat them boys.",
      "\u201cWe don't care who shows up and plays,\u201d Sutton continued. \u201cWe don't care who sits. We don't care who doesn't play, who does play. We don't care about any of that. The Denver Broncos have to show up Sunday and win the game.\u201d",
      "If they do, the Broncos (9-7) will clinch a playoff berth for the first time since winning Super Bowl 50 in Peyton Manning's final game on Feb. 7. 2016.",
      "The franchise has churned through half a dozen coaches and more than a dozen starting quarterbacks since hoisting the team's third Lombardi Trophy nearly nine years ago.",
      "The Chiefs (15-1) won three games in an 11-day stretch culminating with a 29-10 win at Pittsburgh on Christmas Day that secured the conference's first-round bye as they seek a three-peat as Super Bowl champions. Reid is using the finale as a chance to rest some of his starters, who will have more than a three-week break by the time they return to the field for an AFC divisional-round game on either Jan. 18 or 19.",
      "\u201cYou know, a credit to Kansas City, Andy and his team,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cWhen you go 15-1, then you're afforded those decisions and I've been in that position where your team might need a break here or there. They've earned that and that's part of the deal. For us, it's about understanding what we're seeing scheme-wise and being ready to play our best game.\u201d",
      "The Broncos blew chances to wrap up a playoff berth with road losses to the Los Angeles Chargers and Cincinnati Bengals the last two weeks. But they're embracing the moment as they control their own destiny with a win-and-in game at home Sunday.",
      "\u201cYou could say that it would have been nice to be able to go into this game and have your position locked in,\u201d Sutton said, \u201cbut in terms of a storybook thing that you couldn't really write up any better, I think this is the best opportunity that we could have to go in and solidify why we deserve to be in the dance.\u201d",
      "The Broncos could back into the playoffs even if they lose to the Chiefs or tie them Sunday if Cincinnati loses to Pittsburgh on Saturday and the Miami Dolphins lose to the New York Jets on Sunday.",
      "They're not relying on anybody else punching their playoff ticket, though.",
      "\u201cWe gotta win the game, simple,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThere's nothing that goes into it. We gotta win the game. People say it's never black and white \u2014 it's black and white. We gotta win the game. And that's as simple as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Broncos snapped a 16-game losing streak to the Chiefs with a 24-9 win in Denver last season, and they were on the verge of beating Kansas City in Week 10 at Arrowhead Stadium when the Chiefs blocked a 33-yard field goal as time expired to preserve a 16-14 victory.",
      "In the aftermath of that heartbreaker, the Broncos flipped Alex Forsyth and Matt Peart on the left side of their field goal protection unit. Kicker Wil Lutz has gone 12 of 12 on field goals and 22 of 22 on extra points since then.",

      "Skattebo led the Sun Devils back from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter and put his team ahead for the first time all day with a 3-yard touchdown run to start overtime against No. 4 Texas (13-2).",
      "No. 10 Arizona State \u2014 a two-touchdown underdog according to BetMGM Sportsbook \u2014 was on the verge of winning when Texas faced fourth-and-13 on its first overtime possession. But Quinn Ewers found Matthew Golden breaking free behind two defenders to haul in a 28-yard touchdown.",
      "After moving to the opposite end of Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Ewers threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Gunnar Helms on the very next play, followed by a 2-point conversion pass to Golden.",
      "The Longhorns finally put Arizona State (11-3) away when Mukuba picked off Sam Leavitt's pass at the 3 to end the game.",

      "Despite being dominated on the stat sheet most of the game, the Longhorns had a seemingly comfortable 24-8 lead after scoring two early touchdowns and getting a 5-yard scoring run from Ewers with just over 10 minutes remaining.",
      "But Skattebo and the Sun Devils were just getting warmed up.",
      "The running back who calls himself the best in the nation, Skattebo backed up his bravado with a performance for the ages, showing every facet of his all-around game.",
      "First, he took a pitch on fourth-and-2 and heaved a 42-yard touchdown pass to Malik McClain that gave the Sun Devils a chance when they made the 2-point conversion.",
      "Then, Skattebo broke loose down the sideline and hauled in a 62-yard throw from Leavitt \u2014 getting his helmet ripped off at the end of the play, which seemed like the only way to bring him down.",
      "That set up a 2-yard touchdown run by the bowling ball of a back, and it was only appropriate that Skattebo also powered in for the 2-point conversion that tied the game at 24 with 5 minutes remaining.",

      "Coach Sean McVay announced the decision Wednesday to rest Stafford, the 16-year veteran starter. The Rams haven't decided which additional starters will rest.",
      "Los Angeles (10-6) has clinched the NFC West title over the Seahawks (9-7) based on strength of schedule. The Rams are currently the third seed in the NFC playoff bracket, but they will fall to fourth if they lose to Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-7) beat Atlanta to win the South division.",
      "The wild-card seeding is still in flux among Minnesota, Washington and Green Bay, so McVay clearly doesn't care whether the Rams enter the postseason as the third or fourth seed.",
      "Garoppolo has yet to play for the Rams since signing to be Stafford's backup last spring. The 33-year-old veteran who led San Francisco to Super Bowl 54, missed the first two games of his first season in Los Angeles under suspension for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancing drug policy.",

His 3,762 yards passing and 20 touchdown passes are his fewest in a season in which he played at least 15 games, but Stafford's eight interceptions are also his fewest in a nearly-full season, while his completion rate (65.8 percent) is above his career average.",
      "Stafford improved to 13-1 as a starter in Rams games played in December when Los Angeles held off Arizona 13-9 last Saturday, but his offense has been in a slump. The Rams have scored more than 21 points just once during their current five-game winning streak, and they've managed just three touchdowns in their past three games combined.",

    "summary": "The Washington Commanders are in the playoffs in their first season with general manager Adam Peters, coach Dan Quinn and quarterback Jayden Daniels",
    "story": [
      "The Washington Commanders are in the playoffs in their first season with general manager Adam Peters, coach Dan Quinn and quarterback Jayden Daniels",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Moments after the Washington Commanders finished the 2023 season at 4-13 and locked up the second pick in the draft, Daron Payne was already feeling optimistic about the organization's long-term future.",
      "In fact, the standout defensive tackle was bullish about success coming much quicker.",
      "\u201cYou see it around the NFL,\u201d Payne said on Jan. 7. \"Just last year, the Houston Texans, man, they was horrible. Now, look at them. They\u2019re a playoff team. All it takes is a couple pieces. A couple pieces, a couple good players and just start a run.\u201d",
      "Steps away from his locker stall, 357 days later, new coach Dan Quinn called over new general manager Adam Peters to celebrate the Commanders completing an improbable turnaround. Peters held a game ball from Washington's 30-24 overtime victory in his hand and addressed controlling owner Josh Harris.",
      "\u201cThere's no better gift that you can give a man on his 60th birthday than a playoff berth,\u201d Peters said, handing the ball to Harris while players cheered.",
      "\u201cThank you guys for everything,\u201d Harris exclaimed. \u201cPlayoffs!\"",
      "Jan. 11, 12 or 13 at Tampa Bay, Philadelphia or the Los Angeles Rams will be just Washington's seventh playoff game this century, and it comes in Jayden Daniels' breakout rookie season after taking the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback with the No. 2 pick.",
      "\u201cThe fan base waited a long time for this,\u201d Daniels said after leading another comeback victory. \u201cI really can\u2019t put into words how much it means to them and how much it means to me to be able to go out there and lead this franchise and this team to opportunities like that.\u201d",
      "Payne maybe had a premonition. Super Bowl champion tight end Zach Ertz agreed to join the Commanders in early March long before Daniels was drafted and even before veteran QB Marcus Mariota signed as a free agent.",
      "After Harris and ownership put Peters in charge of football operations, then they collaborated to hire Quinn, Kliff Kingsbury was brought in to run the offense and Joe Whitt Jr. the defense.",
      "\u201cI knew with the staff that they were building that we were going to have a chance,\u201d Ertz said.",
      "Following Ertz to Washington were six-time All-Pro Bobby Wagner and fellow linebackers Frankie Luvu and Dante Fowler, safety Jeremy Chinn, running back Austin Ekeler, defensive end Dorance Armstrong and offensive linemen Nick Allegretti, Tyler Biadasz.",
      "\u201cWe started bringing in veterans who I played against my whole life that a lot of them have torched us our whole life: Zach Ertz, Bobby Wagner \u2014 all these guys,\u201d punter Tress Way said.",
      "With Peters turning over more than half the 90-man training camp roster, gelling was important.",
      "\u201cEverybody had to get to know each other,\u201d said Wagner, who won the Super Bowl with Seattle when Quinn was defensive coordinator there. \u201cEverybody had to kind of build that camaraderie. And I think we did that really fast. There was a lot of guys that bought into the culture, bought into the people around them, had confidence in the people around them.\u201d",
      "Spring workouts allowed for that and helped the light bulb go off for Way, the team's longest-tenured player who endured a lot of losing over his decade in the league. He gave up his number to Daniels so the new face of the franchise could wear the same No. 5 on his chest that he did at Arizona State and LSU.",
      "There were no regrets.",
      "\u201cThe first time I saw \u20185\u2019 throw the football, I just thought, \u2018Well, let\u2019s play some ball and see what happens,'\u201d Way said.",
      "Daniels was not anointed the starter when he arrived, nor at the beginning of training camp. It took a couple of preseason games before Quinn made that declaration.",
      "\u201cNothing\u2019s ever been given to anyone on this team,\u201d Ertz said. \u201cEven Jayden, they made him earn it throughout training camp, throughout the offseason. And that stuff doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by players like myself who have been in the league for 12 years.\u201d",
      "Daniels lost his NFL debut, then led the Commanders on a four-game winning streak and victories in seven of the next eight while gutting through a rib injury, including a Hail Mary touchdown throw to beat Chicago among his many spectacular moments.",
      "\u201cHis poise, him being able to stay calm in the pocket in pressure situations, you don\u2019t get that from a lot of rookie quarterbacks,\u201d receiver Jamison Crowder said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad, man, that he\u2019s on my team.\"",
      "The Commanders beat the New York Giants in Week 2 despite not scoring a touchdown thanks to seven field goals on seven tries from new kicker Austin Seibert. They beat Cincinnati on the road on Monday night, then won at Arizona and took care of business at home against Cleveland.",
      "A predictable defeat at AFC heavyweight Baltimore followed to bring them back to earth. Teammates recalled Daniels' anger after losing, and it filtered around the room.",
      "\u201cNobody gets down, but everybody gets (ticked) off,\u201d Way said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get sad. You just get mad and then you go back and do better.\u201d",
      "The rib injury sidelined Daniels early in a rout of Carolina, but he returned the following week to beat the Bears. Winning 27-22 at the Giants the following week to improve to 7-2 was the kind of \u201cugly game\u201d that showed players what they could do when Daniels didn't have the magic touch.",
      "\u201cIt was like, man, we\u2019re just finding a way to win,\u201d Way said. \u201cThere\u2019s just this belief.\"",
      "Daniels completed 60.98% of his passes in his first five games back. The Commanders lost three in a row in November to Pittsburgh, at Philadelphia and to Dallas.",
      "They have not lost since, are 11-5 and have the chance to think about making a playoff run just as surprising as this season.",
      "\u201cI love being part of this group of guys, and it feels awesome to obviously be able to go to the playoffs in our first year,\u201d Ertz said. \"But we also feel like we still have some room to grow, room to improve. ... We just can\u2019t rest on our laurels.\u201d",

      "Former U.S. Open women's doubles champion Gabriela Dabrowski revealed on Tuesday she had played through 2024 after undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She delayed part of that treatment so she could compete at Wimbledon where she reached the doubles final.",
      "\u201cI know this will come as a shock to many, but I am OK and I will be OK,\u201d the 32-year-old Canadian said on social media. \u201cEarly detection saves lives. I can wholeheartedly agree with this.\u201d",
      "Dabrowski, ranked third in women's doubles, said in an Instagram post that she received the diagnosis in April. She did not play that month and in May because of surgery, but returned to the courts in June.",
      "Dabrowski said there was \u201ca slight delay in further treatment\u201d so she could compete at Wimbledon \u2014 where she and New Zealand's Erin Routliffe lost the final in July to Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend \u2014 and the Paris Olympics, where she won the bronze medal in mixed doubles with Felix Auger-Aliassime.",
      "Dabrowski said she had found a first lump in the second half of 2023 and was initially told not to worry about it.",
      "\u201cIt all seems surreal,\u201d Dabrowski wrote, saying she now has a \u201cbetter grasp\u201d of her treatment and side effects. \u201cFor a long time I wasn\u2019t ready to expose myself to the possible attention and questions I\u2019d have gotten before. I wanted to figure everything out and handle things privately with only those closest to me in the loop.\u201d",
      "Dabrowski and Routliffe won the WTA Finals at the end of this season. The pair also won the U.S. women's doubles title in 2023.",
      "\u201cMy mindset shifted from \u2018I have to do this (play tennis and not waste my skills)\u2019 to \u2018I get to do this.\u2019 Through this lens I find it so much easier to find joy in areas of my life I previously viewed as a heavy weight,\u201d she said.",

      "BOSTON -- The Dartmouth men\u2019s basketball team dropped its attempt to form a union on Tuesday, voluntarily ending a push to become the first college sports team to unionize in order to avoid a potentially damaging precedent from a National Labor Relations Board that soon will be controlled by Republicans.",
      "Lawyers for Service Employees International Union Local 560 withdrew their NLRB petition on Tuesday rather than take their chances in front of an unfriendly labor board.",
      "\u201cWhile our strategy is shifting, we will continue to advocate for just compensation, adequate health coverage, and safe working conditions for varsity athletes at Dartmouth,\" SEIU Local 560 President Chris Peck said in a statement that called collective bargaining \u201cthe only viable pathway to address issues\u201d facing college athletics today.",
      "The Dartmouth players petitioned the NLRB in 2023 to be allowed to unionize, saying the New Hampshire school exercised so much control over their schedules and working conditions that they met the legal definition of employees. A regional official agreed, and the team voted 13-2 in March to join SEIU Local 560, which already represents some Dartmouth workers.",
      "The school could not immediately be reached for comment. Dartmouth had previously said it would refuse to bargain with the players in an attempt to force the case into federal court.",

      "Curious calls by Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton and Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris backfired in Week 18 and put their rookie quarterbacks and teams in precarious positions regarding the playoffs",
      "DENVER -- Count coach Sean Payton among those second-guessing his decision to go for the tie and not the win at the end of regulation in Cincinnati last weekend.",
      "\u201cOh, certainly. You go through it all the time relative to what the call would have been,\u201d Payton said Monday. \u201cBased on the outcome, you always second-guess. You always do that as a head coach. I know I kind of felt I trusted my gut at the moment, but yes, I think it\u2019s normal to do that.\u201d",
      "That was an entirely different tone than Payton had in the emotional aftermath of Denver\u2019s 30-24 overtime loss to the Bengals on Saturday when he insisted, \u201cThe decision we made was the right one.\u201d",
      "Giving the ball back to Joe Burrow, the NFL\u2019s hottest quarterback, wasn\u2019t the best of moves for the Broncos, who didn\u2019t force a single punt in regulation, something Payton acknowledged he didn't realize until it was mentioned in his postgame news conference.",
      "After throwing a 25-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Mims Jr. on fourth down with 8 seconds remaining in regulation, Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix held up two fingers and pleaded with his coach to go for the win. Payton scanned his play sheet.",
      "\u201cYes, I definitely want the ball and a chance to win the game,\" said Nix, who nonetheless deferred to Payton, saying those calls are the coach's.",
      "After Mims' highlight-reel catch between Geno Stone and Mike Hilton was confirmed after a lengthy review, Payton instead sent out kicker Wil Lutz for the extra point to send the game into overtime.",
      "Cincinnati's clock mismanagement had given the Broncos time to score at the end of regulation. Instead of having Burrow take a knee and forcing Denver to burn its final timeout, Bengals coach Zac Taylor called for a handoff to Chase Brown, who hurt his right ankle on an awkward slide near the end zone. Payton called his final timeout, but the injury timeout was charged to the Bengals instead.",
      "Playing for overtime backfired on the Broncos when the Bengals outgained them 119 yards to 6 yards in overtime and Burrow threw his third touchdown pass to Tee Higgins to keep Cincy's slim playoff hopes alive and deny Denver a playoff-clinching win for the second straight weekend.",
      "It also injected some intrigue into the final weekend of games before the playoffs begin. The Broncos (9-7), Bengals (8-8) and Dolphins (8-8) all are alive for the seventh and final playoff spot in the AFC race with a trip to second-seeded Buffalo on tap for the team that clinches.",
      "The Broncos host the Kansas City Chiefs (15-1), who have clinched the AFC's top seed and are expected to rest most of their starters Sunday in Denver, where a loss would eliminate the Bengals, winners of four straight, and keep the Chiefs from having to face Burrow, who is in the midst of the best season of his career.",
      "Payton wasn't the only head coach who denied his rookie QB a confidence-inspiring, all-or-nothing moment only to lose 30-24 in overtime in Week 18.",
      "It was the same fate for the Atlanta Falcons after coach Raheem Morris' questionable clock management ahead of a 56-yard field goal try by Riley Patterson that came up short at the end of regulation and sent their game against the Washington Commanders into overtime Sunday.",
      "Washington won the coin toss and Jayden Daniels drove the Commanders on a 12-play, 70-yard march that ended with his 2-yard TD toss to tight end Zach Ertz to clinch a playoff spot. That sent the Falcons (8-8) careening into Week 18 needing both a win over the Panthers and a Saints upset of the Buccaneers (9-7) to make the playoffs.",
      "Morris acknowledged after the loss he \u201cprobably could have\u201d called a timeout after Michael Penix Jr. connected with Darnell Mooney on a 25-yard completion with 40 seconds left. Instead, the clock wound down to 17 seconds because he was \u201ctrying to save that timeout.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, it could have been a better decision to take that timeout, but I wanted to have the opportunity to move up there, so you can always second-guess those things,\" Morris said. \u201cCan always second-guess those motives. Can always go back and look at it to see if you could have snapped it a little quicker. But I really believe we can get our operation time a little faster and to save that timeout.\u201d",
      "Morris saved five of his six timeouts Sunday.",
      "Like Nix, Penix, the rookie quarterback making his second NFL start, deferred to his head coach on when to use timeouts.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s on Coach Raheem,\u201d Penix said. \u201cHe calls the timeouts whenever he feels fit. He trusted in us to get the plays off and make the next play. We all trust Coach\u2019s judgment on that, so that\u2019s what we are going to lean on.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Doug Christie took over as the interim head coach of the Sacramento Kings amid a season-long losing streak, fans booing the team off their home court and questions surrounding the decision to fire Mike Brown, who led the franchise to its first playoff ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Doug Christie took over as the interim head coach of the Sacramento Kings amid a season-long losing streak, fans booing the team off their home court and questions surrounding the decision to fire Mike Brown, who led the franchise to its first playoff appearance in 16 years in 2023",
      "Christie got his first win at the helm on Monday with a 110-100 win over the Mavericks, a victory that meant just as much to the team\u2019s season as it did to him personally. It wasn\u2019t particularly easy, with the Kings falling behind by 18 points early to a Dallas team missing Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.",
      "In the huddle, Christie told his players: \u201cYou\u2019re getting close.\u201d He cited a Bob Marley lyric about taking a bucket to the well and not knowing when the bottom will fall out. After the Kings picked up a couple of technical fouls in the second half, Christie stressed to his players that they shouldn\u2019t allow the referees to derail the gameplan.",
      "They responded, closing the third quarter on a 17-2 run and snapping a six-game losing streak to give the 15-year NBA veteran his first win since taking over the Kings.",
      "\u201cAre we going to still struggle from time to time?\u201d Christie said. \u201cYes, but the good will needed to happen to show that lot of things that we talk about \u2014 we\u2019re able to do. Now, we need to do it with the consistency, the intensity and the violent aggression, in my opinion, that needs to be there to win games at this level.\u201d",
      "Domantas Sabonis, who had 17 points and 16 rebounds, said that seeing Christie get his first win was \u201creally cool.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve spent three summers now with him,\u201d Sabonis said. \u201cHe works his butt off and just to see him installing what he believes in the guys, and the guys reacting that quickly to it is awesome.\u201d",
      "Being an NBA head coach, even with the interim tag, hasn\u2019t yet sunk in for Christie. He had been busy with assistant coaching and scouting duties ahead of getting the promotion, planning to catch up on some sleep when the team was in Los Angeles over the weekend. Instead, he found himself at the helm against the Lakers, subsisting on 90-minute naps.",
      "Christie\u2019s initial goals are incremental: Simplifying the offense in game one, followed by the defense in game two. The Kings held the Mavericks to just 40 points in the second half.",
      "He wants the fans, who have endured 12 coaching changes since 2007 with just one playoff appearance, to know that they are appreciated, that they\u2019ll put a product on the floor that makes them proud and that they can root for players who gave it their all. From his players, he hopes for both understanding and love.",
      "\u201cThis is hard,\u201d Christie said before the game. \u201cThis is high leverage, the best in the world. There are only a certain amount of people who do it, from my perspective and the players' perspective. Whatever you say about the word \u2018pressure,\u2019 it\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "Christie said that his job involves letting his players play after putting them in a position to succeed. Part of whether he succeeds as coach will hinge on his best player, De\u2019Aaron Fox, who pushed back earlier on Monday on reports that he was involved in Brown\u2019s firing.",
      "Christie, who has been an assistant with the Kings since 2021, won two games as an interim head coach in 2022 when Brown was sick. But Monday\u2019s win was his first on a semi-permanent basis, with the expectation that he\u2019ll get the rest of the season to prove himself as a head coach.",
      "One of the aspects that Christie hopes to improve is the team\u2019s record in close contests. The Kings are 6-13 in games that are within five points in the final five minutes. He said that being \u201cclutch\u201d comes down to which team is willing to dive on the floor and \u201csacrifice themselves in a way that's going to hurt.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to that point, what are you willing to do?\u201d Christie said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m willing to do for you, and I\u2019m going to support them in any way I can. Because it\u2019ll always be my fault. It\u2019ll never be their fault. They go do their job. I\u2019m here to take the bullets.\u201d",
      "Christie said building off the win will involve understanding that turning the season around is a process and wins are a byproduct.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard in this league,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWinning is difficult. So, totally understand that. I think they\u2019re beginning to feel it, and that\u2019s going to be the process that we have to go through on a night-to-night basis. I\u2019m here for it, and I think that they\u2019re ready to do it.\u201d",

      "Brock Purdy hurt his surgically repaired throwing elbow late in a loss to the Detroit Lions, the latest blow in an injury-plagued season for the San Francisco 49ers",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Brock Purdy hurt his surgically repaired throwing elbow late in a loss to the Detroit Lions on Monday night, the latest blow in an injury-plagued season for the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "The injury came in the final two minutes of a 40-34 loss for San Francisco when Brian Branch brought down Purdy with a sack on a blitz. Purdy rolled over as he fell to the ground and his right elbow went right into the face mask of defensive lineman Pat O'Connor.",
      "Purdy said his elbow was initially \u201con fire\u201d and he will need to undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel the best,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t feel that bad, so we\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Purdy said initial tests showed no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament he hurt in a 2022 NFC title-game loss at Philadelphia, and he hopes to play the season finale on Sunday.",
      "Purdy had surgery that offseason but made it back to start the 2023 season after going through an extensive rehabilitation.",
      "\u201cI talked to the doctors \u2014 he just got hit in the right spot,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cHit the nerves. He couldn\u2019t feel much.\u201d",
      "Joshua Dobbs replaced Purdy and led a touchdown drive to close out the loss, which left the Niners (6-10) assured of finishing in last place in the NFC West after making it to the Super Bowl last season.",
      "Purdy's injury was just the latest to hit San Francisco this season, with stars Christian McCaffrey, Trent Williams, Brandon Aiyuk, Nick Bosa and Dre Greenlaw among the many key players to be sidelined for multiple games.",
      "The situation was so dire that Purdy played Monday night behind an offensive line that featured third and fourth stringers at both left guard and left tackle.",
      "Purdy overcame that obstacle early, playing a nearly flawless first half when he threw two TD passes and ran for another score on the first three drives and posted a perfect 158.3 passer rating.",
      "\u201cWe were in a groove,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point of the game, we were just being aggressive and trying to win the game however it took. The pass game was going really well.\u201d",
      "After throwing another touchdown pass on San Francisco's first drive of the second half, Purdy struggled down the stretch, throwing two interceptions to Kerby Joseph that ended the Niners' hopes of a victory.",
      "That's the kind of season it has been for Purdy, who has been unable to match the heights he reached last season when he led the NFL with a 113 passer rating and 9.6 yards per attempt while finishing fourth in MVP voting.",
      "Purdy's numbers have taken a significant drop this season and he has 20 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions. But even with the injury and San Francisco out of playoff contention, Purdy wants to play Sunday at Arizona.",
      "\u201cI want to finish the season with our guys,\" he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s why wouldn\u2019t I play for my team and try to get some momentum going for the next year with our guys and make a statement to everybody here and that\u2019s going to be here next year that I\u2019m a competitor? I\u2019m going to be out on the field any chance I get.\u201d",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "An online spat between factions of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in the president-elect\u2019s political movement into public display",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House.",
      "The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement \u2014 wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry \u2014 and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",
      "But deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks.",
      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",
      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",
      "Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",
      "The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking."

    "story": [
      "Scientists say human-caused climate change added an average of 41 days of dangerous heat worldwide in 2024",
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.",
      "\u201cThe finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\u201d Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings. \u201cAs long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.\u201d",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to die in heat waves. But if we can\u2019t communicate convincingly, \u2018but actually a lot of people are dying,\u2019 it\u2019s much harder to raise this awareness,\u201d Otto said. \u201cHeat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\u201d",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren't inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research.",
      "\u201cCountries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.",

      "Jabbar drove from Houston to New Orleans on Tuesday evening and posted several videos online \"proclaiming his support for ISIS,\" and mentioning he joined ISIS before this summer, Raia said.",
      "\"There were five videos posted on Jabbar\u2019s Facebook account, which are time stamped beginning at 1:29 a.m. and the last at 3:02 a.m.,\" Raia said. \"In the first video, Jabbar explains he originally planned to harm his family and friends, but was concerned the news headlines would not focus on the 'war between the believers and the disbelievers.'\"",
      "An ISIS flag was recovered from the back of the truck, Raia said.",
      "The death toll is not expected to rise beyond 14 people, Dr. Jeffrey Elder of the University Medical Center New Orleans told ABC News Live on Thursday. Sixteen people remain hospitalized at University Medical Center New Orleans, including eight in intensive care.",
      "Jabbar was \"hell-bent\" on killing as many people as possible, driving a pickup truck onto the sidewalk around a parked police car serving as a barricade to plow into pedestrians, officials said.",
      "The suspect mowed down dozens of people over a three-block stretch on the world-famous thoroughfare while firing into the crowd, police said.",
      "Jabbar then exited the damaged vehicle armed with an assault rifle and opened fire on police officers, law enforcement said. He was also armed with a handgun, sources told ABC News.",
      "Officers returned fire, killing Jabbar, a U.S.-born citizen from Texas, sources said. At least two officers were injured, one by gunfire and the other when the officer was pinned by the truck, authorities said.",
      "New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said security bollards were not working at the time because they were in the process of being replaced for next month's Super Bowl.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Jabbar placing two improvised explosive devices in coolers in the Bourbon Street area, Raia said.",
      "\"Those are the only two devices that we've been able to recover that were functional -- both devices were rendered safe on scene,\" he said.",
      "Authorities have conducted search warrants in New Orleans and outside of Louisiana, the FBI's New Orleans field office said.",
      "A home in Houston was among those searched. The FBI in Houston said \"there is no threat to residents in that area.\"",
      "Raia urged anyone who knew Jabbar to come forward.",
      "\"While we have interviewed many people who know Jabbar, we still need to talk to others,\" he said. \"Whether you know Jabbar personally, worked with him, served in the military or saw him in New Orleans or Texas, we need to talk to you.\"",
      "He said police also want to speak with witnesses who were in the French Quarter on New Year's Eve or early on New Year's Day.",
      "The FBI has cleared Bourbon Street and authorities have the \"confidence\" to reopen it to the public ahead of the Sugar Bowl Thursday afternoon, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced Thursday.",
      "The game was initially set for Wednesday and was postponed in the wake of the attack.",
      "\"I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for game day today, but we're ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city,\" she said.",

      "There's no apparent direct connection between the New Orleans attack and Wednesday's Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, which is being investigated as a possible act of terror, Raia from the FBI said Thursday.",
      "The driver was killed and seven bystanders suffered minor injuries, authorities said. The motive behind the incident remains under investigation, but investigators told ABC News they believe it was \"intentional.\"",
      "The Cybertruck was rented via the Turo app, as was the truck used in the New Orleans attack, sources told ABC News.",

    "story": [
      "The explosion occurred outside the Trump Las Vegas hotel on Wednesday.",
      "The suspected driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded Wednesday outside the Trump International Las Vegas Hotel sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head prior to the blast, officials confirmed in a press briefing Thursday.",
      "Active duty Army soldier Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was also identified as the individual believed to have died in the the explosion. No one else suffered serious injuries.",
      "Officials are still waiting for DNA testing to come back to definitively confirm the person who died in the vehicle was Livelsberger, but overwhelming evidence -- including credit cards in his name, similar tattoos, Livelsberger purchasing the weapons in the truck and an ID card -- points to him as the individual. The fire and explosion made the identification process difficult because of the physical injuries sustained by the driver, officials said.",
      "Livelsberger shot himself in the head prior to the explosion and a gun was found at his feet, according to Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "Two guns -- one handgun and one rifle, which were found in the vehicle \"burnt beyond recognition\" -- had been purchased legally on Monday.",
      "Livelsberger served as a Green Beret in the Army and was on approved leave from serving in Germany at the time of his death, a U.S. Army spokesperson said Thursday.",
      "The incident is not believed to have any direct connection to the New Year's Day truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people -- as well as the suspect -- and injured 35 others, according to the FBI.",
      "\"At this point, there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas,\" the FBI's Christopher Raia said Thursday morning at a press conference on the New Orleans attack.",
      "The two drivers may have overlapped at Fort Liberty or in Afghanistan, though no evidence suggests the two ever were assigned together or knew each other, McMahill said.",
      "Livelsberger was a supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, an official briefed on the probe told ABC News. His wife, who investigators spoke to in Colorado Springs, said he had been out of the house since around Christmas after a dispute over allegations of infidelity, the official said.",
      "His wife told officials she did not believe Livelsberger would want to hurt anyone, the official told ABC News.",
      "Livelsberger is believed to have told the person he rented the truck from that he was going camping at the Grand Canyon, the official told ABC News.",
      "Investigators are still looking to determine how the items in the truck were detonated, but with the contents of the vehicle so badly burned, it may be a slow process, according to the official.",
      "The vehicle was picked up by license plate readers traveling from Colorado to Las Vegas on Wednesday morning.",
      "The driver of the Cybertruck pulled into the valet area of the hotel and the vehicle exploded, according to an official. The driver was the only fatality from the incident. Seven bystanders had minor injuries, authorities said.",
      "McMahill told reporters the truck was in front of the hotel for 17 seconds before it exploded.",
      "The sheriff said Tesla CEO Elon Musk helped the investigation by having the truck unlocked after it auto-locked in the blast and by giving investigators video of the suspect at charging stations along its route from Colorado to Las Vegas.",
      "McMahill said investigators were looking into any possible connections to the deadly attack in New Orleans earlier Wednesday but had not yet discovered a connection. Like the truck used in the New Orleans attack, the Cybertruck was also rented with the Turo app, officials said.",
      "Video played at the Las Vegas news conference showed a load of fireworks-style mortars, gasoline cans and camping fuel canisters in the back of the truck.",
      "McMahill said police believe the explosion was an \"isolated incident\" and that \"there is no further threat to the community.\" He also said police do not believe anyone was helping the Las Vegas suspect.",
      "\"We believe everything is safe now,\" McMahill said.",
      "The property is the subject of frequent threats and heightened security given its connection to Trump.",

      "Police have said that the suspect in Wednesday's shooting received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behavior.",

      "Speaker Mike Johnson and other top Republicans previewed the change at a press conference in November following GOP leadership elections.",
      "Within the proposed rules package, the motion to vacate rule will now require a total of nine sponsors in order to be considered privileged on the House floor.",
      "\u201cA resolution causing a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker shall not be privileged except if it is offered by a member of the majority party and has accumulated eight co-sponsors from the majority party at the time it is offered,\u201d the rules package states.",
      "During the last Congress, a single lawmaker was able to force a vote to \u201cvacate the chair\u201d -- which former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz used to remove then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy and plunged the House into chaos for several weeks before Johnson was elected speaker. Historically, this had been the position of the House, but hard-right Republicans used the tool as a threat to remove then-Speaker John Boehner in 2015. Democrats ultimately changed the rules to require the majority of the House to support the motion when they controlled the House but McCarthy was forced to switch the rule back by hardliners when the GOP got the majority back.",
      "After a speaker is elected, the House will hold a vote on the rules package -- requiring a simple majority for passage. Democrats are not expected to help Republicans clear this package, so Johnson won\u2019t be able to afford many GOP defections. This is typically the House\u2019s second vote they\u2019ll take after the election of the speaker and swearing-in of members.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 01:47:32 -0500",
    "summary": "It was a decision that robbed hundreds of athletes of their once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic glory",

      "It was a decision that robbed hundreds of athletes of their once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic glory",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- It was a decision that robbed hundreds of athletes of their once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic glory, and for more than four decades, it weighed heavily on the man who made it \u2014 Jimmy Carter.",
      "Carter\u2019s passing Sunday has unearthed memories from his 1977-1981 presidency. Somewhere between his greatest foreign-policy success (the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt) and his greatest failure (the Iran hostage crisis) sits the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.",
      "It was Carter who called for that boycott \u2014 a Cold War power play intended to express America\u2019s disdain for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter said the invasion \u201ccould pose the most serious threat to world peace since the second World War.\u201d",
      "The boycott garnered more than two-thirds support from the 2,400 members of the unwieldy U.S. Olympic Committee house of delegates, the governing body that made the official move to keep the athletes out of Moscow. In short time, that move came to be seen as the textbook example of the risks, confusion and low success rate of injecting politics into sports.",
      "\u201cWe were not allowed to go for a not-so-clear reason,\u201d said Edwin Moses, the hurdling great who won 122 straight races between 1977 and 1987, which included the Olympic gold-medal contests in 1976 and 1984.",
      "For decades, members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team \u2014 recognized as Olympians at home but not by the International Olympic Committee abroad \u2014 told stories about opportunities missed and dreams unfulfilled because of the trip to Moscow they never took. Of the 474 athletes who had qualified for the team in 1980, 227 would not get another chance to compete in the Olympic Games.",
      "Many athletes told stories of meeting Carter at a White House visit in the summer of 1980 that served as a tepid substitute. In Washington, the athletes received the highest honor civilians can receive from Congress: the Congressional gold medal. But those medals were only gold-plated bronze, not pure gold, and they weren\u2019t recorded in the Congressional record until a push was made nearly three decades later.",
      "Swimmer Jesse Vassallo, a reigning world champion in multiple events at the time, told Swimming World Magazine about meeting Carter in the reception line.",
      "Carter \u201creached out to shake my hand and he said \u2018How would you have done in Moscow?\u2019\u201d Vassallo recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I would have won two golds and a silver.\u2019 And he just gave me this (pained) look. He didn\u2019t ask anybody else that question.\u201d Wrestler Jeff Blatnick, a champion on the 1984 Olympic team, met Carter on an airplane years later. According to an essay written by the late USOC spokesman Mike Moran, Blatnick said: \u201cHe looks at me and says, \u2018Were you on the 1980 hockey team?\u2019 I say, \u2018No sir, I\u2019m a wrestler, on the summer team.\u2019 He says, \u2018Oh, that was a bad decision, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d",
      "In his 2021 biography on the 39th President, Kai Bird writes that the boycott was a byproduct of a hard line Carter decided to take against the Soviets at the urging of his national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had been in a long-running struggle with the less-hawkish Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, to influence Carter\u2019s thinking. \"History would prove Vance correct; Brzezinski\u2019s \u2018Carter Doctrine\u2019 never amounted to much more than a cover for wasteful arms exports,\u201d Bird wrote.",
      "And Carter\u2019s boycott did nothing to deter the Soviets. They stayed in Afghanistan for another nine years, while further disrupting the Olympic movement and America\u2019s own turn as an Olympic host four years later. The Soviets and 13 other countries, mostly from the Eastern Bloc, boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 in retaliation for what the Americans had done to Moscow four years earlier.",
      "Forty-four years after Carter\u2019s fateful decision, the Olympics remain every bit as politicized and polarized as they were back then. And for the past several years, the world has grappled with Russia\u2019s place in international sports in the wake of another invasion \u2014 this time, into neighboring Ukraine.",
      "How that war is resolved will help define Russia's role when the Olympics come back to Los Angeles in 2028.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:20:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The impact of his single-term foreign policy is still felt around the globe.",
    "story": [
      "The impact of his single-term foreign policy is still felt around the globe.",
      "A generous description of former President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy track record during his four tumultuous years in the White House would be one defined by peaks and valleys.",
      "There were highlights. Many see Carter's role in brokering the Camp David Accords, a revolutionary set of treaties between Israel and Egypt that would forever change the diplomatic landscape of the Middle East, as the foreign policy apex of his presidency.",
      "But there were also stinging failures, including the Iran hostage crisis -- a 444-day chapter of Carter's term during which 53 American diplomats and private citizens were held captive inside the U.S. embassy in Tehran.",
      "However, historians and analysts say understanding Carter's true impact requires looking far beyond the relatively short time he spent as leader of the free world, and that the former president -- once rejected as a failure -- has wielded an outsize influence on international affairs that will reverberate for years to come.",
      "When Carter left the White House in 1981, it was under a cloud of failure. In the wake of his punishing defeat by Ronald Reagan, Carter told one of his biographers that he was hopelessly distraught and wanted nothing more than to lie low in his native Georgia.",
      "That all changed, he said, when a cataclysmic event sent shockwaves through the Middle East: the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.",
      "Carter had worked alongside Sadat to broker the Camp David Accords, and in the process, the world leaders forged a deep, personal bond.",
      "While Carter was celebrated for his part in the negotiations, Sadat was lambasted by his own countrymen. Carter said he viewed the Egyptian leader's death at the hands of jihadists as Sadat paying the ultimate price for peace they had brokered in the wooded mountains of Maryland.",
      "Carter later credited that sacrifice for pulling him from his despair and eventually leading him to found The Carter Presidential Center -- a multifaceted nonprofit aimed at promoting human rights, with missions as varied as election monitoring and eradicating parasitic diseases.",
      "However, Carter's focus on easing suffering around the world was not a post-presidential pursuit so much as a return to form.",
      "On the campaign trail in the mid-1970s, Carter had vowed to make advancing human rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy -- a significant shift for the time.",
      "\"Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clear-cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights,\" he declared in his inaugural address.",
      "That sentiment is what drove Carter in 1979 to conclude negotiations with Panama aimed at giving the Central American nation control of the Panama Canal, administered by the U.S since construction began in 1904 (and now something President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to reassert).",
      "The State Department credits that development for enabling \"the United States to defend itself from charges of imperialism made by Soviet-aligned states\" and boosting cooperating between the U.S. and Panama.",
      "Yet, despite Carter's intentions, he sometimes wavered, and the actions he took in pursuit of his self-described \"fairness not force\" doctrine were prone to backfire, according to Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"Carter was a foreign policy neophyte, idealistic about efforts to achieve Middle East peace and driven by a Christian faith that informed his vocal but inconsistent focus on human rights,\" he said.",
      "Takeyh points to Carter's decision to turn a blind eye towards human rights abuses committed by the Iranian shah's government -- an influential partner in the fight against Soviet influence -- as an example of that inconsistency.",
      "Carter's critics say that blind spot also obscured the looming Iranian revolution and clouded his judgment of the newly installed regime, setting in motion a series of decisions that would foment the hostage crises and irreparably sour relations between Washington and Tehran.",
      "After Carter was once again caught off-guard by the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, he \"responded with increasingly hawkish actions,\" including \"an aggressive national security strategy focused on the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East\" -- foreshadowing the decades of war in the region to come, according to Takeyh.",
      "However, other analysts argue that Carter's open embrace of human rights was actually a subtle success -- but one that took years to come fully into focus.",
      "Reagan, Carter's successor, is often credited with bringing about the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with it, the end of the Cold War. But Daniel Fried, a former U.S ambassador to Poland and distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, argues that Carter's contributions are overlooked.",
      "\"Introducing human rights into U.S. bilateral relations meant that the default Cold War policy that a reliably anticommunist government could be embraced,\" Fried said, adding that it meant tolerating authoritarian rule was \"no longer automatic.\"",
      "\"By elevating human rights in the mix of U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Soviet bloc relations, Carter put the United States on offense in the Cold War and on the side of the people of the region,\" he added.",
      "Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americans program at Chatham House, describes Carter's elevation of human rights as \"visionary.\"",
      "\"It came at a time when the promotion of human rights was seen to be at odds with the more central priorities of a superpower during the Cold War,\" she said.",
      "Vinjamuri says that approach continued to serve Carter in the four decades following his time in the White House as he pushed to advance peace and democracy around the world, orchestrating missions to Bosnia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Haiti.",
      "Still Carter's willingness to put people and personal relationships at the heart of foreign diplomacy can be seen as either a bug or a feature of his approach.",
      "Both during and after his presidency, Carter's willingness to meet face-to-face with communist leaders and deepen ties with the nations they led repeatedly sparked controversy.",
      "In 1979, Carter severed formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan -- choosing to recognize Beijing as the sole legal government of China, effectively creating Washington's \"One China policy.\"",
      "Congress swiftly retaliated by passing the Taiwan Relations Act, requiring the U.S. to provide defensive arms to Taiwan -- legislation that Carter signed. The two steps, seemingly at odds, set the tone for the complicated and deeply consequential relationship between the powers that exists to this very day.",
      "More than two decades later, Carter became the first president in or out of office to visit Cuba since the country's revolution in 1959. While some heralded the 2002 trip as a groundbreaking step to promote democracy that cemented Carter's status as an accomplished statesman, others slammed the former president -- accusing him of legitimizing Cuba's President Fidel Castro and his regime.",
      "But Carter's willingness to cross boundaries in pursuit of what he saw as global good did not end with world leaders.",
      "The same year Carter traveled to Cuba, he also journeyed to Africa -- visiting several countries where the AIDS/HIV epidemic was still ravaging populations and deeply stigmatizing.",
      "There, alongside former South African President Nelson Mandela, Carter cradled babies infected with the virus, lovingly holding the infants as cameras snapped pictures.",
      "Dr. Helene Gayle, the president of Spelmen College, who accompanied Mandela and Carter on the trip, says it's a scene she will never forget.",
      "\"They wanted to show everyone that these babies were no harm to anyone, including world leaders,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:32:24 -0500",
    "summary": "During and after his presidency, Jimmy Carter spent years working to advance global public health, including helping to nearly eradicate one disease.",
    "story": [
      "Carter strove to help nearly eliminate Guinea worm disease, and more.",
      "As world leaders mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter and remark on his political and policy legacy, doctors are remembering his efforts to prevent disease, and his legacy in furthering global public health.",
      "The 39th president spent five decades working to eradicate a parasitic disease, helped organize a major-drug donation program, and made advancements addressing the mental health crisis in the U.S.",
      "Dr. Julie Jacobson, currently a managing partner of the nonprofit Bridges to Development, helped to provide funding for the Carter Center's work in the Americas, Nigeria and Ethiopia while she worked for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for over a decade.",
      "\"He was hugely influential, I think particularly for the diseases that most of the world doesn't appreciate even exist,\" Jacobson told ABC News of Jimmy Carter's work. \"He was a true champion for the neglected tropical diseases, which are some of the most common infections of people who live with the least resources. And he found these diseases and then really wanted to do something about them, and used his voice, his influence, his passion, to continue to push forward where others were really not interested.\"",
      "Near-eradication of Guinea worm disease",
      "Following his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, Carter founded the Carter Center in 1982, a non-profit organization that \"seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health,\" according to the Center's website.",
      "Among the organization's many efforts, the Carter Center helped spearhead a successful international campaign with the goal of eradicating dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease, a parasitic infection caused by consuming contaminated drinking water.",
      "Water from ponds or other stagnant bodies of water can contain tiny crustaceans commonly known as water fleas, which in turn can be infected with Guinea worm larvae, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "About one year after infecting a human host, the Guinea worm creates a blister on the skin and emerges from it, which can cause burning pain, fever and swelling, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization.",
      "\"Nobody else wanted to take it on,\" Jimmy Carter told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos during a 2015 interview on \"Good Morning America\". \"So, I decided to take it on.\"",
      "In 1986, Guinea worm disease afflicted 3.5 million people every year in 21 African and Asian countries. Disease incidence has since been reduced by 99.99%, to just 14 \"provisional\" human cases in 2023, according to the Carter Center.",
      "Jacobson said that success is even more remarkable because there are no vaccines available to prevent Guinea worm disease and no drugs to treat it. Tracking Guinea worm disease, according to Jacobson, involves following possible cases for a year to determine if they are infected, checking to see if infected humans have any infected water sources near them, and monitoring the community as a whole.",
      "\"To think that you could eradicate a disease without any tools is really still just a crazy idea, but he did it with perseverance and working with people in the grassroots within communities and putting together teams of people to go and work with people in those communities and empower the communities,\" Jacobson said.",
      "The Carter Center says if efforts are successful, Guinea worm disease could become the second human disease in history to be completely eradicated, after smallpox, and the first to be done without the use of a vaccine or medicine.",
      "Carter told ABC News during the 2015 interview that eradicating the disease entirely was his goal: \"I think this is going to be a great achievement for, not for me, but for the people that have been afflicted and for the entire world to see diseases like this eradicated.\"",
      "Mass drug distribution for river blindness",
      "The Carter Center also works to fight other preventable diseases, including the parasitic infections schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis \u2013 more commonly known as snail fever and elephantiasis, respectively \u2013 as well as trachoma, which is one of the world's leading causes of preventable blindness. It's also working with the governments of Haiti and the Dominican Republic to eliminate lymphatic filariasis and malaria from the island of Hispaniola, which both countries share and which is \"the last reservoir in the Caribbean for both diseases,\" according to the Carter Center.",
      "Carter and his organization also played a part in organizing a major drug-donation program to help eliminate onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is transmitted to human through repeated bites of infected blackflies, according to the CDC.",
      "Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. had been implementing field studies in Africa which showed that the drug ivermectin was effective at treating river blindness in humans. The Carter Center partnered with Merck to mass-distribute ivermectin, brand name Mectizan, \"as much as needed for as long as needed\" in Africa and Latin America. To date, the Carter Center has assisted in distributing more than 500 million treatments of Mectizan, according to Merck.",
      "In 1995, Carter negotiated a two-month cease-fire in Sudan to allow health care workers there to more safely help eradicate Guinea worm disease, prevent river blindness, and vaccinate children against polio.",
      "\"When we have known solutions, it is ethical to make sure they're available to the people who need it most,\" Dr. Usha Ramakrishnan, chair of the Department of Global Health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"And that's where we were with river blindness. There was a treatment, but improving access to medications, making it affordable, reaching the people they need was very much along the lines of the work [the Carter Center] was doing.\"",
      "Addressing mental health",
      "Carter was also committed to tackling mental health issues. During his presidency, he created the Presidential Commission on Mental Health, which recommended a national plan to care for people with chronic mental illness.",
      "Although it was never adopted as policy by the Reagan administration, the plan's recommended strategies were adopted by some mental health advocacy groups to \"make gains in the 1980s,\" according to one study.",
      "Carter also signed into law the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which provided funding to community mental health centers.",
      "After his presidency, Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter continued working to improve access to mental health.",
      "Ramakrishnan said the Carters' work helped to reduce some of the stigma associated with mental health.",
      "\"There continues to be a lot of stigma, but they truly got it out [in] the conversation and mainstreaming mental health as an important aspect of health and well-being,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"There's still a lot of challenges, and there are many capable people that they have mentored and trained who are carrying that mantle forward.\"",

      "Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, had been \"been champions and groundbreaking voices for affordable, decent housing for all\" since 1984, according to Habitat for Humanity. The Carters donated their time and influence and worked with nearly 103,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,331 homes, the nonprofit stated.",
      "Rhode Island-based builder and designer Kenneth Young, 66, first began volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in the 1990s. After his first \"Carter build\" in 1995 in Watts, California, a neighborhood in southern Los Angeles, he \"got the bug,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Since then, Young has carried out 20 builds, many alongside the 39th president of the United States -- including Carter's last build in Nashville in 2019, Young said.",
      "Young's favorite memory of Carter was during a build in Budapest, Hungary, in 1996, when the residents of a newly built home -- twin boy toddlers -- smacked him in the face with a balloon and Carter, a grandfather himself, \"took in it stride\" and with a smile.",
      "\"It was classic,\" Young said.",
      "Don Shaw and Thomas Trumble -- lifelong friends who have been volunteering together for decades with the Habitat for Humanity chapter in Hartford, Connecticut, first worked with Carter in 2002 during a build in Durban, South Africa, they told ABC News.",

      "Shaw and Trumble went on to join Carter on builds in Mexico, India, Thailand, Canada and twice in Haiti, they said. They were also with Carter during his last build in Nashville.",

      "On the job site, Carter was a natural leader, Young said.",
      "Carter's presence alone was enough inspire everyone to work hard and efficiently. The builds run by the Carters were \"a logistical miracle,\" Shaw said, adding that it was often astonishing to see how many homes the group could build within a mere week.",
      "\"President Carter, also being a Navy man, and having that military background., he wants it right. He wants it done properly. And he wants it on time,\" Young said.",
      "Shaw nicknamed Carter the \"benevolent taskmaster,\" he said.",

      "President Joe Biden said on Wednesday there is \"no justification\" for what he called the \"horrific\" attack early on New Year's Day in New Orleans, noting that the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.",
      "\"I have been continually briefed since early this morning by federal law enforcement leadership and my homeland security team, including Secretary of Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and the Mayor of New Orleans regarding the horrific incident that occurred there overnight,\" Biden said in a written statement.",
      "At least 15 people were killed and 25 injured when a vehicle rammed into a crowd gathered on Bourbon Street, authorities said.",
      "Police say the driver was \"hell-bent\" on causing damage as they drove on the street at a very fast pace in the early morning hours Wednesday. The driver then exited the vehicle with an assault weapon, and was shot and killed by officers.",
      "\"I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury,\" Biden said. \"I have directed my team to ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\"",
      "\"I will continue to receive updates throughout the day, and I will have more to say as we have further information to share. In the meantime, my heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday,\" the president added in the statement. \"There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities.\"",
      "Biden briefly spoke about the attack as he departed Delaware to travel to Camp David, though he declined to comment on specific questions from reporters regarding the suspect's identity.",
      "\"I've contacted every agency in the federal government, as well as the state. They're all coordinating to get -- get to the bare facts,\" he said.",
      "The suspect was later identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas, according to the FBI. Authorities are working to determine whether the deceased suspect had any affiliation with terrorist organizations after an ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, the FBI said.",
      "The president said his first reaction to learning about the violence was \"one of anger and frustration\" and that he would have more to say soon.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in on the tragedy, calling it \"pure evil.\"",

The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!\" Trump wrote in a statement on his conservative social media platform.",
      "\"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,\" Trump falsely implied, hours before the FBI identified the suspect as a U.S. citizen from Texas.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana native, also called the violence \"pure evil.\"",

We've got to track them down, we've got to hunt them down, we've got to find out their supporting network, and we've got to bring them to justice,\" Cassidy said on Fox News.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Nearly 200 absentee ballots somehow went uncounted in Wisconsin's liberal capital after the Nov. 5 election, prompting state election officials to launch an investigation Thursday into whether the city clerk broke the law.",
      "The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously to investigate whether Madison City Clerk Maribeth Wetzel-Biehl failed to comply with state law or abused her discretion. Commission members said they were concerned the clerk's office didn't inform them of the problem until late December, almost a month and a half after the election. Commission Chair Ann Jacobs certified Wisconsin's election results on Nov. 29.",
      "Wetzel-Biehl's office said in a statement that the number of uncounted votes didn't affect the outcome of any race or referendum on the ballots. But Jacobs said the oversight was \u201cso egregious\u201d that the commission must determine what happened and how it can be prevented as spring elections approach.",
      "\u201cWe are the final canvassers,\" Jacobs said. \u201cWe are the final arbiters of votes in the state of Wisconsin and we need to know why those ballots weren't included anywhere.\u201d",
      "Wetzel-Biehl said in an email to The Associated Press that her office looks forward to working with the commission to determine what happened and how to prevent the same issues in future elections.",
      "It\u2019s another misstep for Wetzel-Biehl, who announced in September that her office mistakenly sent out up to 2,000 duplicate absentee ballots. She blamed it on a data processing error.",
      "According to election commission documents, the commission learned of the uncounted ballots on Dec. 18, when Wetzel-Biehl's staff told the commission that they recorded more absentee ballots as received than ballots counted in three city wards.",
      "The commission asked Wetzel-Biehl to provide a detailed statement, which she did two days later. The memo stated that on Nov. 12, the clerk\u2019s office discovered 67 unprocessed ballots for Ward 65 and one unprocessed ballot for Ward 68 in a courier bag found in a vote tabulating machine.",
      "The memo also stated that her office was reconciling ballots for Ward 56 on Dec. 3 when 125 unprocessed ballots were discovered in a sealed courier bag. Reconciliation is a post-election process in which officials account for every ballot created. That work begins immediately after an election. Clerks have 45 days to complete it.",
      "The memo does not offer any explanation, saying only that the clerk's office planned \u201cto debrief these incidents and implement better processes.\u201d",
      "The clerk's office issued a statement on Dec. 26 saying it had informed the elections commission and would send an apology letter to each affected voter.",

    "story": [
      "While West Virginia's employee health insurance program covers drugs like Ozempic for people with type 2 diabetes, officials decided to indefinitely pause covering their use for weight loss patients because of the cost",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Lory Osborn says the Wegovy she was prescribed 15 months ago did more than help her lose 75 pounds \u2014 over a quarter of her body weight. The administrative assistant at West Virginia University said she feels healthier at 62 than she has since graduating high school.",
      "But lately, she's been having panic attacks because she fears running out of medication. Citing a gross cost of $1.4 million a month, West Virginia abruptly announced in March it would indefinitely pause a pilot program covering weight loss drugs for 1,000 public employees, leaving patients like her scrambling. West Virginia\u2019s Public Employee Insurance Agency (PEIA) will continue covering the popular and expensive GLP-1 drugs to treat Type 2 diabetes.",
      "Other state and private insurers have adopted similar stances for the drugs, which can cost patients more than $1,000 monthly out-of-pocket. In 2024, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state\u2019s largest nonprofit insurer, and North Carolina's state employee public insurance agency stopped covering the drugs for weight loss, saying the cost increased premiums for all customers.",
      "The dilemma comes amid a similar debate at the federal level. President Joe Biden unveiled a plan in November to cover the drugs for millions of weight loss patients on Medicaid and Medicare, though the measure could face opposition from President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, has criticized Ozempic \u2014 a GLP-1 used to treat diabetes.",
      "Proponents say long-term savings could outweigh the cost \u2014 especially in West Virginia, which has the nation's highest rates of obesity and diabetes. Obesity increases their risk for conditions such as heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. About half of West Virginians rely on Medicare or Medicaid for insurance.",
      "Osborn said it makes no sense for West Virginia to invest the money in the pilot only for patients to come off it and lose their progress. Osborn usually takes her injections once weekly, but said she started waiting 10 or 12 days to make her final three-month supply last.",
      "\u201cIt is so cruel,\u201d said Osborn, who took her last PEIA-covered dose of Wegovy weeks ago. \u201cWe are suffering mentally just from the thought of going back.\u201d",
      "West Virginia\u2019s residents are among the poorest in the U.S. and the state is home to rural food deserts where it can be hard to find any grocery stores, never mind finding one with a variety of nutritional food options.",
      "Outgoing West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice \u2014 who has lost between 30 and 50 pounds while taking Ozempic \u2014 said after Biden's announcement that he would \u201cbe a proponent of trying to do everything we can to be able to expand these drugs to everybody.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s a real argument that at the end of the day, we end up saving that money,\" said Justice, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in November. About 25% of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight loss drugs, according to the AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus, a database produced by the Leverage consulting firm.",
      "The vast majority of coverage of the drugs is provided by government health plans, largely state Medicaid plans, according to Leverage. All state Medicaid programs cover the drugs for Type 2 diabetes, but only 14 provide some form of coverage to treat obesity. Medicare plans cover the drugs for weight loss if they are prescribed to a person at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Dr. Laura Davisson, medical weight management director at West Virginia University, said losing coverage for medications is a \u201cnightmare\u201d for patients. This year, Davisson\u2019s office saw over 1,000 GLP-1 patients \u2014 many of whom have made extra appointments or joined support groups with her staff to discuss options when they learned of the coverage changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the state with the number one rate of obesity, and I\u2019ve just lost all access to my most powerful tool for treating obesity medically with almost every one of my payers,\u201d she said. \u201cHow does that make sense?\u201d",
      "The length of time she sees patients take the drugs varies, but some may have to take it indefinitely to suppress food cravings. She said the state employee pilot program took a responsible approach by requiring that patients be prescribed the medications through obesity specialists, giving them counseling on diet, exercise and side effect management.",
      "\u201cThey already invested millions of dollars in these people,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s financially wasteful to throw it away, have these people regain their weight, get their health problems back, and we don\u2019t actually get to see the full potential of this pilot project.\"",
      "Dr. Bisher Mustafa of the Marshall Health Obesity Clinic in Huntington said there's a certain irony to waiting \"until people have diabetes to start the medication.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try to prevent diabetes from happening from the beginning,\u201d he said.",
      "PEIA Director Brian Cunningham said GLP-1s, which the state began offering for weight loss in 2019, cost the program around $53 million last fiscal year \u2014 about 20% of what PEIA spends on drugs.",
      "The cost of the GLP-1s was cited as a reason for 14% premium hikes for state employees, as well as a 16% increase for county employees and a 12% bump in costs for retirees. Increases will go into effect in July, according to the insurance agency, which covers 150,000 government workers, 56,000 retirees and their dependents.",
      "That's frustrated some PEIA members who feel they are unfairly shouldering the cost burden for a medication they don't use. Ashley Peggs, a Kanawha County teacher who doesn't use GLP-1 drugs, said her heart sank when she saw how much the plan was spending on the medicines during a public hearing about the proposed premium increases.",
      "She said the agency had just denied coverage for a spinal procedure for a condition threatening her ability to walk.",
      "\"So somebody else being skinny is more important than the fact that I literally may not be able to continue teaching until I retire without a wheelchair?\" said Peggs, 35, at the public hearing.",
      "Some taking the drugs for diabetes \u2014 like the vast majority of state employees on GLP-1s \u2014 expressed frustration that they haven't even been able to access Ozempic consistently because of shortages.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be cheaper: pay for that medication or for me to lose a leg to gangrene like my grandmother did?\u201d said Michael Kimball, 42, who takes the drug for diabetes. \u201cYear after year, the burden is put on the back of the working man and we\u2019re getting a little tired of it.\"",
      "Osborn described Wegovy as a breakthrough recommended by her provider after she'd tried for years to lose weight any way she could. She's also been able to halve the amount of rheumatoid arthritis medication she takes and she's seen back pain and her sciatica almost eradicated.",
      "She said dropping coverage for obesity patients feels like \u201cweight-based discrimination\u201d because other chronic diseases qualify. Osborn said she'll try purchasing versions of the medications that aren't approved by the FDA through compounding pharmacies. Doing so will increase her cost to around $300 per month. PEIA had provided her with a three-month supply for $50.",
      "\u201cI think that they need to realize that obesity is a disease \u2014 it's not a willpower, gutting-it-out choice,\" she said. \"It is a disease that you suffer from just like any other disease that you cannot prevent.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Tennessee prison officials say they won't publicly release the the state's latest manual for executing death row inmates",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Just days after Tennessee announced it had a new manual for executing death row inmates, the state's top prison officials said they aren't going to release the document to the public.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction last week told The Associated Press to file a public records request to obtain a copy of the latest execution manual, known as a protocol. However, the agency this week denied the AP's request, saying it needs to keep the entire document secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved.",
      "The decision to maintain secrecy differs from how the state has handled similar requests in the past, but mirrors efforts across the U.S. to suppress public access surrounding executions, especially after anti-death penalty activists used records to expose problems.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The protocol is typically a detailed set of procedures describing how the state executes death row inmates. Tennessee had been operating under a 2018 protocol that included directions on selecting execution team staff and the training they should undergo. It explained how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. It gave instructions on the inmate's housing, diet and visitation in the days leading up to execution. It provided directions on how to choose media witnesses.",
      "For lethal injection, the 2018 protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence.",
      "The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. But that is all that is known about the revised protocol.",
      "In an email sent Monday, Tennessee correction spokesperson Kayla Hackney told the AP the \u201cprotocol is not a public record\" and cited a Tennessee statute that makes the identities of the people carrying out executions confidential.",
      "However, that same statute says the existence of confidential information in a record is not a reason to deny access to it, noting that the confidential information should be redacted.",
      "In 2018, Tennessee's correction agency provided a redacted copy of the protocol to an AP reporter over email.",
      "In 2007, a previous version of the protocol was treated as a public record and provided to the AP after former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, announced a surprise halt to executions. A reporter's review of that 100-page \u201cManual of Execution\u201d found a jumble of conflicting instructions that mixed new lethal-injection instructions with those for electrocution.",
      "Executions have been on hold in Tennessee since 2022, when the state admitted it had not been following the 2018 protocol. Among other things, the Correction Department was not consistently testing the execution drugs for potency and purity.",
      "An independent review of the state\u2019s lethal injection practice later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested. Later, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection drugs \u201cincorrectly testified\u201d under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required.",
      "Executions in the U.S. have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections.",
      "Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams and some courts have criticized such arguments for lack of evidence that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials.",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender\u2019s habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee\u2019s death row inmates, described the state's refusal to release the new protocol, given that background, as \u201cmystifying.\"",
      "\u201cThe secrecy, which cloaked the former execution protocol, created a culture of incompetence and lack of accountability,\u201d she said in an email."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Seven years ago, New Orleans officials began installing adjustable barriers at intersections in the famed French Quarter to temporarily prevent vehicles from entering the tourist area where the narrow streets are typically teeming with pedestrians every night.",
      "But the steel columns known as bollards were in the process of being replaced and were not engaged early on New Year's Day when a motorist rammed a pickup truck through a crowd of revelers, killing at least 15 people.",
      "The project to remove and replace the bollards along about eight blocks of bustling Bourbon Street, from St. Ann Street to Canal Street, began Nov. 18, city records show. Temporary asphalt patches were installed in the spots where the steel columns were removed, according to the documents.",
      "City officials have not confirmed whether the intersection the truck sped through was actively under construction or said if the replacement project created a vulnerability.",
      "Some of the old bollards had \u201cproved unreliable and have been non-operational,\u201d the city said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \u201cIn the interim, white gate barriers have been used in these areas, managed by the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) to secure the street and regulate vehicle access for safety purposes.\u201d",
      "One day before New Year\u2019s Eve, New Orleans officials issued a traffic advisory about its vehicle barrier replacement project, stating that crews would work until 2 p.m. on Monday and try to \u201cminimize road closures as much as possible to reduce impacts\" during the celebration.",
      "\u201cCurrently, Bourbon Street is fully open from Canal Street to Toulouse Street,\u201d the city said in its Dec. 30 advisory.",
      "The intersection of Bourbon and Canal is where the pickup swerved around a police blockade and rammed into the mass of people. The driver was shot to death by police and the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, authorities said.",
      "As vehicle attacks have increased in recent decades, cities around the world have installed bollards in pedestrian-heavy areas. New York City has put up similar retractable steel columns around Times Square, City Hall and Wall Street. They are also a common sight in other large cities such as London, Paris and Tokyo.",
      "There have been proposals over the years to turn much of Bourbon Street into a pedestrian plaza managed by a team focused on making it safe, Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser said Wednesday. He told The Associated Press that it\u2019s important to examine every aspect of safety following the New Year\u2019s Day carnage.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t prevent something like this when someone wants to kill people,\u201d Nungesser said, \u201cbut I\u2019m hoping we take a hard look at what we do because there will be another one, whether it\u2019s in New Orleans or elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Addressing the removal of the bollards, Nungesser said, \u201cHow does that happen for a major event?\u201d",
      "Initially installed beginning in Dec. 2017 as part of a $40 million safety plan, the New Orleans' bollards system consisted of four sets of barriers placed at either side of Bourbon Street intersections. The inner two columns can be pushed back when unlocked by a ground-level control panel, allowing for a roughly 13-foot (4-meter) berth for vehicles to navigate through, NOLA.com reported when construction began.",
      "Aaron Miller, director of the city\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said at the time that the bollards would go up nightly in keeping with city rules that close off stretches of the popular French Quarter boulevard exclusively to pedestrians. Otherwise, they would only be used to block intersections either by a city ordinance or during special events, he said.",
      "The barriers were \u201cdesigned to mitigate against what we believe the risk is for pedestrians\" in a part of the city he said was \u201can iconic or symbolic target,\u201d Miller said in Dec. 2017.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s rampage happened amid the ongoing Bourbon Street Bollard Assessment and Replacement Project, which includes \u201cremoving the old bollards, replacing concrete pavement, constructing concrete bases, installing metal sleeves for the new bollards, and repouring the roadway,\u201d according to the city's Wednesday statement. So far, 11 of the 16 bollard locations have been replaced, the statement said.",
      "Daily inspections monitor progress, and testing reports issued today confirm the required material strength has been achieved.",
      "On Dec. 10, the city posted a photo on social media of a torn-up street in the French Quarter, with two bollards sitting atop a pallet. Work was scheduled to be completed by early Feb. 2025, when New Orleans will host the Super Bowl, city records show.",
      "\u201cThe project includes replacing old bollards with new removable stainless-steel bollards and sidewalk repairs at various locations,\u201d a Department of Public Works document states.",
      "In a Nov. 26 update, city officials said work including concrete pouring was occurring on both sides of Bourbon Street \u201cwithout closing intersections to vehicle traffic.\u201d",

      "Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said authorities know who rented the truck with the Turo app in Colorado, but are not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "McMahill said video captured at Telsa charging stations provided by CEO Elon Musk helped authorities track the vehicle\u2019s journey, arriving in Las Vegas about 7:30 AM. then driving about an hour later into the valet area of the Trump International Hotel, where it sat 15 to 20 seconds before the explosion occurred.",
      "Video presented at an afternoon news conference showed a tumble of charred fireworks mortars, cannisters and other explosive devices crowded into the back of the pickup. The truck bed walls were still intact because the blast shot straight up rather than to the sides.",
      "Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that \u201cwe have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.\u201d",

      "Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support the former president. He was at Trump\u2019s resort on election night and has been a frequent guest there. Trump has named Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, to co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government\u2019s size and spending.",
      "\u201cThis is a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it\u2019s the Trump Tower,\u201d McMahill said when reporters asked about possible political connections. \u201cSo there\u2019s obviously things to be concerned about and it\u2019s something we continue to look at.\u201d",
      "The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter early on New Year\u2019s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone.",

      "NORFOLK, Va. -- Federal agents found one of the largest stockpiles of homemade explosives they have ever seized when they arrested a Virginia man on a firearms charge last month, according to a court filing by federal prosecutors.",
      "Investigators seized more than 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices when they searched the home of Brad Spafford northwest of Norfolk in December, the prosecutors said in a motion filed Monday. The prosecutors wrote that this is believed to be \u201cthe largest seizure by number of finished explosive devices in FBI history.\"",
      "Most of the bombs were found in a detached garage at the home in Isle of Wight County, along with tools and bomb-making materials including fuses and pieces of plastic pipe, according to court documents. The prosecutors also wrote: \u201cSeveral additional apparent pipe bombs were found in a backpack in the home\u2019s bedroom, completely unsecured,\" in the home he shares with his wife and two young children.",
      "Spafford, 36, was charged with possession of a firearm in violation of the National Firearms Act. Law enforcement officers allege he owned an unregistered short barrel rifle. Prosecutors said that he faces \u201cnumerous additional potential charges\u201d related to the explosives.",
      "Defense attorneys argued in a motion Tuesday that authorities haven't produced evidence that he was planning violence, also noting that he has no criminal record. Further, they question whether the explosive devices were usable because \u201cprofessionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them.\u201d",
      "\"There is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,\" the defense lawyers wrote.",
      "Messages were left Wednesday seeking further comment from the defense lawyers who signed the motion, Lawrence Woodward and Jerry Swartz.",
      "The investigation began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend, told authorities Spafford had disfigured his hand in 2021 while working on homemade explosives. Prosecutors said he only has two fingers on his right hand. The informant told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of the president, an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, for target practice and that \u201che believed political assassinations should be brought back,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on Dec. 17. The agents located the rifle and the explosive devices, some of which had been hand-labeled as \u201clethal\u201d and some of which were loaded into a wearable vest, court documents state. Technicians detonated most of the devices on site because they were deemed unsafe to transport, though several were kept for analysis.",
      "At a hearing Tuesday, federal Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard determined that Spafford could be released into house arrest at his mother's home but agreed to keep him detained while the government files further arguments.",
      "In response, prosecutors reiterated why they believe Spafford is dangerous, writing that \u201cwhile he is not known to have engaged in any apparent violence, he has certainly expressed interest in the same, through his manufacture of pope bombs marked \u2018lethal,\u2019 his possession of riot gear and a vest loaded with pipe bombs, his support for political assassinations and use of the pictures of the President for target practice.\u201d"

      "Funeral services honoring Carter, who died Sunday at 100, will be held in Georgia and Washington, beginning Jan. 4 and concluding Jan. 9.",
      "Trump was a frequent and fierce critic of Carter on the campaign trail ahead of November's election, using the rising inflation rates of the 1970s to unfavorably compare President Joe Biden to Carter and his administration.",
      "But the president-elect was gracious about the former president in posts on his social media site after Carter's death Sunday, writing that the nation \u201cowed him a debt of gratitude.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for,\u201d Trump wrote of Carter. \u201cHe worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.\u201d",
      "Wearing a tuxedo as he entered the festivities, Trump took a few minutes of questions from reporters on various topics. He was asked about the possibility of a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, but said only, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens.\"",
      "The president-elect added of hostages seized more than a year ago by Hamas, \u201cI\u2019ll put it this way: They better let the hostages come back soon.\"",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole light over the whole world, not just our country. They\u2019re a lot of happy people,\u201d Trump said of recent weeks.",

      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- A New Jersey offshore wind project is seeking a second delay, saying it still can't find someone to build crucial equipment for the turbines in the latest patch of turbulence striking the industry.",
      "Leading Light Wind had already received one pause on its project from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, which acknowledged the difficulty the project has had in finding a manufacturer for the blades that would spin to generate electricity.",
      "But that pause ended on Dec. 20. The day before, Leading Light asked the board for an additional stay, this time through May 20.",
      "It did not specify an inability to find a blade manufacturer as the reason for needing a second delay, but its most recent request said, \u201cThe offshore wind equipment market continues to experience significant price volatility and the company has not yet identified a solution to that volatility.\u201d",
      "The company did not respond to inquiries on Monday and Tuesday about whether a blade manufacturer is at the heart of the second request.",
      "\"This additional time will allow us to continue to navigate ongoing market shifts and supply chain challenges, as we work to advance development of this important project for New Jersey,\u201d Wes Jacobs, the project director, said in a statement.",
      "The board could not estimate when it might consider the request.",
      "The project, from Chicago-based Invenergy and New York-based energyRE, would be built 40 miles (65 kilometers) off Long Beach Island and would consist of up to 100 turbines, enough to power 1 million homes.",
      "Leading Light was one of two projects the state utilities board chose in January 2024. But just three weeks after that approval, one of three major turbine manufacturers, GE Vernova, said it would not build the kind of turbine Invenergy planned to use in the project, according to a public filing.",
      "A turbine made by manufacturer Vestas was deemed unsuitable for the project, and the remaining manufacturer, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, told Invenergy in June that it was increasing the cost of its turbine, Invenergy said.",
      "Invenergy said it has invested millions of dollars into the project and remains committed to it. The project must pay $105 million toward the cost of a facility to build monopiles, the tower-like foundations of wind turbines, in Paulsboro.",
      "Opponents of offshore wind seized on the new request as more proof the industry is not economically feasible, particularly with Donald Trump, an offshore wind foe, soon to return to the White House.",
      "\u201cWe can only draw one logical conclusion: the Trump administration threatens the lifeblood of the offshore wind industry, namely, large government subsidies and less regulation,\u201d the group Protect Our Coast NJ said in a statement.",

      "Attentive Energy Two would be built 42 miles (67 kilometers) off Seaside Heights and would not be visible from the shoreline. It is a joint venture between Paris-based TotalEnergies and London-based Corio Generation and would power over 650,000 homes.",
      "Atlantic Shores, a joint partnership between Shell New Energies US LLC and EDF-RE Offshore Development LLC, would generate enough energy to power 700,000 homes.

The company has previously said the closest turbines will be at least 12.8 miles (20 kilometers) from shore.",
      "Some observers say it might not be easy to completely thwart the industry, particularly projects that are already operating or that have received the required government approvals.",
      "Paulina O'Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, said the industry's future is promising.",
      "\u201cThere is no shortage of challenges to advancing a new industry through market-wide shifts, but the fundamentals of offshore wind in New Jersey remain strong,\" she said.",

      "A Pennsylvania court says the secretary of state has the authority to direct counties not to allow \u201cunauthorized third party access\u201d to voting machines or risk having those machines decertified and unable to be deployed for elections",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania court on Tuesday ruled 6-1 that the secretary of state has the authority to direct counties not to allow \u201cunauthorized third party access\u201d to voting machines or risk having those machines decertified and unable to be deployed for elections.",
      "The Commonwealth Court said the Department of State does not have to reimburse counties when they decertify machines, a defeat for Fulton County in a dispute that arose after two Republican county commissioners permitted Wake Technology Services Inc. to examine and obtain data from Dominion voting machines in 2021.",
      "That led the state elections agency to issue a directive against such third-party access based on concerns it could compromise security. Fulton's machines were decertified as a result of the Wake TSI examination and the secretary of state was sued by the county as well as Republican county commissioners Randy Bunch and Stuart Ulsh.",
      "Fulton had argued it had broad authority over the voting machines, while the secretary of state said that \u201cwould mean that every county board of elections can do whatever it wants\u201d with electronic voting systems under their authority to inspect elections, \u201can absurd and unreasonable result,\u201d wrote Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer for the majority.",
      "She said a 1937 state election law gave county election boards broad power, but state lawmakers amended it \u201cto give the secretary an important role in ensuring statewide consistency and safety\u201d regarding electronic voting systems. The state and local power balance over elections and voting equipment, the majority said, helps \u201cprotect and provide for free and fair and secure elections.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no conflict between those provisions, and it is entirely possible \u2014 indeed necessary \u2014 for county boards of elections to fulfill their powers and duties while heeding the secretary\u2019s report and directives,\u201d Jubelirer wrote for the majority.",
      "The Department of State issued a statement saying it was pleased with the decision and that the adminstration of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro \u201cis committed to ensuring the free and secure administration of elections, and today\u2019s decision recognizes that the secretary is empowered to keep voting systems secure from unauthorized third-parties seeking to undermine confidence in Pennsylvania\u2019s elections.\u201d",
      "The Fulton County board, through chief clerk Stacey Shives, declined comment about the decision. Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for Fulton County's lawyers, Tom Carroll and Jim Stein.",
      "The officials in Fulton, a 15,000 population county in rural central Pennsylvania, brought in Wake TSI and allowed another outside inspection as part of an effort to find the sort of election fraud that then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed existed after his 2020 reelection loss. Fulton heavily supported Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns. Ulsh is no longer an elected county commissioner.",
      "Fulton replaced the voting machines, which were impounded by the court during the dispute over allowing others to access them.",

Maybe it was the December day that a food scholar was heard to utter, \u201cEveryone can kind of see their needs met by pickles.\u201d",
      "Or perhaps it was just a couple weeks ago, when Instagram chef itsmejuliette (no stranger to online pickle activities) posted a cheeky challenge on her \u201ccooking with no rules\u201d feed: \u201cthis is your sign to surprise your neighbor with a pickle wreath.\u201d More than 70,000 people liked her style, or at least her post.",
      "At the intersection of health and edginess, traditionalism and hipsterism, global culture and the American stomach, the pickle in 2024 found itself caught in a mealstrom of words like \u201cviral\u201d and \u201ctrending\u201d just as its food-as-fetish-object cousins \u2014 bacon and ranch dressing, notably \u2014 experienced in years past.

Pickleback shots at the bar. Pickle juice and Dr. Pepper, heaven help us. Corn puffs colored and flavored like pickles and called, naturally, Pickle Balls. In Pittsburgh, the cradle of the modern American pickle (talkin\u2019 to you, H.J. Heinz), a summer festival called Picklesburgh that draws aficionados of the sour and the puckery from several states away for copious amounts of pickle beer washed down by brine, or vice versa.",
      "As 2025 begins, two possible conclusions present themselves. First: The previously nobrow pickle has embedded its sour self at the nucleus of the American gastro-zeitgeist for the foreseeable future. Second: This maybe has played itself out, and the pickle has (to mix a metaphor) jumped the shark.",
      "But let's not get ahead of ourselves.",
      "\u201cI think pickling in general has had a resurgence,\u201d says Emily Ruby, who would know. She is a curator and expert on the history of the Heinz company for the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, a couple miles downriver from this industrial borough where Henry J. Heinz churned out his first packaged pickles in the 19th century. Indeed, pickles are now a $3.1 billion annual market in the United States and growing consistently.",
      "Let\u2019s dispense with the obvious hanging question. In short: Sour nation, sour mood, sour foods? Maybe just a little.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a scary few years for a lot of people. In 2024 we needed something we could agree on. Maybe it\u2019s pickles,\u201d says Alex Plakias, an associate professor at Hamilton College in New York who teaches the philosophy of food.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at how the pickle could be all things to all people,\u201d says Plakias, whose most recent book is about awkwardness. \u201cAll these different food identities in 2024, and no matter who you think of, pickles can be for them.\u201d",
      "To see how that might have happened, we can look to the potent pathways of marketing and social media.",
      "The garden-variety American cucumber pickle is crunchy and sour, with an aggressive taste of its own but a clear elasticity that accommodates other \u201cflavor profiles\u201d (Ghost pepper pickles! Garlic pickles! Horseradish pickles! Bread and butter chips!). They\u2019re also absurdly low fat \u2014 the rare food trend that\u2019s not outright bad for you \u2014 and some offer the probiotic benefits of fermentation. Key marketing points all.",
      "From a positioning perspective, somehow the pickle exists at the crossroads of homey-slash-traditional (Mom, Lower East Side, preserves, harvests) and edgy-slash-slightly subversive (sour, intense flavors, startup pickle factories in reclaimed industrial neighborhoods).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I come from a long line of picklers. But I realized that a cucumber is a blank slate and you get to paint it with all kinds of different brines and spices and salts and sugars,\u201d says John Patterson, who founded Pittsburgh Pickle with his brothers out of a church kitchen a decade ago.",
      "\u201cA pickle is something you can rely on and count on,\u201d he says. \u201cA pickle is always funny, for some reason. A pickle is never nefarious or mean. It\u2019s a peaceful, wholesome business to be in.\u201d",
      "(Of the cucumber itself, he has this to say: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like God intended them to be pickled.\u201d)",
      "The pickle is also, let\u2019s be candid, usually green and bumpy and intrinsically unattractive. That means even social-video newbies don\u2019t need precision lighting to crank out reasonably compelling pickle content.",
      "Credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 TikTok for some of the frenzy. Watching the meticulous chronicling of pickle-cake baking, pickle-wreath making and pickle-pizza crafting, you get the sense the social platform was made as much for dills as for dancing. Pickle videos there regularly top 2 million viewers, and as of this week TikTok reported more than 251 million pieces of pickle content for the snacking.",
      "Then there is the Great Glickle Surge of 2024 \u2014 another social media oddity that involves someone pouring \u201cedible glitter\u201d (who knew?) into a jar of pickles and making \u201cglickles\u201d \u2014 ostensibly a sexier, blingier, even Instagrammier version of pickles (again, who knew?).",
      "Finally, COVID likely played a pivotal role. After years of rising locavore ethos, the pandemic\u2019s forced inward focus in 2020 and 2021 led many Americans to revisit DIY approaches to food, including baking sourdough bread and, yes, pickling things. It\u2019s what Nora Rubel, who researches food and culture, calls \u201can embrace of \u2018grandmothercore\u2019 culture\u201d by, well, grandchildren. \u201cGen Z is taking pickles as their thing. This is the new avocado toast,\u201d says Rubel, a professor of Jewish studies at the University of Rochester.",
      "\u201cPickles are also kind of funny. They\u2019re just sort of goofy. You can make a lot of puns about pickles. It\u2019s intense flavor, but there\u2019s also a kind of silliness about them,\u201d Rubel says. (She also was heard to say: \u201cThe sweet pickle is something that\u2019s very deceptive and upsetting to me.\u201d)",
      "If you\u2019re seeing a thread emerging, it\u2019s this \u2014 not entirely new, but worth repeating: Packaged food is no longer positioned as merely something to eat. Instead, like the most immersive restaurants, these days it often presents itself as a multimedia experience \u2014 something to be talked about and reveled in, to join likeminded communities over, to incorporate into your own personality. Lifestyle pickles, as it were.",
      "\u201cIt symbolizes how we engage with food in daily life and with each other in 2024,\u201d says MinJi (MJ) Kim, an assistant professor of communication at Flagler College in Florida who studies how media affects people\u2019s food choices.",
      "\u201cSour has duality. When milk or meat or vegetables develop a sour smell, it signals spoilage. It\u2019s a natural warning system. We equate sourness with risk,\u201d Kim says. \u201cOn the other hand, when sourness is intentional \u2014 lemons, cider vinegar, greek yogurt \u2014 it becomes a marker of health and appeal. It shifts the perception of sourness from risk to something acceptable.\u201d",
      "There you have it: sourness as acceptable, delicious, even worthy of obsession.",
      "So as the popularity of pickleball \u2014 no direct relation \u2014 continues to spike, as fried pickles transcend their novelty status and become bar-food stalwarts across the land, and as someone's pet plays with one of 26 pickle holiday toys, we\u2019ll leave you with two dueling thoughts as America crunches its way into a new year.",
      "From Rubel, this: \u201cYou can get pickle everything now. This is really my time.\u201d",
      "And from Delish, the food website, this: \"Can we give pickles a break in 2025? They\u2019re tired. And we\u2019re tired for them.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There are few clearer signs of the destructive power that Hurricane Beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital, Bridgetown.",
      "Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken.",
      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",
      "Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic.",
      "\"I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,\" she argues. \"I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want.\"",
      "\"I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,\" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, \"then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing.\"",
      "For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean.",
      "It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change \u2013 urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations.",
      "On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold.",
      "Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes.",
      "\"It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much.\"",
      "By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management.",
      "I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean.",
      "\"The whole landscape has changed entirely,\" he replied. \"Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern.\"",
      "Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 01:35:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The business and trade select committee says the schemes are so poorly designed, the application process is like a second trial.",
    "story": [
      "A group of MPs says compensation is not being paid quickly enough for the victims of the Post Office scandal and is calling for the government to face financial penalties if the process doesn't speed up.",
      "The Business and Trade Select Committee said binding timeframes were needed, with any money arising from missed deadlines going to the claimants if they weren't met.",
      "The committee also called for the Post Office to be removed from its role in the compensation schemes, and asked for more transparency over how much it was paying for lawyers.",
      "The government said it was \"working tirelessly\" to settle claims \"at a faster rate than ever before\".",
      "Committee chairman Liam Byrne MP said: \"The fault lies with the Post Office, but ultimately government is the shareholder in the Post Office and acts on our behalf\".",
      "The government is already looking at the Post Office's role in the compensation schemes.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted and convicted based on information from a faulty accounting system, Horizon, which made it look like money was missing.",
      "Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined, and some have since died.",
      "One of those accused, Seema Misra, was eight weeks pregnant when she was wrongfully imprisoned.",
      "Speaking to the BBC after she was made an OBE in the King's New Year list for her role in campaigning for justice, she said it was an acknowledgement of the \"scale of the injustice and scandal\".",
      "The scandal \"still hasn't been sorted out\", she said, recalling the \"really, really difficult time\" she had had since her legal battle with the Post Offices started in 2008, three years after she had bought the Post Office in West Byfleet in Surrey.",
      "She served four-and-a-half months in Bronzefield prison and gave birth to her second son wearing an electronic tag.",
      "'Poorly designed'",
      "A public inquiry in to the scandal heard final submissions in December, where it took evidence from lawyers representing the Post Office, Horizon's creators Fujitsu, and the Department for Business, as well as victims and former Post Office bosses.",
      "The select committee's report, which comes a year after an ITV drama about the scandal catapulted the issue to the public's attention, said the redress schemes were still \"poorly designed\" and payments were still \"not fast enough\".",
      "It found the application process was akin to a second trial for the victims, adding that lawyers administering the schemes were making millions whilst the vast majority of the money set aside for redress had still to be paid out.",
      "The committee's recommendations include providing upfront legal advice for victims and hard deadlines for administrators to approve claims - with financial penalties if they take too long.",
      "Only around \u00a3499m of the budgeted \u00a31.8bn has been paid out so far, to more than 3,000 claimants. The committee said that meant 72% of the budget had still not paid.",
      "Many of those with the most complicated claims have still to be fully settled.",
      "\"This is quite simply, wrong, wrong, wrong\", Byrne said.",
      "\"There are still thousands of victims who have not had the redress to which they are entitled.",
      "\"This is the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history,\" he said, adding that there are \"eye-watering legal costs which are, frankly, going through the roof.\"",
      "Talking to the BBC, he said that  \"for every \u00a34 that the taxpayer is paying out in redress payments, \u00a31 is going to the lawyers\".",
      "Byrne added that hard deadlines and fines would help the government and the Post Office to \"get a grip\".",
      "A Post Office spokesperson said the firm was \"focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible\", adding that its spending on external law firms was kept \"under constant review\".",
      "\"Our chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the government, and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "There are four compensation schemes for victims and two are overseen by the Post Office.",
      "The government's Post Office minister Gareth Thomas said in December that the Labour government was considering taking over responsibility for the schemes from the company.",
      "The Post Office told the select committee in December that legal fees had made up \u00a3136m of the cost of administering the Post Office-led schemes since 2020, which is around 27% of the compensation paid out.",
      "Some of the committee's recommendations for improvement were previously rejected by the former Tory government.",
      "Hard deadlines attached to financial penalties were dismissed as having \"no positive effect\" on speeding up claims and \"might unjustly penalise solicitors for issues out of their control\", the former government said in May.",
      "Meanwhile, Hudgell Solicitors, which represents hundreds of former sub-postmasters, has welcomed the committee's recommendations, saying they would simplify and speed up the compensation schemes by removing \"unnecessary obstacles to justice\" which it said it had seen repeated over hundreds of cases.",

      "Single bus fares in London with Transport for London will also remain at \u00a31.75 and those in Greater Manchester at \u00a32. These regions are excluded from the broader fare cap as their funding is structured differently.",
      "Alison Edwards, director of policy at bus and coach industry body the Confederation of Passenger Transport, suggested that many people who use bus services would continue to pay well under \u00a33 per journey.",
      "She said that commuters and regular passengers often opt for season tickets which are cheaper.",
      "Many single fares on shorter routes will remain below \u00a33, she added.",

      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "South Korea's acting leader has ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations, a day after 179 people were killed in the deadliest plane crash on its soil.",
      "The Jeju Air plane burst into flames as it crash-landed in South Korea's Muan International Airport, killing everyone onboard save for two crew members.",
      "Acting President Choi Sang-mok has asked investigators to promptly disclose their findings to bereaved families.",
      "His request also comes as another Jeju Air flight turned back to Seoul shortly after takeoff on Monday, due to an unidentified landing-gear issue.",
      "On Monday, the Jeju Air plane departed from Gimpo International Airport at 06:35 local time (21:35 GMT Sunday) and returned less than an hour later after realising a mechanical defect caused by the landing-gear issue, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.",
      "Landing gear refers to the set of wheels and other parts of the plane which support the plane during takeoff, taxiing and landing.",
      "The aircraft that turned back was a Boeing B737-800, the same model as the one involved in the disaster on Sunday.",

      "The 179 passengers on flight 7C2216 were aged between three and 78 years old, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s, according to Yonhap news agency. Two Thai nationals are among the dead and the rest are believed to be South Korean, authorities have said.",

    "story": [
      "Even if you were lucky enough to get a new console or games this Christmas, you've probably got your eye on some upcoming releases.",
      "And 2025 is shaping up to be a big one.",
      "Most agree that 2024 was a painful year for the games industry, with tens of thousands of layoffs and worldwide studio closures.",
      "There's a hope that things will bounce back - at least in part - next year.",
      "And two huge releases in particular are likely to cut through in a big way.",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6",
      "A cultural moment, a day millions of gamers have been awaiting for a very, very long time.",
      "The release of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).",
      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",
      "A new Nintendo Switch?",
      "Here's what we know, officially, about Nintendo's next console.",
      "It exists.",
      "Your current Switch games will work on it.",
      "And that's it.",
      "There's no official name yet, but fans have been calling it the Nintendo Switch 2.",
      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",
      "\"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"I think they've learned a lot of lessons since then.\"",
      "More breakout hits",
      "Some of 2024's biggest success stories came from small, independent developers.",
      "The most notable was Balatro - an addictive, poker-inspired card game that ended the year in the running for high-profile game of the year awards.",
      "Journalist Rachel Watts, who hosts the Indieventure podcast, feels that has helped to set the stage for more breakout success this year.",
      "\"There's been so many great indies this year,\" she says.",
      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",
      "\"If Balatro can knock elbows with some of the biggest titles of the year, then I'm hoping other other indies will.\"",
      "esports Olympics",
      "There's another big moment to watch in 2025: the first Olympic Esports Games will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it's an important moment because the Olympic movement has traditionally not been too keen on esports,\" says George.",
      "After years of campaigning the International Olympics Committee agreed a 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia to host the gaming version.",
      "The first esports World Cup took place in the kingdom this summer, and George says the event \"didn't really cut through\" to a wider audience.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see whether or not the eSports Olympics with the official IOC branding and the official Olympic movement branding behind it has a different impact,\" says George.",
      "Some fans, players and commentators boycotted the World Cup in protest over Saudi Arabia's human rights records.",
      "George says the esports Olympics will revive conversations about sportswashing - the idea that Saudi Arabia uses its vast wealth to invest in sports and entertainment to improve its international reputation - something it's denied.",
      "\"You have this really interesting thing,\" says George.",
      "\"Your big esports moment - esports becomes an Olympic sport.",
      "\"That's really interesting. But the only way it's basically been able to happen is because Saudi Arabia's bankrolled it.",

      "Along with other farmers, Mr Macharia brings sacks of his bright red coffee cherries to the local processing plant, where they are weighed and treated.",
      "A machine removes the red husks, and the pale beans inside are washed and passed along concrete channels, ending up on lines of drying platforms that sweep across the valley.",
      "Here, workers categorise the beans into grades, the highest destined for the coffee houses of Europe.",
      "\"We call coffee the black gold around here,\" Mr Macharia, whose farm covers 2.5 hectares (six acres) , told the BBC.",
      "He grows the Kenya AA coffee beans, which are prized worldwide for their high quality, full body, deep aromas and fruity flavour.",
      "The crop has been part of these lush highlands since the late 1890s, when British colonial settlers introduced it.",
      "Now, the area is famous for its unique, top-rated coffee.",
      "Growing the berries is labour intensive - picking, pruning, weeding, spraying, fertilising and transporting the products.",
      "\"Coffee requires your full-time concentration, especially when it starts to bloom,\" Mr Macharia said.",

      "The price of a single cup of coffee in a chic European caf\u00e9, typically $4 (\u00a33.20), highlights a stark disparity when compared to the earnings of many Kenyan coffee labourers, who make at most $2.30 a day.",
      "Edita Mwangi, who harvests coffee cherries on the red earth hillside overlooking the processing plant, confirms this.",
      "\"They don't know the poverty we suffer. You have to struggle day and night just to survive,\" she said.",

      "Farmers feel the trading system between Kenya and Europe - the world's largest coffee market - has been stacked against them for many years.",
      "But now, a new threat looms, jeopardising farmers' ability to make a living - climate change.",
      "Coffee trees are extremely sensitive to small differences in temperature and weather conditions.",
      "They also need specific climatic conditions like humid temperatures and ample rainfall to grow.",
      "\"Climate change is a major challenge for our coffee farmers,\" says John Murigi, the chairman of the Komothai Coffee Society, which represents 8,000 coffee farmers like Mr Macharia.",
      "Cold temperatures and erratic rainfall are having a devastating impact on the delicate coffee plants, said Mr Murigi.",
      "As a result, \"coffee production has decreased over the last few years\".",
      "He added that climate change was intensifying the spread of diseases in coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said there had been a significant increase in coffee leaf miners, bugs that feed on coffee leaves, and coffee berry disease, a destructive fungal infection that can wipe out more than 80% of crops.",
      "To deal with the increasing outbreaks, farmers are resorting to using herbicides and insecticides that can damage soil quality in the long term and also pose health risks.",
      "To produce a single cup of coffee can require up to 140 litres of water - including the water to grow the plants.",

      "Farmer Joseph Kimani told the BBC that the \"river levels have gone down a lot\" due to erratic weather, such as periods of drought and heavy rains.",
      "He said that because of the lack of rain, farmers are forced to use more river water.",
      "But this increased reliance on river water, driven by the lack of rainfall, may be further straining the already limited water supply.",
      "While Mr Murigi acknowledges the rise in water use by coffee farmers, he denies this is why the river is drying up.",
      "However, with 23 coffee societies in this region, a significant amount of water is clearly being used in the coffee growing process in Kiambu County.",
      "Komothia's story is not unique. As global temperatures and droughts increase, good coffee will become difficult to grow in all parts of the world.",
      "Coffee can only be grown in the \"coffee belt\" - tropical regions around the world in areas typically located at an altitude of between 1,000m and 2,000m.",
      "In recent years, climate change has led to a shortage of global coffee supplies and an increase in the price of coffee due to drought and crop failures in several key coffee-producing nations such as Brazil and Vietnam.",
      "A survey by Fairtrade International, the organisation behind Fairtrade labels, found that 93% of Kenyan coffee farmers are already experiencing the effects of climate change.",
      "The coffee industry in Kenya is a key source of employment, providing jobs for an estimated 150,000 people.",
      "To protect the industry, coffee farmers in areas like Komothai are experimenting with climate adaptation techniques, such as planting trees to provide extra shade for the coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said it is only through addressing both the climate and economic challenges faced by Kenyan coffee farmers that they can have a sustainable future.",

      "They contacted watchdogs, including energy regulator Ofgem and water regulator Ofwat, before Christmas asking them to submit proposals by mid-January.",
      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the letter \"says all you need to know\" about Sir Keir's government, claiming he has to \"beg his own government to create growth after Labour's damaging Budget\".",
      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",
      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",

      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "This has been a miserable year for Boeing. Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.",
      "Even its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.",
      "On top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company.",
      "\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.",
      "Sam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the 737 Max is built. It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record.",
      "Earlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.",
      "\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"",
      "His allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.",
      "During the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings.",
      "David Calhoun, who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"",
      "Since then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.",
      "But according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.",
      "\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"",
      "Boeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"",
      "Another Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line. Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.",
      "But Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.",
      "He believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements.",
      "\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"",
      "Arguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.",
      "But some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.",
      "Crashes and the 737 Max",
      "Boeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.",
      "\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"",
      "Moments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.",
      "Ms Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.",
      "What had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident.",
      "The passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.",
      "What made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.",
      "Since its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.",
      "In late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed.",
      "Both accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.",
      "In practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.",
      "Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?",
      "Some critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"",
      "In the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months as regulators examined every aspect of its design.",
      "The company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.",
      "The incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.",
      "In particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body.",
      "These included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.",
      "But the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.",
      "The sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news.",
      "US politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"",
      "The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'",
      "After the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".",
      "The aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues.",
      "It also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.",
      "On 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.",
      "There were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.",
      "But weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - went on strike over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.",
      "The walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "In the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.",
      "\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.",
      "The result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.",
      "Boeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.",
      "Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout",
      "All of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.",
      "Boeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its European rival Airbus, it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years.",
      "In the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.",
      "For its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.",
      "Yet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.",
      "Meanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.",
      "The current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.",
      "According to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.",
      "\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"",
      "A 'borderline miraculous' revival?",
      "In early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.",
      "\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"",
      "But for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.",
      "\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.",
      "\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"",
      "Some observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.",
      "\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"",
      "A complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.",
      "But others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks.",
      "\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.",
      "\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"",
      "The stakes, he insists, could not be higher.",

      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "The government previously said the tax would apply to all payments made for the January term after 29 July 2024.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",
      "Campaigners had argued that VAT should not be added to fees for small faith schools, international schools or for families with children with special educational needs.",
      "But only those with a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names the specific school will continue to be exempt.",
      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "In October 2024, the organisation said it would press ahead with plans for a legal challenge against the policy. It argues the tax changes breach the European Convention on Human Rights on two counts: the prohibition of discrimination, and the right to education.",
      "The Treasury said it would not comment on potential litigation."

      "Previous research carried out by academics at Durham University and the University of Sheffield suggests that women are more likely to experience blurred boundaries between work and family life.",
      "It found that women working remotely were more likely to value being present for their families, while men were less inclined to interrupt their work schedules to address family needs.",
      "Its researchers suggested, however, that remote work can help employees with a better work-family balance if they are well supported.",
      "\"Businesses do have a role to play in that,\" Ms Crosbie said on Tuesday.",

      "He says: \"When you come onto the NICU, everyone's on about the mum, and making sure they're OK. That's great, it's what's needed, but then you kind of feel a little bit left out, so it's nice and reassuring to know that there is people like Humber Dads out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Could the influence of pornography, OnlyFans and so-called \"natural family planning\" techniques explain the drop in teenagers' use of condoms?",
      "YMCA sexual health educator Sarah Peart said some boys were not willing to use them \"because they're not seeing that in pornography\".",
      "She said young girls were often \"targeted on social media\" by those endorsing hormone-free, period-tracking apps to avoid unwanted pregnancies.",
      "Young people have also said that controversial OnlyFans adult content creators set poor examples, who made headlines after bragging of having sex with several young men in a day.",
      "Footage also emerged of one OnlyFans creator saying she had not used condoms during oral sex, putting her at risk of HIV.",
      "\"We've had multiple young people say \"natural family planning\" is their main form of contraception,\" said Ms Peart, adding that the lack of positive role models and influencers was a challenge for those providing sex education.",
      "The YMCA sessions at schools, colleges and youth services attempt to inform, bust myths, discuss healthy relationships, but also hammer home the message that pregnancy is not the only risk.",
      "\"It's such a difficult barrier convincing young people that birth control isn't enough, and that you do need to protect yourself from STIs (sexually transmitted infections).\"",
      "She added they would also explain that \"natural family planning\" was not always reliable, \"especially at that age when maybe periods aren't regular and young people don't tend to be the most strict with keeping notes\".",
      "\"Our sessions also cover pornography and OnlyFans does sometimes come up as a strand of that.",
      "\"We try to educate young people to make their own healthy choices - and hopefully that includes not opening an OnlyFans account, but we can only provide the education.\"",
      "When BBC Wales asked young people for their thoughts, while many were too uncomfortable to speak publicly, most said buying condoms was seen as  too embarrassing.",
      "Liz Vieira, 20, from Llandysul, Ceredigion, said the decline in use of condoms - reported by the World Health Organization - did not surprise her given the prominence of adult content creators and their attitudes towards risk.",
      "\"I guess it's up to them, but as long as it's not meaning women in relationships are having a hard time. Because it sends a message it's OK to use women as you please. I don't think that's a good thing,\" she said.",
      "Mason Down and Dylan Steggles, from Cardiff, said sex education in school was also limited.",
      "\"We only had two days of it at school,\" said 18-year-old Dylan. \"And that was only an hour or two each time.\"",
      "\"There's more of that content online now [porn] so you can easily access it at a young age, which might influence how young people feel about condoms,\" said Mason.",
      "The sessions delivered by YMCA for young people include information on the C-Card scheme, which is a supported service across the UK, providing training on sexual health awareness, as well as free condoms, lubrication and dental dams.",
      "\"Condoms are really expensive, so it's a fantastic service to make them accessible, but also acceptable, and not some weird, dark hidden corner of the pub toilets,\" said Ms Peart.",
      "She is aware of fears the scheme could be seen as encouraging under-age sex but said research suggested more information at a younger age was likely to delay that.",
      "\"We try and persuade them to wait until they're at least 16. But if they are going to, then we can make sure they can do it in a safe way.\"",
      "The World Health Organization recently reported that 56% of 15-year-old girls in Wales, and 49% of boys, had not used a condom the last time they had sex.",
      "It comes amid a rise in STIs in the past year: 22% in chlamydia, 127% in gonorrhoea, and 14% in syphilis.",
      "Ellie Whelan and Megan Grimley, both 21, from Cardiff, said the move away from condoms surprised them given more of their peers had turned away from the pill or coil as forms of contraception.",
      "Use of long-acting, reversible contraception - such as an intra-uterine device (IUD) or hormonal implant - has fallen 22% in the last five years, with terminations up by a third.",
      "\"I think it's a lot to do with false information or bad experiences - or people are too scared to get information and talk about it,\" said Megan.",
      "How do I know if I have an STI?",
      "Testing is the best way to find out if you have a sexually transmitted infection.",
      "The Sexual Health Wales service offers a free test kit for over-16s which can be sent and returned by post or collected from community venues.",
      "Sexual health clinics across Wales also provide testing and support.",
      "Infections can take several weeks after contact to show up in a test.",
      "HIV takes seven weeks to be detected, hepatitis C and B can take 12 weeks or more, and chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show up within a fortnight.",
      "But it is not solely an issue for young adults. Ms Peart said the YMCA sessions explain the range of contraception available, but at the back of most classrooms is a teacher also taking notes, as the gap in STI knowledge in particular is on \"a national, societal level\".",
      "It is also reflected in the rise in sexually transmitted infections in the over-40s, according to Public Health Wales's Zoe Couzens, as people enter new relationships after divorce or bereavement.",
      "\"And I'm not putting an upper age on that \u2013 we've had a 72-year-old with chlamydia,\" she said.",
      "\"It's about ensuring the message goes out across all age groups.",
      "\"But the issue for the women especially is that pregnancy is not the concern they have any more, so they're not going to take the precautions. So that's another group that needs to be educated.\"",
      "Arguably the rise in cases is a result of increased testing, as the free \"test and post\" service by Public Health Wales has made that far more accessible.",
      "\"Chlamydia is the most common [STI] in Wales, followed by gonorrhoea - and while it's all treatable with antibiotics, gonorrhoea is a nasty little bug that is developing resistance to antibiotics.",
      "\"Twenty years ago we had two cases of syphilis in Wales - last year it was 507.",
      "\"It tends to be a silent infection, but it can develop into neuro syphilis and cause cardiac problems.\"",
      "Given other STIs can cause infertility, pain and pelvic inflammatory disease, the notion they are easily remedied is one many professionals wish to tackle.",
      "How do you get a sexually transmitted infection?",
      "Chlamydia is passed on through unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, sharing sex toys, or genital-to-genital contactGonorrhoea can be spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex without a condom, or the sharing of sex toysHIV is passed in infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal or rectal secretions, blood and breast milk, and the most common way to pass it on is through sex without a condom or sharing drug equipmentSyphilis is transmitted during unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, or through sharing sex toys, and it is also possible to pass on from mother to babyHerpes is highly contagious and is passed by skin-to-skin contact like vaginal, anal or oral sex, sharing sex toys, or oral sex with someone who has a cold soreGenital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",

      "Genital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",
      "What are the symptoms of an STI?",
      "Chlamydia: often described as a silent infection as most people do not have obvious signs. Symptoms can include pain when urinating, unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum. Women may get pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex and in between periods, while men can have pain and swelling in the testicles.",
      "Gonorrhoea: some people have no symptoms, but those who do may have a yellow or green discharge; a burning sensation when they wee and pain or tenderness in the stomach.",
      "Syphilis: many people won't have symptoms. But for those that do, it will start with a small, painless ulcer in the mouth or genitals, followed by a rash. If left untreated, the infection can result in visual impairment, dementia and death. In pregnancy it can also lead to miscarriages, still births and infant mortality.",
      "Herpes: again, some people have no symptoms, but they can include small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Blisters and ulcers can also be on the cervix; it can cause vaginal discharge, pain when having a wee, as well as general flu-like symptoms.",
      "Genital warts: in women they start as small, gritty-feeling lumps that become larger. In men the warts will feel firm and raised, with a rough surface. They can be single warts or grow in clusters.",

    "story": [
      "James Hunt used to spend his days commuting to London, where he ran a successful marketing firm.",
      "But his children Jude and Tommy were diagnosed as autistic when they were toddlers, and he later decided to care for them and his parents full-time.",
      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",
      "It's somewhere for people in the community to visit, we have a sensory room in the shop and we get lots of parents coming in who want to have a chat.",
      "Everyone working in the shop is a parent, carer or is autistic, so they can share their experiences with customers.",
      "'I've learned to cherish the simple things'",
      "I always try to focus on the positives and not think too far ahead but there are days when my mind runs away with me.",
      "It will be a huge challenge when the boys leave school when they are 19.",
      "That's massively scary because suddenly you have to trust a whole new bunch of people.",
      "There is a part-time college I hope they can go to but it's a huge unknown and there will be big decisions to make.",
      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",
      "It has taught me to cherish and enjoy the simple things and I just want the boys to be happy.",
      "Looking back at how I felt when they were diagnosed, I would like to tell myself it's all going to be OK.",
      "Those first few years can be a really scary and emotional time. You feel like you have no idea what you're doing.",
      "Don't bottle everything up, find people to open up to. Your friends and family want to help, they just don't know how to yet.",

      "One of the first productions is a radio play written by broadcaster Nick Ahad, and its theme is Bradford's battered reputation.",
      "\"The working title for this play was 'Bradford, City of Culture?!' because we knew that's what the reaction would be when people found out we would be the City of Culture for 2025,\" he explains.",
      "Ahad eventually settled on the excellent title Bilal and Ted's Bradfordian Adventure, and it's on BBC Sounds. One of the actors is Seeta Wrightson, a comedian from the city.",
      "\"I think it's really unfairly got a bad rep. And I think that's because in the news or on social media, people don't want to talk about good things.\"",
      "'Why is Bradford so\u2026?'",
      "Wrightson's not wrong.",
      "The headlines about Bradford are often brutal. In recent months, news stories have declared it Britain's gloomiest city (because it has the least sunshine) and the second most miserable place to live.",
      "Type the words \"Why is Bradford so\u2026.?\" into a search engine and see what happens.  The odds are you will probably get the following autofill options - \"bad\", \"dangerous\" and \"poor\".",
      "And it's not just the opinions of people outside the city. Dr Paul Sullivan of Bradford University has carried out research into the stigma. His hometown is Ireland's Cork, a place where its comedians make fun of its high opinion of itself. Bradford, he discovered, was rather different.",
      "\"What surprised me was... the almost lack of civic pride.",
      "\"Even reading the local newspaper, some of the headlines can be very upbeat, and beneath it are just loads of comments that, 'This is a disaster, it'll just never work, Bradford is doomed'.\"",
      "But Dr Sullivan is a fan.",
      "\"I love the city. I fell in love with Bradford straight away. I love the city centre, the beautiful countryside.  And it was really quite a surprise to me to see that level of negativity.\"",
      "Much of it, he believes, is rooted in an external and almost \"ideological hostility\" to the city's ethnic diversity.",
      "\"I think there's a reluctance to admit that Bradford can succeed. A desire for Bradford to fail.\"",
      "However, in the face of this antagonism, something is, he feels, developing.",
      "In his recent interviews with residents, \"there was a real sense of pride, in their sense of belonging\".",
      "It was a topic Ahad and Wrightson also raised. Diversity has become utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I'm Bangladeshi and English. My wife's Pakistani and Indian, and you sort of don't have to explain here,\" says Ahad.",
      "\"Like 100%,\" Wrightson adds. \"I'm mixed heritage, my mum's Indian, my dad's English. And growing up, it wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "City of Culture has for many become a moment to look beyond the problems and champion what's growing out of its diversity.",
      "People feel welcomed",
      "Natalie Davies, an actor and writer from Bradford, is creating a play about the city's nightlife.",
      "\"The stigma that's been attached for years is old now, and that's not what Bradford is.",
      "\"I'm very lucky. I've worked in television, I've worked in film, I've worked in theatre and radio, and every time I go on to a set, I always champion Bradford.",
      "\"This is actually a great place, and the thing about it is anybody from anywhere could come to Bradford and feel like they belong and we hold that. People come and completely feel welcomed.",
      "\"It's beautiful.\"",
      "City of Culture has also been a chance for people to take stock of Bradford's cultural history and the famous names that have come from here.",
      "Among them are artist David Hockney, playwright JB Priestley, composer Delius and the Bronte sisters.",
      "\"Emily Bronte, you just take it for granted that she's from Bradford,\" says Wrightson.",
      "For her, City of Culture has been a moment to look at what makes the city special.  And again and again, talking to younger Bradfordians, while some might mention the Brontes, the spectacular Victorian architecture, the first free school meals or the diversity - almost everyone seems to agree that the city's food is key.",
      "Of course, no two people ever seem to agree as to where you can get the best curry, but perhaps one of the best known restaurants is Akbar's, famous for the creation of the giant hanging naan.",
      "Created to save space on a table, the family naan grew to a size that has defeated even the largest Yorkshire appetite.",
      "\"People have tried. None have succeeded,\" says Samad Iqbal, who started working at Akbar's aged 15 and is a proud ambassador for a city that describes itself as the Capital of Curry.",
      "\"Some people call it elephant ears. Some people call it a Christmas tree. But this family naan has gone worldwide.",
      "\"I am very proud of Bradford, I'm born and bred here. It's a fantastic place to live, a fantastic place to eat. It's places like this which show the true spirit of Bradford.\"",
      "It appears Bradford 2025 has already begun to have an effect. It has, says Dr Sullivan, encouraged people to talk positively about the city.",
      "\"In the last couple of years we have seen a change. I am speaking from opinion here now rather than research, but I think we have seen a shift towards civic pride, and I think the catalyst for that really coming to fruition will be Bradford 2025.\"",

    "story": [
      "Later this month, two multiplex cinemas within 20 miles of each other will close down.",
      "But while one of them will get a new lease of life with a new operator, one will be demolished to be replaced by a storage site.",
      "What is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.",
      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",
      "What cinemas have been closing?",
      "The Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.",
      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",
      "But during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.",
      "In 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.",
      "Irish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.",
      "Cineworld was unable to find a buyer and instead last year announced that a number of sites would close, including in Bedford.",
      "Last month the company announced a further six sites would close \u2013 including in Northampton \u2013 and said it would pull out of a leisure centre in Colchester.",
      "The site in Northampton will be converted into an Odeon. That operator also recently opened a site in Peterborough.",
      "But the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.",
      "Why have cinemas been closing?",
      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",
      "\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"",
      "In 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.",
      "\"We haven't had consistent releases of big tentpole films until we got to November,\" says Mr Gant.",
      "Richard Clifford, programmer at the two-screen Northampton Filmhouse, agrees and says 2024 was \"a challenging year in general for the industry\".",
      "He says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".",
      "Mr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.",
      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",
      "Some of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".",
      "Is smaller the future?",
      "Mr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.",
      "\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.",
      "\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"",
      "But new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".",
      "\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.",
      "He adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".",
      "\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.",
      "But he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"",
      "Mr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".",
      "\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.",
      "Will 2025 be better for cinemas?",
      "Mr Clapp says 2025 looks \"something like the normal film slate\" for large studio films.",
      "\"What still needs to build back is the next tier and more diverse films \u2013 the films that appeal to a broader audience than [the] mainstream blockbusters,\" he says.",
      "He adds that his members \"from the large multiplexes down to the smaller, independent cinemas\" are confident about both this year and next year.",
      "Mr Clifford agrees, saying that 2025's \"line-up is stellar compared with [2024]\".",

      "From superhero blockbusters to Netflix romantic comedies, Scotland has become an increasingly familiar location for Hollywood to use.",

      "Those productions join a lengthy list of films and TV shows filmed in the country over the past decade.",
      "Tourism bosses hope successful productions can see Scotland follow the likes of New Zealand - where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films were shot - and Northern Ireland, which saw a tourism upswing from Game of Thrones fans looking to visit locations used in the fantasy series.",
      "Why does Hollywood like Scotland for filming?",
      "For some films, such as Orkney-set drama The Outrun or smash-hit TV show Outlander, filming on location in Scotland is a natural option given the stories themselves are set there.",
      "Scottish scenery and wilderness is distinctive, and can mostly be accessed relatively quickly from major cities, which helps.",
      "However, the past decade has seen cities across the country stand in for other places - something Ray Tallan, the head of film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, suggests is down to architecture cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh.",
      "He says it \"lends itself beautifully\" to the big screen.",
      "Mr Tallan also points to the increase in studio provision in the country, with the likes of First Stage Studios in Leith and Wardpark Film and Television Studios in Cumbernauld.",
      "Mr Tallan told BBC Scotland News:  \"This gives productions the flexibility to not just use Scotland for its scenery but now also its studio facilities.",
      "\"As more of these productions shoot here successfully, this provides confidence in the sector and an increase in reputation.\"",
      "There is another reason too - money.",
      "Like the rest of the UK, Scotland is able to offer tax breaks to productions, which adds to its appeal, as well as additional funding.",
      "For example, Glasgow City Council gave Warner Bros around \u00a3150,000 to shoot DC Comics film Batgirl in the city - only for the finished movie to never see the light of day after bosses at the studio decided not to release it.",
      "What locations can Scottish cities double as?",
      "Glasgow has been particularly adaptable, with its streets doubling for London in the  Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, as legendary comic book location Gotham City in the opening of comic book adventure The Flash, and as 1960s New York for a parade scene in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.",
      "Cheryl Conway, the head of Screen Commission at Screen Scotland, told BBC Scotland News the country has \"versatility\", which makes it appeal to studios.",
      "Of course, this can work the other way too: cheesy festive romcom A Merry Scottish Christmas used Duns Castle in the Scottish Borders for exterior shots, but nearly the entire film was, despite the title, filmed in Ireland.",
      "What films have been shot in Scotland?",
      "A considerable amount.  Recent fare includes...",

      "Does Scotland's economy benefit from filming?",
      "This is a more complicated issue.",
      "A regular concern when massive productions take over parts of the city is whether the disruption negatively hits local businesses.",
      "When the Batgirl film was axed, Glasgow City Council told the Daily Record that the production still provided \"a very significant economic benefit\" for the wider city.",
      "However, businesses in areas where filming occurred were less convinced, telling the BBC at the time that their trade had been adversely affected.",
      "The Social Recluse clothing shop on King Street in the Trongate area was given \u00a31,000 in compensation after having to close for 10 days for filming - something staff said didn't make up for a \"wasted month\".",
      "Other productions, such as Indiana Jones and the Running Man remake, have seen swathes of Glasgow altered and streets and roads blocked off, raising the question of whether those being directly affected are actually seeing any benefits.",
      "Dr Ewelina Lacka, of the Business School at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland News that economic benefits of films in Scotland were a \"mixed perspective\", particularly in regards to tourism.",
      "She explained: \"It's not only the film being made there but whether certain conditions are met, mainly related to destination management and marketing.",
      "\"It highlights the importance of something like Visit Scotland, in having a marketing strategy implemented before and after filming.\"",
      "What is the Outlander effect on Scottish tourism?",
      "The clearest example of a film or TV production boosting Scotland is Outlander, the hugely popular TV show based on books by American author Diana Gabaldon.",
      "Several companies now offer Outlander tours around Scotland, visiting locations used throughout the long-running series.",
      "Dr Lacka said: \"It's a diversion effect \u2013 people plan trips, and work in the filming locations as part of a wider visit.\"",
      "Mr Tallan agrees, saying: \"Outlander has an amazing reach globally and there is no doubt it has had an impact on tourism at locations where the production is shot.\"",
      "Does the homegrown Scottish film industry benefit from Hollywood productions?",
      "Screen Scotland believes the local film industry gains advantages from visiting big productions.",
      "Ms Conway said it enabled trainees and Scottish crews to gain \"vital experience\" and help secure \"sustainable careers\" in the long term.",
      "Mr Tallan agrees, saying more experienced crew members can move onto big productions, which in turn \"gives that opportunity for new blood to come in\" on smaller shoots.",
      "Where will we see Scotland on screen next?",
      "Glasgow was recently taken over for The Running Man, based on Stephen King's book and already adapted once in a 1980s action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",

      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",

      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",

      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",

      "Female pop artists topped the singles chart for an unprecedented 34 weeks - the highest ever figure.",
      "Twenty-one of those weeks belonged to Sabrina Carpenter, whose hit singles Espresso, Taste and Please, Please, Please dominated the second half of the year.",
      "Women were also responsible for half of the year's biggest-selling albums, with Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department leading the pack.",
      "A break-up album full of caustic kiss-offs and sober reflection, it accumulated more than 783,000 sales by the end of December - more than any artist has managed in a calendar year since Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 sold 2.7 million copies in 2017.",
      "Swift had another three albums among the year's 20 biggest titles: 1989 (Taylor's Version), Lover and Folklore.",
      "There were also places in the year-end top 20 for albums Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard And Soft, Sabrina Carpenter's Short N' Sweet, Chappell Roan's The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess and Charli XCX's Brat - all of which have been nominated for album of the year at the 2025 Grammy Awards.",
      "Brat, whose brash and aggressive dance anthems became a cultural phenomenon, was also one of 12 albums by female artists to top the Official Albums Chart in 2024 (equalling a record set in 2023).",
      "These included Prelude To Ecstasy, the debut album by BBC Sound of 2024 winners The Last Dinner Party; as well as new releases by Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Overall, music consumption in the UK rose by 9.7%, with fans buying or streaming 200.5 million albums (the BPI counts 1,000 streams as the equivalent of one album \"sale\").",
      "Streaming hit a record high, with 199.6 billion songs played over the course of the year.",
      "That's the equivalent of everyone in the country playing 2,920 tracks, or six continuous days of music, on services like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music.",
      "Vinyl sales marked a 17th consecutive year of growth, with 6.7 million records bought. And the decline in CD sales showed signs of slowing down, with purchases falling by just 2.9% to 10.5 million units.",
      "However, the availability of millions of songs at the touch of a button is making it harder for British musicians to compete.",
      "For the first time since records began in 1970, none of the year's top 10 best-selling songs was by an artist from the UK.",
      "Instead, the chart was dominated by US singer-songwriters, including Noah Kahan, whose breakthrough hit Stick Season notched up a total of 1.99m sales (including streams) over the year.",

      "\"British artists have perhaps enjoyed stronger years overall,\" she told the BBC, \"but plenty of UK talent ranging from Charli XCX, Dua Lipa, and Coldplay to The Last Dinner Party, Beabadoobee, and rising star Myles Smith, have had brilliant years.",
      "\"We shouldn't forget that music is cyclical or that some of our major artists have not been active and can be expected to return in 2025 with new material.",
      "\"So I think we can be optimistic and look upon it as a 'blip' for now, but without becoming complacent.\"",
      "The BPI also noted that emerging music superpowers in Latin America and South Korea often receive government backing, and urged the UK to protect and support its own music industry.",
      "In particular, it raised concerns over proposed changes to the UK's copyright law, which it claimed \"would allow international tech giants to train AI models on artists' work without payment or permission\".",
      "\"The UK remains a world music power, but this status cannot be taken for granted,\" said Dr Twist.",

    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",

      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",

      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:46:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Willem Dafoe reflects on the appeal of Dracula: \"It's interesting to have the undead visit the living\".",
    "story": [
      "When I meet Willem Dafoe on Zoom to discuss his latest movie Nosferatu, we get on to mortality fast.",
      "The four-time Oscar-nominated actor is talking to me for Radio 4's Today programme about Robert Eggers' remake of the 1922 silent film of the same name, which was an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",
      "Nosferatu is the tale of a terrifying vampire who is infatuated with a haunted young woman called Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.",
      "The story that unfolds involves a lot of death. Where creatures that feed on human blood are concerned, that's pretty standard. But Dafoe, who plays a vampire-hunting professor of the occult in the film, tells me in real life too \"we're all somewhere considering death all the time\".",
      "For him, that's one explanation for the popularity of vampire stories.",
      "Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has been adapted numerous times, and vampires in general are never far from our screens.",
      "Dafoe rationalises the enduring appeal of the subgenre like this: \"It's a very interesting proposition to have the undead visit the living, and it becomes something of a meditation of the dark side of things versus the light\".",
      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",
      "It's perfect for Dafoe, who tells me he doesn't like to work too much with computer-generated imagery (the green screen and other visual effects that have become integral to filmmaking).",
      "\"You need to earn the authority to pretend, and through the technology, that gets lost\".",
      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",
      "He pointed to \"the shadow side\" of these occasions, \"a time when some people fall into depression because they fall out of that happiness\".",
      "It's true that his film work offers up both sides - the joy and the pain of life, the extremes of being human and everything in-between.",
      "He tells me that if you don't recognise there is a shadow side to life, \"you're going to become a victim of it some day\".",
      "As I look at him on the computer screen, it's impossible not to reflect on how expressive his face is - a face that could be carved from the earth.",
      "He tells me he only realised it when he started being photographed on the red carpet.",
      "\"Man, they get some ugly pictures of me. They get some grotesque pictures and they get some nice pictures\".",
      "He puts that down to his face having \"range\".",
      "\"I never think about my face,\" he goes on. \"If I ever do, it's really just to tell it to calm down\".",
      "Nosferatu is released in the UK on 1 January 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Johnnie Walker's long radio career was shaped by his early years as a pirate broadcaster in the 1960s, bobbing around on the ocean on Radio Caroline.",
      "Even 50 years later, his wife Tiggy would refer to him as \"the pirate\".",
      "It remained more than apt, given that his subsequent time on mainstream radio was marked by more than a few battles with the bosses.",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Rebel spirit",
      "His DJ career began at the age of 21, when he was first given a chance to play records on 'Swinging' Radio England, a boat moored four miles off the Essex coast.",
      "In return, they asked that he change his name - from Peter Dingley to the rather more rock 'n' roll-sounding Johnnie Walker.",
      "The boat was one of a number of floating stations that had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that allowed them to get round the BBC's monopoly on the UK airwaves to bring the sound of 60s pop to the nation's radios - something the BBC had up to that point largely resisted.",
      "Walker took to the rebel spirit. His years at public school had fostered a loathing of authority, and he had gone out of his way to fail his O-levels. Radio allowed him to embrace his passion - music - especially the rock, soul and underground sounds that were not making it to the top of the singles chart.",
      "Occasionally, he would row across to another boat, Radio London, to chat to a kindred spirit, a young DJ who was beginning to make a name for himself, John Peel.",
      "It wasn't tea he was talking about",
      "Walker then moved to the pirate mothership, Radio Caroline.",
      "His style was laid back, conversational and a contrast to the highly formatted slick patter of many other DJs.",
      "That attitude may have had something to do with his favoured means of relaxation on board. He even had an on-air code - he said the boat was running short of tea to signal that they were running out of his preferred type of herbal cigarette.",
      "His time on board also coincided with the government\u2019s decision to crack down on the pirates. Walker was on air at midnight of 14 August 1967, when the law making the pirates illegal came in to force.",
      "He read out a defiant speech declaring: \"We belong to you and we love you.\" His reputation as a symbol of the spirit of the pirates was assured.",
      "Undone by the Bay City Rollers",
      "However, in 1969 he switched sides and joined the establishment, BBC Radio One. It was not the easiest of relationships.",
      "He was, he said, accused of being \"too into the music\". He would pepper his shows with album tracks and songs outside the approved playlist.",
      "When he championed Walk on the Wild Side, Lou Reed\u2019s song about sex, drugs and transgender bohemia, his BBC boss had questions. It only stayed on the playlist because they had never encountered the phrase \"giving head\".",
      "Walker also loved Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles; Chirpy, Chirpy Cheep, Cheep, not so much.",

      "Payne died on 16 October after falling from a hotel balcony in the capital, Buenos Aires.",
      "Here's what we know so far about the police investigation and the circumstances surrounding Payne's death.",
      "Why was Liam in Argentina?",
      "Payne was visiting his former bandmate Niall Horan, who was in the country on tour.",
      "He posted on Snapchat earlier in October that he was visiting Horan for a catch-up, saying: \"It's been a while since me and Niall have spoken, we've got a lot to talk about.\" He added: \"No bad vibes or anything like that, but we need to talk.\"",

      "His final Snapchats from last few days in Argentina",
      "Payne attended Horan's show, posting social media videos of himself and girlfriend Kate Cassidy singing and dancing at the concert.",
      "He documented much of his trip on Snapchat, including pictures of food, plans to play polo, and jokes about his hair. We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "Payne's friend Roger Nores was at the hotel with him but left at 16:11 local time (20:11 BST) on 16 October, Argentine prosecutors have said.",
      "Payne was then in the hotel lobby and was unable to stand \"due to the consumption of various substances\", they said.",
      "At 16:54, cameras recorded him being dragged unconscious by three people - led by chief receptionist Esteban Grassi - and taken to his room, according to prosecutors.",
      "Grassi called emergency services at about 17:00, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",
      "\"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" Grassi said in a second call.",

      "Read the full transcript of the hotel's emergency call",
      "Payne's room was on the third floor and had a balcony about 14m (45ft) above an interior courtyard.",
      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "Police say they found his room in \"total disorder\". Local media later published pictures purportedly from his room, showing a TV with a broken screen, multiple bottles, cans, candles, aluminium foil and a half-full glass of champagne.",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "However, following a further forensic report and an inspection of the scene on 5 December, a judge said that, in his state of intoxication, Payne \"tried to leave the room through the balcony\" and fell to his death.",
      "The judge concluded that Payne tried to leave from the balcony because forensic experts had decided he did not pass out and lose his balance.",

      "Even if you were lucky enough to get a new console or games this Christmas, you've probably got your eye on some upcoming releases.",
      "And 2025 is shaping up to be a big one.",
      "Most agree that 2024 was a painful year for the games industry, with tens of thousands of layoffs and worldwide studio closures.",
      "There's a hope that things will bounce back - at least in part - next year.",
      "And two huge releases in particular are likely to cut through in a big way.",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6",
      "A cultural moment, a day millions of gamers have been awaiting for a very, very long time.",
      "The release of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).",
      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",
      "A new Nintendo Switch?",
      "Here's what we know, officially, about Nintendo's next console.",
      "It exists.",
      "Your current Switch games will work on it.",
      "And that's it.",
      "There's no official name yet, but fans have been calling it the Nintendo Switch 2.",
      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",
      "\"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"I think they've learned a lot of lessons since then.\"",
      "More breakout hits",
      "Some of 2024's biggest success stories came from small, independent developers.",
      "The most notable was Balatro - an addictive, poker-inspired card game that ended the year in the running for high-profile game of the year awards.",
      "Journalist Rachel Watts, who hosts the Indieventure podcast, feels that has helped to set the stage for more breakout success this year.",
      "\"There's been so many great indies this year,\" she says.",
      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",
      "\"If Balatro can knock elbows with some of the biggest titles of the year, then I'm hoping other other indies will.\"",
      "esports Olympics",
      "There's another big moment to watch in 2025: the first Olympic Esports Games will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it's an important moment because the Olympic movement has traditionally not been too keen on esports,\" says George.",
      "After years of campaigning the International Olympics Committee agreed a 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia to host the gaming version.",
      "The first esports World Cup took place in the kingdom this summer, and George says the event \"didn't really cut through\" to a wider audience.",

      "Some fans, players and commentators boycotted the World Cup in protest over Saudi Arabia's human rights records.",
      "George says the esports Olympics will revive conversations about sportswashing - the idea that Saudi Arabia uses its vast wealth to invest in sports and entertainment to improve its international reputation - something it's denied.",
      "\"You have this really interesting thing,\" says George.",
      "\"Your big esports moment - esports becomes an Olympic sport.",

    "summary": "The wild success of K-entertainment - from pop hits to mushy dramas - has been in the making for years.",
    "story": [
      "Evan Barringer was 14 years old when he stumbled onto Full House, a South Korea romcom where two strangers are forced to share a house.",
      "Sitting in his house in Memphis, he hit play assuming it was an Asian remake of a beloved American sitcom from the 1980s. It wasn\u2019t until the third episode that he realised they had nothing in common save the name. But he was hooked.",
      "That accidental choice changed his life. Twelve years on, he is an English teacher in South Korea - and he says he loves it here: \u201cI have got to try all the foods I\u2019ve seen in K-dramas, and I\u2019ve gotten to see several of the K-pop artists in concerts whose lyrics I used to study Korean.\u201d",
      "When Evan discovered Full House in 2012, South Korean entertainment was a blip in the world\u2019s eye. Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style was the best-known Korean pop export at the time.",
      "Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that\u2019s four times the population of South Korea. Squid Game, Netflix's most popular show ever, has just returned for a much-anticipated second season.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The so-called Korean Wave swept the world, experts say, when the success of streaming met American-inspired production value. And Korean entertainment \u2013 from pop music and mushy dramas to acclaimed hits built around universal themes \u2013 was ready for it.",

      "\u2018I lost nine teeth filming Squid Game\u2019: BBC on set with show\u2019s director",
      "BTS and Blackpink are now familiar names on the global pop circuit. People are swooning over sappy K-dramas from Dubai to India to Singapore. Overseas sales of all this Korean content - including video games - is now worth billions.",
      "Last month, after 53-year-old poet and novelist Han Kang won the Nobel Prize for her literature, online boards were full of memes noting South Korea\u2019s \u201cCulture Victory\u201d \u2014 a reference to the popular video game series Civilisation.",
      "And there were jokes about how the country had achieved the dream of founding father Kim Koo, who famously wrote that he wished for Korea to be a nation of culture rather than might.",
      "As it turns out, this moment had been in the making for years.",
      "It's all in the timing",
      "After South Korea\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1987, censorship was loosened and numerous TV channels launched. Soon, there was a generation of creators who had grown up idolising Hollywood and hip-hop, says Hye Seung Chung, associate professor of Korean Film Studies at the University of Buffalo.",
      "Around the same time, South Korea rapidly grew rich, benefitting from an export boom in cars and electronics. And money from conglomerates, or chaebols as they are known, flowed into film and TV production, giving it a Hollywood-like sheen.",
      "They came to own much of the industry, from production to cinemas. So they were willing to splurge on making movies without worrying much about losses, Prof Chung says.",
      "K-pop, meanwhile, had become a domestic rage in the mid-90s, propelling the success of groups such as HOT and Shinhwa.",
      "This inspired agencies to replicate the gruelling Japanese artist management system.",
      "Scout young talent, often in their teens, and sign them onto years-long contracts through which they become \u201cperfect\u201d idols, with squeaky clean images and hyper-managed public personas. As the system took hold, it transformed K-pop, creating more and more idols.",
      "By the 2000s, Korean TV shows and K-pop were a hit in East and South East Asia. But it was streaming that took them to the world, and into the lives of anyone with a smartphone.",
      "That\u2019s when the recommendation engine took over \u2013 it has been key in initiating Korean culture fans, taking them from one show to the next, spanning different genres and even platforms.",
      "The alien and the familiar",
      "Evan says he binged the 16 hour-long episodes of Full House. He loved the way it took its time to build the romance, from bickering banter to attraction, unlike the American shows he knew.",
      "\u201cI was fascinated by each cultural difference I saw - I noticed that they don\u2019t wear shoes in the house,\u201d he recalls. So he took up Netflix\u2019s suggestions for more Korean romcoms. Soon, he found himself humming to the soundtracks of the shows, and was drawn to K-pop.",
      "He has now begun watching variety shows, a reality TV genre where comedians go through a series of challenges together.",
      "As they work their way through the recommendations, fans are immersed in a world that feels foreign yet familiar \u2013 one that eventually includes kimchi jiggae, a spicy kimchi stew, and kalguksu, a seafood and kelp noodle broth.",
      "When Mary Gedda first visited South Korea, she went looking for a bowl of kimchi jjigae, as she had seen the stars do on screen numerous times.",
      "\u201cI was crying [as I ate it]. It was so spicy,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, why did I order this? They eat it so easily in every show.\u201d",
      "Mary, an aspiring French actor, now lives in Seoul. Originally a K-pop fan, she then discovered K-dramas and learned Korean. She has starred in a few cameo roles as well. \u201cI got lucky and I absolutely love it,\u201d she says.",
      "For Mary, food was a big part of the appeal because she saw such a variety of it on K-dramas. Seeing how characters build relationships over food was familiar to her, she says, because she grew up in the French countryside in Burgundy.",
      "But there is also the promise of romance, which drew Marie Namur to South Korea from her native Belgium. She began watching K-dramas on a whim, after visiting South Korea, but she says she kept going because she was \u201cpretty much attracted to all those beautiful Korean men\u201d.",
      "\"[They] are impossible love stories between a super-rich guy and a girl who is usually poor, and, you know, the guy is there to save her and it really sells you a dream.\"",
      "But it is Korean women who are writing most of these shows \u2013 so it is their imagination, or fantasy, that is capturing the interest (and hearts) of other women across the world.",
      "In Seoul, Marie said she was \u201ctreated like a lady\u201d, which hadn\u2019t happened \u201cin a very long time\u201d, but her \u201cdating experience is not exactly as I expected it to be\u201d.",
      "\u201cI do not want to be a housewife. I want to keep working. I want to be free. I want to go clubbing with my girlfriends if I want to, even though I'm married or in a relationship, and a lot of guys here do not want that.\u201d",
      "International fans are often looking for an alternative world because of disappointment with their own society, Prof Chung says.",
      "The prim romances, with handsome, caring and chivalrous heroes, are drawing a female audience turning away from what they see as hypersexual American entertainment. And when social inequality became a stronger theme in Korean films and shows - such as Parasite and Squid Game \u2013 it attracted global viewers disillusioned with capitalism and a yawning wealth divide in their countries.",
      "The pursuit of a global audience has brought challenges as well. The increasing use of English lyrics in K-pop has led to some criticism.",
      "And there is now a bigger spotlight on the industry's less glamorous side. The immense pressure stars face to be perfect, for instance, and the demands of a hyper-competitive industry. Creators behind blockbuster shows have alleged exploitation and complained about not being fairly compensated.",
      "Still, it\u2019s great to see the world pay attention to Korea, Prof Chung says. She grew up in a repressive South Korea, when critics of the government were regularly threatened or even killed. She escaped into American movies.",
      "When Parasite played in the cinema of the small American town where she lives, she saw on the faces of other moviegoers the same awe she felt as a child watching Hollywood films: \u201cIt feels so great that our love is returned.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Dame Laura, 32, gave her body to cycling for more than a decade. She is Britain's most successful female athlete.",
      "\"Every training session I went in there to give 100%, every race I went in there to give 100%.",
      "\"I took it to the limit - if I wasn't sick after a race I'd be like, 'Did I try hard enough?'\"",
      "That absolute commitment was rewarded in the velodrome. Two golds at the London 2012 Olympics were followed by two more at Rio 2016.",
      "She married fellow cycling phenomenon Jason Kenny later that year and the couple welcomed their first baby, Albie, in 2017. She then secured another gold and silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021).",
      "But she miscarried in November 2021 and five months later had an ectopic pregnancy, in which the embryo implants outside of the womb, requiring emergency surgery.",
      "\"Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "She had never really worried about her own fertility before. Conceiving Albie had been straightforward, and that pregnancy went smoothly. And thankfully, she would successfully give birth to another son, Monty, in July 2023.",
      "But - as Dame Laura began to talk publicly about her baby losses - other athletes told her they had been through the same thing.",
      "It has left a nagging question - could elite sport have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes?",
      "\"Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'\" she says.",
      "Miscarriage is common. The NHS says one-in-eight known pregnancies end before 24 weeks and many occur at a very early stage. Most couples never find out why.",
      "But are athletes at greater risk of any type of fertility problem?",
      "Dr Emma O'Donnell, an exercise physiologist at Loughborough University, says the lifestyle of a professional athlete puts a unique strain on the human body.",
      "Elite training burns a phenomenal number of calories and, as a result, athletes' bodies are often lean and muscular, containing very little body fat.",
      "If they don't eat enough food to keep up with the calorie burn then issues with menstrual cycles, such as periods stopping for months or even years, are \"very common\", Dr O'Donnell says.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of female athletes experience interrupted periods, particularly in endurance sports. There are comparably high rates of periods disappearing in competitors in sports like gymnastics, ballet and figure skating. This compares to only 2-5% of the general population.",
      "Absent periods can be a sign that ovulation (or egg release) isn't happening.",
      "How does that happen in the body?",
      "\"We're not 100% sure,\" says Dr O'Donnell, but the leading idea is that having a baby is so energy-intensive that the brain shuts off reproduction if it thinks there is insufficient spare energy.",
      "It starts in the hypothalamus, a small structure in the centre of the brain that senses the nutritional state of the body.",
      "Sitting just underneath the hypothalamus is the body's hormone factory - the pituitary gland.",
      "Normally, the gland releases hormones that travel down to the womb and ovaries to control the monthly menstrual cycle and the release of an egg, which makes pregnancy possible.",
      "But if the hypothalamus isn't happy, this process breaks down and ovulation doesn't happen.",
      "\"If you're not ovulating you can't have a baby. You can't conceive because there's no egg being released,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "The biggest factor in this seems to be the huge number of calories burned while training, which can leave athletes struggling to eat enough food to compensate.",
      "This phenomenon is known as relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), and was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014.",
      "But other factors are also likely to be involved, says Prof Geeta Nargund, a consultant at St George's Hospital and medical director of Create Fertility.",
      "Fat in the body helps make the sex hormone oestrogen.",
      "\"If the sport is affecting body fat content, then quite clearly there's an effect on oestrogen levels,\" she says.",
      "Psychological stress \u2013 potentially from the pressures of training and competing \u2013 can also disrupt the menstrual cycle.",
      "\"We do see this in women with high levels of anxiety,\" said Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Disruption to periods and egg release is the most clearly recognised impact on a female athlete's fertility, but this should resolve once they retire from competition, she notes.",
      "Ectopic and miscarriage",
      "For those who do manage to conceive, things can still go wrong. After an egg is fertilised, it should implant into the lining of the womb. However, in an ectopic pregnancy the egg implants elsewhere, usually in the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb.",
      "Around 11,000 pregnancies a year in the UK are ectopic. It's not completely clear why they happen, although inflammation and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can increase the risk.",
      "\"But in this case, I don't see a direct link between sports and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy,\" said Prof Nargund, who has treated athletes struggling with their fertility.",
      "However, she said there was a potential link between too much intense exercise in the first three months of pregnancy and miscarriage \u2013 although far more research is needed to be certain.",
      "She pointed to a large Danish study that followed more than 90,000 women and suggested the more intense exercise women did, the higher the risk. This was particularly for weight-bearing and high-impact exercises.",
      "\"If you end up in the Laura Kenny territory where you're an elite athlete, you're the very top of that,\" Prof Nargund said.",
      "But she explained the findings needed to be taken \"with caution\" because the way the study was designed meant there could be other explanations that had not been considered.",
      "Meanwhile, a very small study of 34 Norwegian athletes found no increased risk of fertility problems, including miscarriage.",
      "\"We need to do a lot more research when it comes to sports, exercise, hormone balance and reproduction,\" says Prof Nargund.",
      "Athletes freezing their eggs",
      "Lauren Nicholls played elite level netball for 10 years then had two children, before becoming coach of Super League champions Loughborough Lightning. She says the conversations current players have about fertility are different to the ones she had with her teammates.",
      "\"I know a few of the slightly older players - they've frozen eggs and made those decisions for their family for a later date,\" she says. \"Because they're worried about their career.\"",
      "Juggling being an elite athlete and starting a family has always been a tricky challenge. For women, their years of peak fertility overlap with the time they hit their physical peak.",
      "Male athletes are also not immune to fertility issues. Burning more energy than you have coming in may affect testosterone levels, cause sperm abnormalities and even erectile dysfunction.",
      "But for Dr Emma Pullen, a sports exercise researcher at Loughborough, the lack of definitive answers on the impact of elite sport is emblematic of how poorly female athletes have been researched, from fertility to injury risk.",
      "She said research was \"playing catch up\" with the amount of attention on male sport.",
      "\"We're seeing the repercussions of that with growing professionalisation of women's sports and more female athletes than ever before,\" Dr Pullen adds.",
      "Overall, Prof Nargund argues female athletes are likely to face more fertility challenges than other women.",
      "\"There seems to be a fertility problem because of [elite sport's] potential effect on ovulation, including potentially a higher risk of miscarriage,\" she says.",
      "But a definitive answer on exactly how much elite-level exercise is too much is not clear. And that's enough for Dame Laura, for now.",
      "\"The conversation in itself I feel is really important because I want people to start talking,\" Laura says. \"Honestly, I would love it if it was a lot more open.\"",
      "The relationship between exercise and fertility affects all of us though, even if we're a long way from Olympic glory.",
      "How does exercise affect everyone else's fertility?",
      "Most men and women benefit from exercising and losing excess weight before trying to conceive \u2013 this is known to boost fertility.",
      "Regular physical activity reduces stress, improves sleep and makes periods more regular in those with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",
      "But amateur female athletes who train intensively can also end up running on empty and seeing their periods stop, or become irregular.",
      "\"Not to quite the same extent, but it's there,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Making sure there's a balance between energy intake and energy output is \"really important to ovulatory cycles\" and the key to maintaining reproductive function, she adds.",
      "\"[Amateur athletes] are not aware of the fact of how many calories they really need to put in to meet that energy demand.\""

    "summary": "The message comes after the Welsh Ambulance Service declared a critical incident on Monday evening.",
    "story": [
      "Welsh ambulance service chiefs have urged the public to \"drink sensibly\" at new year to help reduce demand on emergency services that suffered a 340-call backlog on Monday.",
      "Jason Killens, chief executive of Welsh Ambulance Service, made the plea after the service declared a critical incident.",
      "In addition, more than half of the trust's ambulance vehicles were waiting to hand over patients outside hospitals.",
      "Mr Killens asked the public to use the service \"wisely\" and only call during a \"genuine emergency\", and said it was prepared for the additional pressure and 999 calls.",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Killens said there were delays at urgent and emergency care departments which prevented ambulance staff handing over patients.",
      "He said that one of the reasons for the pressure on the health system was down to winter viruses such as flu and Covid along with other factors.",
      "\"The pressure across the urgent and emergency care in the NHS is well documented. It's a challenge here in Wales as it is in the rest of the UK,\" he said.",
      "Mr Killens said other factors had also contributed to the pressures placed on the system.",
      "\"It's caused by many factors some associated with patients that are medically fit for discharge being unable to get back in to the communities because of the pressure in adult social care,\" he said.",
      "However, he added that while the pressure had continued overnight, the number of ambulances waiting was slightly less.",
      "\"As we go through this morning and we see the numbers of calls coming into us rising throughout the day as we normally would, we will see that similar situation of pressure arise today,\" he said.",
      "He apologised to patients waiting \"far too long\" but said there were plans in place to manage the backlog of calls.",
      "\"We do have doctors, nurses and paramedics providing advice over the phone and managing less serious patients in a different way so we can respond to those much more sick patients as quickly as we can,\" he said.",
      "Mr Killens also thanked the staff and volunteers for their work during the critical incident.",
      "On Monday, the Welsh Ambulance Service described the situation as \"very rare\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Killens explained that declaring a critical incident \"signals the the rest of the NHS that we've got a problem, we are under extreme pressure and we need help\".",
      "South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it would support the ambulance service, urging people to call 999 \"for serious emergencies and where life is at risk\".",
      "\"With the pressure on the NHS and the yellow weather warning for Wales over the coming days, we expect demand for emergency services to be high,\" said Christian Hadfield, assistant chief fire officer.",
      "Health boards in Wales have reiterated the ambulance service's message only to call 999 or go to hospital with life-threatening symptoms or in an emergency.",
      "A spokesperson for Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said its hospitals were extremely busy.",
      "They said: \"None of us wants to start 2025 in a busy emergency department or in the back of an ambulance so please take care as you celebrate the new year and think carefully about whether your health need is an emergency.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Hywel Dda University Health Board said its hospital sites, especially emergency departments, were under \"extreme pressure\".",
      "A spokesperson for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said it was experiencing operational pressures following the Christmas break.",
      "\"The increase in flu both in the community and across our hospital sites has resulted in several ward closures with 100 beds currently closed of which 10 are empty - we expect this to increase over the next few days,\" they said.",
      "A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said its services were facing the same extreme pressures being reported across Wales and the UK.",
      "\"We are currently operating at a level 4 escalation status, with the demands prevalent across our entire system and unfortunately causing long waits for our services and impacting the flow of patients through our hospitals.\"",
      "'Enough is enough'",
      "Dr Rowena Christmas, chair of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said the situation was worrying and had been for several years.",
      "She said: \"The amount of acute respiratory illnesses we are seeing at the moment is extraordinary.\"",
      "Marie Curie Cymru's Jon Antoniazzi called the critical incident \"deeply troubling.\"",
      "\"While winter pressures are a constant challenge, on behalf of all people with a terminal illness and their families in Wales, we must draw a line under this and say enough is enough,\" he said.",
      "A critical incident was also declared in December 2020, due to high demand, particularly in south east Wales.",
      "But an extraordinary incident was declared in 2023 after an ambulance spent more than 28 hours outside a hospital.",
      "The Welsh government said urgent and emergency care services across Wales continued to see high levels of demand this winter.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We are urging people to only call 999 in the event of a life-threatening emergency and to carefully consider where to go for care. For urgent care needs, NHS 111 Wales can be accessed 24/7 online or telephone service for advice and signposting.",
      "\"Increase in flu cases has further added pressure during the Christmas period and resulted in action being taken by health boards including prevention and control measures.\"",

    "summary": "James Hunt says he will never regret becoming a full-time carer to his two autistic sons.",
    "story": [
      "James Hunt used to spend his days commuting to London, where he ran a successful marketing firm.",
      "But his children Jude and Tommy were diagnosed as autistic when they were toddlers, and he later decided to care for them and his parents full-time.",
      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",
      "It's somewhere for people in the community to visit, we have a sensory room in the shop and we get lots of parents coming in who want to have a chat.",
      "Everyone working in the shop is a parent, carer or is autistic, so they can share their experiences with customers.",
      "'I've learned to cherish the simple things'",
      "I always try to focus on the positives and not think too far ahead but there are days when my mind runs away with me.",
      "It will be a huge challenge when the boys leave school when they are 19.",
      "That's massively scary because suddenly you have to trust a whole new bunch of people.",
      "There is a part-time college I hope they can go to but it's a huge unknown and there will be big decisions to make.",
      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",
      "It has taught me to cherish and enjoy the simple things and I just want the boys to be happy.",
      "Looking back at how I felt when they were diagnosed, I would like to tell myself it's all going to be OK.",
      "Those first few years can be a really scary and emotional time. You feel like you have no idea what you're doing.",
      "Don't bottle everything up, find people to open up to. Your friends and family want to help, they just don't know how to yet.",
      "You will go through the most challenging and difficult days of your life but you will learn so much from your boys and your love for them will get you through.",

      "In October, business coach Rebecca Amin opened her laptop to join a video call as her children played in the room next door. When her male client turned on his camera Rebecca was shocked to find he was standing naked from the waist down.",
      "\"It was disgusting,\" she says, \"I felt violated.\"",
      "Rebecca decided to report the offence to the local police, believing what had happened on screen at her home in Surrey, was no less serious a matter than if it had taken place in person.",
      "But she was disappointed by the police's reaction. It transpired the man - who had contacted Rebecca to request career coaching - was calling from India, and police told her that they would keep details of the incident on file, but there was little they could do.",
      "Rebecca is one of a number of victims of obscene calls and indecent exposure by strangers, who have told BBC News that police are failing to carry out proper investigations and dismissing their experiences.",
      "The women contacted the BBC following a report highlighting failures by two forces when dealing with reports of malicious, sexualised phone calls.",
      "Some victims of \"non-contact sexual offences\" - crimes that do not involve physical contact between perpetrator and victim - say they, like Rebecca, have been left feeling violated.",
      "The minister for safeguarding, Jess Phillips, has told the BBC any suggestion police and prosecutors are not taking these offences seriously is \"not tolerable\".",
      "Police chiefs say not all victims receive the right outcomes when their cases are investigated and admit some forces have fallen short.",
      "A sexually obscene phone call - and my two-year ordeal getting police to act",
      "Rebecca posted about what had happened to her on the social media platform LinkedIn and was surprised when five women, also business coaches, reached out to say they had experienced the same thing with a man using the same profile.",
      "She also contacted the platform that hosted her video calls. They told her they could provide an IP address for the man which would identify his device and provide information about his geolocation, if the police requested that information from them.",
      "But despite providing police with the names and contact details for the other victims and a contact at the video-hosting platform, Rebecca didn't hear from them again.",
      "\"It felt like they'd washed their hands of it,\" Rebecca says. \"It made me feel that it's not something they could be bothered to follow up, or it's not important enough.\"",
      "But she was fearful this offence could have been a prelude to something much more serious.",
      "\"I said to the police, 'My concern isn't just what he's doing through a screen to me and to other women, but what he's doing locally - when this isn't enough for him anymore - to somebody he has physical access to.'\"",
      "Surrey Police only got in touch with Rebecca again after BBC News approached them for a response.",
      "In a statement, the force said it had provided Rebecca with an apology and an update, but said delays investigating her case fall \"far short\" of what she should rightly expect.",
      "\"We aim to approach every investigation with care and service,\" they said, \"and we completely accept that we did not deliver that in this case.\"",
      "Surrey Police says Rebecca's case is now being investigated further.",
      "'Police don't look at the risk posed by the offender'",
      "In 2020, 83-year-old Barbara Marsden told her daughter, Sally, that a workman who had visited her home in Lancashire had indecently exposed himself to her.",
      "Sally says her mother described how the man allegedly showed her his penis.",
      "CCTV outside Barbara's house showed the workman undoing and then doing up the zip on his trousers.",
      "Sally, who is a lawyer, reported the incident to police, but while the officer assigned to the case was helpful and proactive, she believes the system let her mother down.",
      "\"It was very frustrating,\" Sally says. \"It felt like I was driving the case.\"",
      "By the time police decided to carry out a video interview with her mother - four months later - Barbara, who has dementia, was unable to recall the details of what had happened.",
      "Sally says she also had to carry out research to find an address for the suspect, and convince prosecutors why they should not drop the case.",
      "It took more than three years for the case to come to trial, leaving Sally concerned the man's crimes might have escalated.",
      "\"He targeted a vulnerable elderly person in her own home... Was he going to do something worse?",
      "\"I don't think there's a recognition of the fact that people who flash are actually more likely to do more serious things,\" Sally says. \"The police don't look at the risk that's posed by the offender.\"",
      "In a statement, Lancashire Police told the BBC they had received a report of an indecent exposure in 2020 and launched an investigation. A man was arrested and charged, they said, but was subsequently acquitted after a trial.",
      "A review found the service delivered was acceptable, they added.",
      "The man accused of indecently exposing himself to Sally's elderly mother was later convicted in a separate case of making indecent images of a child.",
      "'He was making disgusting noises'",
      "Dame Vera Baird, former victims' commissioner, told the BBC that violence against women and girls needed to be a higher priority for police.",
      "Speaking to BBC R4's Today programme, she said: \"There is reinforcement to get rid of the dated notion that this is some kind of weird antisocial behaviour and a nuisance and just to look away.\"",
      "Dame Vera reiterated the pervasive nature of \"non-contact sexual offences,\" saying that while it may be online, it still occurs \"right in your own home.\" She added: \"You wonder if he knows you or where you live. In the street, it's the same thing; it's in one's mind.\"",
      "Lara Burns was on holiday in Spain with her family in October 2021 when she received an anonymous phone call. The man at the other end of the line called Lara by her name and then made obscene sexual noises and comments.",
      "It wasn't the first time she had received a call like this. A few months previously there had been a similar call. She had dismissed it then - but this time she couldn't.",
      "\"I definitely got the same bloke,\" Lara says. \"It was in the middle of the daytime - making disgusting noises and talking about disgusting things.\"",
      "Lara, who is from Stevenage and has a teenage daughter, says she felt threatened and feared the man might also have her address, so she reported the calls to Hertfordshire Police.",
      "\"I started to think, 'Is it someone who might know me from work? Is it someone who has just found me online?'\"",
      "Lara was interviewed by a police constable, had a more detailed conversation with another officer, and was then referred to Victim Support.",
      "\"I remember feeling quite violated,\" says Lara.",
      "She no longer felt safe going out at night and was sent a rape alarm by Victim Support.",
      "But she says she never heard anything more from Hertfordshire Police.",
      "Lara says the incident had a lasting adverse effect on her and believes the police could have done more to investigate.",
      "Hertfordshire Police told the BBC they were unable to trace the origin of the calls and had tried to contact Lara several times without success, before writing to her to let her know they wouldn't be able to \"progress the investigation further\".",
      "The force said it had \"followed all proportionate lines of enquiry for offences of this nature\".",
      "If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",
      "Jess Phillips says she is sorry some victims are having poor experiences.",
      "\"To suggest that non-contact sexual crimes are not serious is not tolerable,\" she says. She acknowledges police resourcing is an issue, adding: \"Violence against women and girls is a strategic policing priority - it is not an optional extra.\"",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council says it is working to improve the way these types of offences are investigated and prosecuted.",
      "\"We know there are cases where the police response has fallen short and the outcomes for the victims have not been good enough.\"",

      "Among Sir Keir's ministers, I pick up two recurring sentiments about the party's first six months in power.",
      "The first - and you can still see it in the eyes of ministers when they reflect upon their work - is an excitement after years in the wilderness of opposition that they now have power, and are called upon to make decisions every day.",
      "But the second is a frustration at too many mistakes.",

      "A group of MPs says compensation is not being paid quickly enough for the victims of the Post Office scandal and is calling for the government to face financial penalties if the process doesn't speed up.",
      "The Business and Trade Select Committee said binding timeframes were needed, with any money arising from missed deadlines going to the claimants if they weren't met.",
      "The committee also called for the Post Office to be removed from its role in the compensation schemes, and asked for more transparency over how much it was paying for lawyers.",
      "The government said it was \"working tirelessly\" to settle claims \"at a faster rate than ever before\".",
      "Committee chairman Liam Byrne MP said: \"The fault lies with the Post Office, but ultimately government is the shareholder in the Post Office and acts on our behalf\".",
      "The government is already looking at the Post Office's role in the compensation schemes.",

      "It found the application process was akin to a second trial for the victims, adding that lawyers administering the schemes were making millions whilst the vast majority of the money set aside for redress had still to be paid out.",
      "The committee's recommendations include providing upfront legal advice for victims and hard deadlines for administrators to approve claims - with financial penalties if they take too long.",
      "Only around \u00a3499m of the budgeted \u00a31.8bn has been paid out so far, to more than 3,000 claimants. The committee said that meant 72% of the budget had still not paid.",
      "Many of those with the most complicated claims have still to be fully settled.",

    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",

      "Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of A8 nationals, mostly Polish, moved to the UK.",

      "Amin had taken power in a coup six months before, and the brutal nature of his regime wasn't yet clear to Western governments. In 1971 he was invited to Buckingham Palace, as well as Downing Street.",
      "Just a year later, Amin expelled tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, giving them only 90 days to leave the country. Many held British passports and came to settle in the UK.",
      "Among the world leaders - including Jimmy Carter, Ferdinand Marcos and Indira Gandhi - is an anomaly, four pages packed with signatures of well-known British women of 1978 - Anna Ford, Cleo Laine, Prue Leith and Janet Street-Porter.",
      "The latter was a well-known face on TV, but Janet Street-Porter remembers being intimidated by the event, a reception to mark 50 years of equal suffrage.",
      "\"I always appeared cocky and self-assured,\" she said, \"but to be invited to Downing Street for something so historically important was quite a formidable experience for me.\"",
      "While there were many receptions in Downing Street, the book was brought out for very few \u2013 including to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Downing Street in 1985.",
      "The Queen and Prince Philip signed, as did six other prime ministers, including the increasingly frail Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton.",
      "The book captures the changing times: President Mikhail Gorbachev signed in April 1989, when he came for a state visit with his wife, Raisa.",
      "Early the following year, the leaders of the newly independent Eastern European countries visited No 10 - including Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who added his trademark little heart.",
      "The book seems to have been rarely used by John Major and Tony Blair, though there is one striking message from early 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks.",

      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the letter \"says all you need to know\" about Sir Keir's government, claiming he has to \"beg his own government to create growth after Labour's damaging Budget\".",
      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",
      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",
      "The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January."

      "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.",
      "Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.",
      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",

      "This result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.",
      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",
      "\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.",
      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",
      "The technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there are a large collection of well preserved human remains.",
      "Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",

      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",

      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",

      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",
      "Life on Mars?",
      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",
      "Until then, however, humans are likely to continue their small steps into the cosmos, on a path long trodden by robotic explorers before them.",

    "summary": "Astronomers are poised to see a star system about 3,000 light years away explode into brightness.",
    "story": [
      "On a cold February night in 1946, a 15-year-old schoolboy made a surprising discovery as he peered out of his bedroom window.",
      "Michael Woodman, a keen amateur astronomer from Newport, had stayed up late waiting for his father to come home when he noticed something strange in the night sky.",
      "\"There was the constellation of Corona Borealis, but in the ring of the Corona, the second star down was bright - very bright,\" he explains.",
      "\"And I thought 'I've never seen anything like that before.'\"",
      "The next morning he wrote to the Astronomer Royal. The now 94-year-old smiles as he recalls the memory, surprised that his teenage self would be so bold.",
      "\"And bless me if the Astronomer Royal didn't reply, with a letter I've still got.\"",
      "Michael Woodman had witnessed a rare celestial event that briefly dazzled the heavens. Not only that, the Astronomer Royal informed him that he was the first person in the country to have seen this.",
      "He'd spotted a star system, about 3,000 light years away, called T Corona Borealis - or T Cor Bor for short - exploding into brightness, becoming visible in the night sky for a few short days.",
      "\"I hit the jackpot,\" he says.",
      "How to look for T Cor Bor",
      "Now a whole new generation of stargazers are scanning the skies again because scientists believe T Cor Bor ignites about every 80 years or so.",
      "On a crystal clear night, in the Dark Skies Reserve of Bannau Brycheiniog, also known as the Brecon Beacons, astronomers are setting up their telescopes.",
      "\"T Cor Bor is dim at the minute  - it's magnitude 10, well below what you can see with the naked eye,\" explains Dr Jenifer Millard from Fifth Star Labs.",
      "To find the area of sky where it should appear, she advises to first locate the plough and follow its handle to Arcturus. To the west of this star is the curved constellation of Corona Borealis, made up of seven stars, and where T Cor Bor will at some point light up.",
      "\"It is only going to be visible to the naked eye for a couple of days,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course, if you've got a small pair of binoculars or a small telescope, you'll be able to see it for a little bit longer because you've got that magnifying tool. But I do think that it is the short stint in the sky that makes it really special.\"",
      "The astronomical phenomenon is caused by the interaction between two stars orbiting each other.",
      "A small white dwarf, which is a dead star, is locked in a cosmic dance with a much larger red giant - a star that's reaching the end of its life.",
      "The compact white dwarf has an immense gravitational pull, so great that it steals material away from its larger neighbour.",
      "\"The gravity on the surface of the white dwarf is a million times the gravity we feel on Earth, so if we stood on it, we would be crushed instantly,\" explains Dr Jane Clark, from the Cardiff Astronomical Society.",
      "Over time, the material it grabs from the other star gets crushed and compressed - until eventually it triggers a nuclear explosion, releasing a huge amount of energy - a process known as going nova.",
      "\"And when that happens, it will shine like the best Christmas tree in town,\" says Dr Clark.",
      "Astronomers think this process happens on repeat, with an outburst from T Cor Bor occurring about every 80 years.",
      "But there aren't many records of this. And there have already been a few false alarms that T Cor Bor was about to appear - followed by a disappointing no show.",
      "But Dr Chris North from Cardiff University says astronomers around the world are poised to catch the light show, which will allow them to study this star in more detail than ever before.",
      "And he's hopeful it could appear soon.",
      "\"It seems that in the past, this has dimmed a little bit before it's actually erupted, and there are signs that maybe, at the moment, it's just dipping a little bit in brightness,\" he says.",
      "\"So maybe that's a hint that it's getting close to its eruption.\"",
      "Michael Woodman certainly wants to see T Cor Bor again.",
      "\"Somebody will get me into a car and drive me out into the wild somewhere so I can have a decent look. That's what we are hoping for,\" he says.",
      "And if he catches another glimpse of the light show, he believes it will put him in a very exclusive club - of just one.",
      "\"Eighty years on, we're all looking at the skies again, not only me, but the whole world apparently,\" he says.",
      "\"If I'm alive, if I see it, I will be the only one who's seen it twice.\"",
      "Then with a big broad smile and a little chuckle, he adds: \"Got to keep breathing!\""

      "\"That's a wonderful dream,\" said Shivon Ozinga, a Burbank resident opposed to additional bike lanes near her neighborhood. She said the city is too vast, sprawling and reliant on cars to change.",
      "\"I can't imagine it happening in that short amount of time given our car culture here.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:09:22 GMT",
    "summary": "A blurring of the distinctions between seasons is also a challenge for insects and their predators.",
    "story": [
      "Storms and flooding have damaged some of the UK's most precious heritage, according to the National Trust - the UK's biggest conservation charity.",
      "It says extreme weather is taking a toll on the estates it manages in England and Wales, with many mature trees brought down and flooding damaging buildings and gardens.",
      "Warm, wet conditions have prevailed this year and that has brought problems too, the Trust says in its annual roundup of how the weather and climate has affected its vast holdings of land and property.",
      "It says increasing \"homogenisation\" is blurring distinctions between the seasons, which can be challenging for many insect species and the predators that depend on them.",
      "In January, Avebury Manor, a Tudor manor house in Wiltshire, flooded for the first time in 300 years after a series of named storms barrelled into the country. It was one of a number of properties that suffered as Storm Henk was followed by Storms Isha and Jocelyn.",
      "Many of the Trust's properties are not designed to endure the extreme winds and rain storms like this bring. Some buildings still have antique drainpipes and guttering -  often an important design feature - which can overflow in heavy rain, sometimes damaging interiors as well as exteriors.",
      "Later-blooming bluebells",
      "April was cool and wet which meant many flowering plants, including bluebells, flowered later than usual - like these fine examples at Walk Wood in Sheffield Park and Garden in East Sussex.",
      "Many domestic gardens will also have seen plants bloom a little late, but once they got going most should have performed well, helped by the plentiful moisture which kept many plants strong.",
      "The erratic spring weather disrupted some wildlife species including the rare Adonis blue butterfly. Charity The Butterfly Conservation says only 333 examples of this dramatic creature were recorded in one area of west Dorset \u2013 a stronghold of the species \u2013 compared to 1,459 in 2023.",
      "Many bee, wasp and moth species also recorded very low numbers.",
      "\"Our unpredictable weather is resulting in confusion for our wildlife and the slow loss of what once were 'predictable' seasons,\" said Keith Jones, the Climate Change Advisor at the National Trust.",
      "The rainy weather helped re-wet peatland ecosystems across the country after two years of very dry weather in 2022 and into 2023. Rare dragonflies were sighted on various bogland ecosystems, including this female Scare Chaser dragonfly at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire.",
      "Many trees benefited too. Young saplings need moisture to build strong root systems, and the wet weather also relieved stress in some older trees which had been suffering during the parched weather.",
      "There was another good news story on the Suffolk coast. Rangers at the Orford Ness National Nature Reserve announced the establishment of the county's first grey seal colony. The seals are believed to have set up home on the secluded beach at Orford Ness because of the low risk of disturbance, and also because thriving colonies up the coast at Blakeney and Horsey Gap have become crowded.",
      "Seal colony thriving 'thanks to secluded site'",
      "Continued warm weather meant autumn came late this year, but it brought an explosion of colour with some spectacular displays ranging from gold through to russet red, like here on the Wallington Estate in Northumberland.",
      "The lack of frost and wet soils meant many trees kept their leaves well into November, a month longer than usual. But autumn displays were brought to an abrupt end in the second half of the month when a cold snap followed by Storm Bert stripped trees of leaves in just a couple of days.",
      "Why are this year's autumn colours so late?",
      "The mild and wet autumn was great for many species of fungi. Gardeners will have noticed that other moisture-loving creatures - including slugs and snails - thrived too. In the picture above, a leopard slug is eating a false deathcap mushroom on the Blickling Estate in Norfolk.",
      "These last few weeks have seen yet more changeable weather with temperatures seesawing from freezing to balmy in a matter of days. These camelias burst into bloom on 20 November at Glendurgan Garden in Cornwall."

    "story": [
      "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023.",
      "This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024.",
      "The Shenzhen firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.",
      "The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars.",
      "BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.",
      "It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.",
      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",
      "Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.",
      "At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.",
      "Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.",
      "Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.",
      "But the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts.",
      "\"If you don't meet expectations, it can be pretty tough out there,\" said Christopher Carey of the Carnegie Investment Council.",
      "Last month, Honda and Nissan confirmed that they were holding merger talks, as the two Japanese firms seek to fight back against competition from the Chinese car industry.",
      "Earlier in the month, the boss of car making giant Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, quit with immediate effect following a boardroom clash.",
      "His abrupt exit from the company - which owns brands including Vauxhall, Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot and Chrysler - came two months after Stellantis issued a profit warning.",
      "Some governments have stepped in to protect domestic companies.",
      "In October, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese-made EVs came into force across the trade bloc.",
      "The US has also imposed a 100% duty on EVs from China and President-elect Donald Trump is expected to impose further tariffs on imports.",
      "BYD has still been expanding its foothold in emerging economies.",
      "But last month, it faced a setback in Brazil - its largest overseas market - with authorities halting the construction of a BYD factory, saying workers lived in conditions comparable to \"slavery\".",
      "BYD said it had cut ties with the construction firm involved and remained committed to a \"full compliance with Brazilian legislation\"."

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:42:58 GMT",
    "summary": "From space junk gel to hologram surgery, the team had lots of intriguing predictions. Which, if any, came true?",
    "story": [
      "In 1995, the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.",
      "The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted: \"By 2025 we can expect big changes.\"",
      "The programme team agreed, suggesting a raft of world-shaking innovations from hologram surgery to space junk gel.",
      "So, with the help of some experts - and the benefit of three decades of hindsight - let's take a look at how much of today's world that Tomorrow's World successfully anticipated.",
      "The 'Cyberspace Riots' of 2005",
      "In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off - a development Tomorrow's World thought would bring future trouble.",
      "They predicted \"business barons\" and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a \"supernet\" which they restricted access to.",
      "That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots.",
      "Verdict - The internet has remained - mostly - open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people.",
      "One thing the programme didn't predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBC's Lazarus Heist podcast.",
      "Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Asteroid mining and space junk gel",
      "The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.",
      "The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer - a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris.",
      "Verdict - Well, there is no super foam gel and the problem of space junk is an acute one. There is also no space mining industry - but that could change.",
      "Futurist Tom Cheesewright is an optimist about mining beyond our planet.",
      "\"The potential riches are unfathomable and the technology is entirely within our grasp,\" he said.",
      "The super surgeons and their robots",
      "Tomorrow's World predicted by 2004, a law would be passed for all UK hospitals to publish a league table of surgeon success rates. The top surgeons would become so popular, and so well paid, it would make no sense for them to travel to patients.",
      "Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using \"spacial gloves\". At the patient's end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.",
      "Verdict - They didn't get it exactly right but robots are helping with surgeries.",
      "A smart speaker with a floating head",
      "The programme featured a man of the future (wearing a fetching VR headset), his wife and a young girl in what appears to be modern-day London.",
      "In one section, the floating head of a woman comes out of a \"smart speaker\" to tell the man it has been a year since his holiday to \"Indo Disney.\" She encourages him to take another holiday via a \"shuttle to Bangalore\" - which would only take 40 minutes.",
      "Verdict - Ultra-fast travel feels as far away as ever, but holograms, smart speakers and VR headsets are becoming ever more prevalent.",
      "Banking using a microchip in your arm",
      "Elsewhere in the programme, we were given a vision of the future of banking.",
      "It featured a woman going to a bank, complaining there were no humans, and then withdrawing 100 \"Euro marks.\" The bank gives her the money after scanning a chip in her arm.",
      "Verdict - Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies - mainly fingerprint and face scanning - are much more widely used.",
      "Memories from the presenters",
      "Gardeners' World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrow's World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multi-storey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.",
      "Reflecting on it now, he told BBC News that his part of the programme was \"utopian\" and \"naive\".",
      "Looking towards the next 30 years, he is pleased the current generation of young people are \"much more sensitive to climate change\" and thinks people will be growing more of their own food by 2055.",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "He added: \"Tomorrow's World was by definition geared towards the way that mankind could change and improve the world, whereas what we have really learnt since then is that mankind has a habit of making things worse, particularly environmentally, and we have to work with nature rather than try modify and control it.\"",
      "Vivienne Parry was another presenter on the prediction show, and fronted a section about medicine.",
      "She fondly remembers filming it - and the rather limited visual effects of the day. \"I had to stay absolutely still. I had a set of glasses on with a little camera attached. They were stuck on my face via a big blob of black sticky stuff.",
      "\"It was this fantastically hot day, and this black stuff started to leak down my face and I couldn't move. Someone from make-up came along with a long cane with cotton wool on the end to get it off.\"",
      "Vivienne has been involved with Genomics England since 2013, and highlights that some of the predictions from the 1995 Tomorrow's World about genomic sequencing have come true, as she works on a research study to help diagnose and treat genetic conditions.",
      "So what could the world look like in 2055?",
      "Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years - the spread of big tech and social media.",
      "By 2055, she thinks many people will be \"cognitively connected\" - a hive mind of humans and technology via servers, which will help in the sharing of ideas.",
      "\"Brainstorming will literally be brainstorming, where you can share ideas by thinking them.\"",
      "Tom Cheesewright thinks two of the most exciting prospects for the next 30 years will be materials science and bioengineering.",
      "In materials, the creation of devices that are even stronger, lighter and thinner could change the world, while bioengineering - married with tight regulation - has the power to transform medicine and tackle \"some of the biggest challenges humanity faces - decarbonisation, clean water, food\".",
      "So what do you think the world will look like in 30 years?",
      "Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrow's World three decades ago.",
      "\"Some of these changes are very exciting, and some are alarming. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will be very different, and probably not what we expect.\"",

    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",

      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",

      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",

      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",

      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",

      "In September, Israeli troops ordered the Al Jazeera office in Ramallah in the West Bank to close for 45 days claiming it was being used to support terrorist activities.",
      "Israeli officials, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, have often accused Al Jazeera of being a mouthpiece for Hamas.",
      "Israel has also accused Al Jazeera staff in Gaza of belonging to the Islamist group.  In July, the Israeli military killed Ismail al-Ghoul, an Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza City, claiming he was a member of Hamas' s armed wing.  Al Jazeera strongly rejects all the allegations.",

The documents purported to show offers of major concessions to Israel.",

      "But it also contains the names of people who were found to be innocent.",

      "In a letter to parliament on 19 December, Culture Minister Eppo Bruins wrote: \"Openness of archives is crucial for facing the effects of [the Netherlands'] difficult shared past and to process it as a society.\"",
      "How much information made available online would be limited given privacy concerns, and those visiting the archive in person will not be allowed to make copies, he said. Bruins has expressed a wish to change the law to allow more information to be disclosed publicly.",

      "Authorities in India have removed hundreds of tonnes of toxic waste from a chemical factory that witnessed one of the world's deadliest gas leaks 40 years ago.",
      "Thousands of people died in the central city of Bhopal in December 1984 after breathing a poisonous gas leaked from the factory.",
      "On Wednesday, around 337 tonnes of toxic waste was taken from the Union Carbide plant to an incinerator facility around 230km (143 miles) away after a court last month set a four-week deadline for it to be disposed of.",
      "Officials say it will take between three and nine months to treat and destroy the waste but activists have raised concerns about potential damage to people's health at the new location.",
      "Since the disaster, the toxic material had been lying in the mothballed factory, polluting groundwater in the surrounding areas.",
      "The toxic waste cleared from the factory this week included five types of hazardous materials - including pesticide residue and \"forever chemicals\" left from its manufacturing process. These chemicals get the name because they retain their toxic properties indefinitely.",
      "Over decades, these chemicals at the abandoned factory site had been slowly seeping into the surrounding environment, creating a persistent health hazard for people who live in nearby areas.",
      "A 2018 study by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research revealed that high concentrations of metals and chemicals have contaminated groundwater across 42 residential areas near the factory.",
      "After decades of inaction, the Madhya Pradesh state High Court on 3 December set a four-week deadline for authorities to dispose of the toxic waste material from the site.",
      "The court said that authorities were \"still in a state of inertia despite 40 years\".",
      "The process of moving the waste began on Sunday when officials started packing it in leak-proof bags. These bags were then loaded onto 12 sealed trucks on Wednesday.",
      "Officials said the waste was transported under tight security.",
      "A police escort, ambulances, fire engines and a quick response team accompanied the convoy of trucks carrying the waste, the Indian Express newspaper reported.",
      "Swatantra Kumar Singh, the head of Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation department, told the PTI news agency that initially, some of the waste would be burnt at the disposal unit in Pithampur and its residue examined for toxic remains.",
      "He said that special arrangements had been made to ensure that fumes from the incinerator or the ash left after do not pollute the air and water.",
      "But activists and people living near the disposal site have been protesting against the move.",
      "They said that a small amount of waste from the Union Carbide factory was destroyed at the plant on a trial basis in 2015, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported.",
      "It ended up polluting the soil, underground water as well as fresh water bodies in the nearby villages, they said.",
      "Mr Singh has denied these claims, saying that incineration of toxic waste would not have \"any adverse impact\" on nearby villages.",
      "But Rachna Dhingra, from the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal, told BBC World Service that the transfer of waste would \"create a slow-motion Bhopal\" in the new location.",
      "She adds that the transported waste is only a tiny percentage of the actual contamination that people in Bhopal are still dealing with.",
      "\"The 1.1 million tonnes of toxic soil and waste still continues to contaminate the groundwater of hundreds and thousands of people [in Bhopal],\" she says, referring to an estimate from a 2010 government study.",
      "Over the years, officials have made several attempts to dispose of the waste from the  Bhopal factory but dropped their plans after facing resistance from activists.",
      "In 2005, India's pollution control board said that the toxic waste would be incinerated in Gujarat but the plan was dropped after protests.",
      "The board later identified sites in Hyderabad and Maharashtra state as well, but faced similar resistance.",
      "The Bhopal gas tragedy is the one of the world's largest industrial disasters.",
      "According to government estimates, around 3,500 people died within days of the gas leak and more than 15,000 in the years since.",
      "But activists say that the death toll is much higher. Victims continue to suffer from the side-effects of being poisoned even today.",
      "In 2010, an Indian court convicted seven former managers at the plant, handing down minor fines and brief prison sentences. But many victims and campaigners say that justice has still not been served, given the magnitude of the tragedy.",
      "Union Carbide paid $470m (\u00a3282m) in compensation to the Indian government in an out-of-court settlement in 1989. Another US firm Dow Chemicals, which bought Union Carbide in 1999, says this settlement resolved all existing and future claims against the company."

      "\"It's the same everywhere.\"",
      "Transnistria split from the rest of Moldova in a short war as the Soviet Union fell apart. It still has Russian troops on its soil and an economy that's fully dependent on Russian gas, for which the authorities in Tiraspol pay nothing.",
      "\"They just have a file, where it says how much the debt is each month,\" explains Jakub Pie\u0144kowski, of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, PSIM. \"But Russia is not interested in asking for this money.\"",
      "Suddenly, that lifeline via Ukraine has been cut.",
      "In some Transnistrian towns, the authorities are setting up \"heating points\" and there are hotlines for help finding firewood. Families have been advised to gather in one room for warmth and seal cracks in the windows and doors with blankets.",
      "New Year's Day in the enclave brought sunshine but the temperature overnight is forecast to fall below 0C.",
      "\"It's chilly now inside the flat,\" local resident Dmitry says. \"And we don't know what frost January will bring.\"",
      "Blackout threats",
      "The electricity is still flowing, for now.",
      "But Transnistria's main power plant in Kurchugan is already being fuelled by coal instead of Russian gas and the authorities say there's only enough of that for 50 days.",
      "That means problems for the rest of Moldova, which gets 80% of its electricity from Kurchugan.",
      "The government in Chisinau says it has enough gas to heat the country until spring and it will switch to buying electricity from Europe, but that means a giant hike in costs.",
      "A state of emergency was introduced last month and businesses and citizens have been told to reduce consumption with the country braced for power cuts.",
      "The abrupt halt in gas via Ukraine affects Slovakia and Hungary, too.",
      "Both have governments sympathetic to Moscow that have been far slower than others in the EU to wean themselves off Russian fuel and stop funding Russia's war. Paying more for alternative supplies will squeeze their budgets.",
      "But Moldova is poorer and less stable - a prolonged crisis could have serious economic and political consequences.",
      "That may well be what Moscow wants.",
      "Russia could supply its allies in Transnistria via Turkey, albeit at a higher cost, which would mean electricity for all Moldova.",
      "Instead, Gazprom claims it has halted supplies because Chisinau is almost $700m in debt. The Moldovan government says an international audit put the true amount at around $9m which has mostly been repaid.",
      "Playing politics?",
      "\"We're treating this not as an energy crisis but a security crisis, induced by Russia to destabilise Moldova both economically and socially,\" Olga Rosca, foreign policy adviser to Moldova's president, told the BBC.",
      "\"This clearly is a shaping operation ahead of parliamentary elections in 2025, to create demand for a return of pro-Russian forces to power.\"",
      "Relations between Moldova and Moscow are tense.",
      "Once part of the USSR, the country has begun talks to join the EU and turned even more firmly away from Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "President Maia Sandu was re-elected last year despite evidence of a massive campaign against her led from Moscow.",
      "It hasn't stopped.",
      "Before her inauguration, Russia's external SVR intelligence agency issued a bizarre statement falsely claiming she planned to take back Transnistria by force to restore energy supplies. It painted the president as \"frenzied\" and \"emotionally unstable\".",
      "Analyst Jakub Pie\u0144kowski agrees that the Kremlin is exploiting Kyiv's decision to ban the transit of Russian gas.",
      "\"It's a reason to make some political and social issues in Moldova,\" he argues. \"Electricity prices have already risen about six times in three years and people are angry.\"",
      "As the humanitarian situation in Transnistria worsens, pressure on Chisinau will grow. But Tiraspol is refusing all help, even generators.",
      "\"They will create a narrative of Chisinau freezing Transnistria into submission,\" Olga Rosca believes.",
      "And even if Tiraspol opts to buy gas from elsewhere, the hit to its economy could be disastrous.",
      "\"The prices here would shoot up, including for heating and food. But pensions here are tiny, and there's no work,\" Dmitry told me, from Bendery in the buffer zone on the edge of Transnistria.",
      "He says people there are barely \"clinging on\" as it is. Now life elsewhere in Moldova will also get harder.",
      "\"Russia can wait for the elections and then parties who are not pro-EU will probably win,\" Jakub Pie\u0144kowski predicts.",
      "\"Because Maia Sandu can talk about EU accession, but what use is that if people don't have money for electricity or gas?\"",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:15:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Territory is home to over 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, but not everyone wants them there.",
    "story": [
      "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",
      "Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.",
      "'Hero' father killed in crocodile attack",
      "Body found in search for child missing in croc attack",
      "This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.",
      "Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.",
      "His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.",
      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",
      "Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.",
      "\"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,\" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.",
      "\"The bit I don't have to tell you\u2026 [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.\"",
      "For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.",
      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",
      "\"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,\" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.",
      "He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.",
      "\"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator\u2026and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.",

      "This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024.",
      "The Shenzhen firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.",
      "The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars.",
      "BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.",
      "It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.",
      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",
      "Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.",
      "At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.",
      "Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.",
      "Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.",

      "BYD has still been expanding its foothold in emerging economies.",

      "\"What we're seeing now is a very smart strategy exercise by President Zelensky,\" his former foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told the US Council on Foreign Relations in December.",
      "Zelensky, he said, was \"signalling constructiveness and readiness to engage with President Trump.\"",
      "With little obvious sign that the Kremlin is making similar gestures, the government in Kyiv is clearly trying to get ahead of the game.",
      "\"Because Trump hasn't fully explained how he's going to go about it, Ukrainians are trying to give him some ideas that he may present as his own,\" says Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House.",
      "\"They know how to work with that ego.\"",
      "The Victory Plan: possible endgames",
      "Even before the US election, there were signs that Zelensky was looking for ways to bolster Ukraine's appeal as a future partner for a president-elect like Trump who is both instinctively transactional and reluctant to continue underwriting wider European security.",
      "As part of his \"Victory Plan\", unveiled in October, Zelensky suggested that battle-hardened Ukrainian troops could replace US forces in Europe after the war with Russia ends. And he offered the prospect of joint investments to exploit Ukraine's natural resources, including uranium, graphite and lithium.",
      "Such strategic resources, Zelensky warned, \"will either strengthen Russia or Ukraine and the democratic world\".",
      "But other elements of the Ukrainian leader's Victory Plan - Nato membership and its call for a \"comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package\" - seem to have met with a lukewarm response among Kyiv's allies.",
      "Nato membership in particular remains a sticking point, as it has been since well before Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "For Kyiv, it's the only way to guarantee the country's future survival, against a rapacious Russian enemy bent on subjugating Ukraine.",
      "But despite declaring last July that Ukraine was on an \"irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership\" the alliance is divided, with the US and Germany not yet in favour of issuing an invitation.",
      "President Zelensky has indicated that if an offer of membership was extended to the whole country, within Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders, he would be willing to accept that it would apply, initially, only to territory under Kyiv's control.",
      "This, he told Sky News in November, could end the \"hot stage\" of the war, allowing a diplomatic process to address the question of Ukraine's final borders.",
      "But, he said, no such offer had yet been made.",
      "Kyiv's shaky position",
      "If not Nato, then what? With the possibility of Trump-led peace talks looming and Ukraine losing ground on the battlefield, the international debate is all about shoring up Kyiv's shaky position.",
      "\"It's critical to have strong, legal and practical guarantees,\" Andriy Yermak, head of President Zelensky's office, told Ukraine's public broadcaster on 12 December.",
      "Ukraine's recent past, he said, had left a bitter legacy. \"Unfortunately, from our experience, all the guarantees we had before did not result in security.\"",
      "Without concrete mechanisms akin to the sort of collective defence concept embodied by Article 5 of Nato's founding treaty, observers fear there will be nothing to prevent another Russian attack.",
      "\"Zelensky understands that he cannot just have a naked ceasefire,\" Orysia Lutsevych says.",
      "\"It has to be a ceasefire plus. It would be suicide for Zelensky just to accept a ceasefire and not to have any answer how Ukraine is protected.\"",
      "In European policy forums, experts have been looking at ways in which Europe might help to shoulder this heavy responsibility.",
      "Ideas have included the deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine (a proposal first floated last February by Macron), or the involvement of the British-led Joint Expeditionary Force, which pulls together forces from eight Nordic and Baltic countries, plus the Netherlands.",
      "But Kofman is sceptical. \"Security guarantees that don't have the United States involved in them as one of the guarantors is like a donut with a giant missing middle in it.\"",
      "It's a view echoed in Kyiv.",
      "\"What alternative could there be? There are no alternatives today,\" says Mr Podolyak.",
      "Pieces of paper, like the 1994 Budapest Memorandum (about Ukraine's post-Soviet borders) or 2014-15 Minsk agreements (which sought to end the Donbas War) are worthless, he argues, without the added threat of military deterrence.",
      "\"Russia must understand that as soon as they start aggression, they will receive a significant number of strikes in response,\" he says.",
      "Britain, Biden and the role of the West",
      "In the absence of agreement on Ukraine's long term future, its allies are doing what they can to bolster its defences.",
      "In December, Nato's secretary general, Mark Rutte, said \"everything\" was being looked at, including the supply of additional air defence systems, in part to protect the country's battered energy infrastructure from a renewed wave of coordinated Russian missile and drone attacks.",
      "With Ukraine continuing to experience severe shortages of manpower, the UK Defence Secretary John Healey said the government might be willing to send British troops to Ukraine to help with training.",
      "For its part, the departing Biden administration seems determined to deliver as much congressionally approved military assistance as it can to Ukraine before leaving office, although reports suggest it may run out of time to send everything.",
      "On 21 December it was reported that Trump would continue to supply military aid to Ukraine, but would demand that NATO members dramatically increase their defence spending.",
      "Kyiv's allies have also continued to ratchet up sanctions on Moscow, in the hope that Russia's war-time economy, which has proved stubbornly resilient, may finally break.",
      "\"There's been deep frustration that sanctions haven't just shattered the Russian economy beyond repair,\" a US congressional source said, on condition of anonymity.",
      "After multiple rounds of sanctions (fifteen from the EU alone), government officials have grown wary of predicting their successful impact.",
      "But recent indicators are increasingly alarming for the Kremlin. With interest rates at 23%, inflation running above 9%, a falling rouble and growth expected to slow dramatically in 2025, the strains on Russia's economy have rarely seemed more acute.",
      "Putin is putting on a brave face. \"The sanctions are having an effect,\" he said during his end of year news conference, \"but they are not of key importance.\"",
      "Along with Russia's staggering losses on the battlefield \u2013 western officials estimate that Moscow is losing an average of 1,500 men, killed and wounded, every day \u2013 the cost of this war could yet drive Putin to the negotiating table.",
      "But how much more territory will Ukraine have lost - and how many more people will have been killed - by the time that point is reached?",

    "title": "The Nigerians who yearn for the title 'Leopard Slayer'",
    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:51:45 GMT",
    "summary": "During the festive season, a community in the West African state confers titles to wealthy men in search of prestige.",
    "story": [
      "At the age of 60, Nigerian businessman and healthcare professional Ken Okoroafor achieved his childhood dream of obtaining the revered title of \"Leopard Slayer\".",
      "Jubilant crowds thronged as he was inducted into the prestigious and male-only Igbuu Society in his hometown of Oguta, in south-eastern Nigeria.",
      "In ancient times, slaying a leopard was not just an act of bravery but a ritualistic feat that conferred societal prestige.",
      "To become a \"Leopard Slayer\", known as an \"Ogbuagu\" in the Igbo language, a man had to present a leopard - hunted and killed by himself \u2013 to the local king. Its meat was then shared amongst 25 villages around Oguta.",
      "Over time, the practice evolved, and people no longer needed to hunt the leopard themselves.",
      "My mother recalls the carcass of a leopard lying in their living room back in 1955 when her father took the title. It had been captured for him by a professional hunter.",
      "She remembers eating leopard meat twice in the past: \"It tastes wild and a bit salty.\"",
      "Conservation concerns then ended the use of leopards as they became scarce in the region. The last known leopard sacrifice occurred in 1987.",
      "Once widespread across Nigeria, leopards now tend to be only found in a few national parks, where they are protected.",
      "Today, the financial equivalent - a substantial but undisclosed sum - is distributed among the family heads in the 25 villages, maintaining the communal spirit of the tradition.",
      "\"In Oguta when you join this society, you get respect and you join them in most of the decision-making in the town,\" said Mr Okoroafor, who has lived in the US for decades but returned to his roots to become an Ogbuagu.",
      "\"That attracted me. It's something I've been hoping to join since I was a little boy.\"",
      "The first recorded use of money as a substitute goes back to 1942 when a man named Mberekpe Ojirika caught a leopard for the ceremony, but then his mother passed away.",
      "Tradition stipulated that Ojirika had to mourn for six months and could not continue with the ritual. When he later tried to find another leopard, he failed.",
      "Understanding the difficulty, his relative, the Eze Igwe - the traditional king of Oguta - allowed him to pay four shillings instead of providing a leopard.",
      "\"From that time, you now had a choice to use money or a leopard,\" said 52-year-old Victor Aniche, the current secretary of the Igbuu Society, and a grandson of Ojirika.",
      "\"When I did my own [ceremony] in 2012, someone offered to bring me a live leopard from northern Nigeria. They had one to sell to me. But I couldn't imagine having an endangered animal killed,\" said Mr Aniche, a mechanical engineer and graduate of Cambridge University in the UK.",
      "But today the path to becoming an Ogbuagu is still rigorous, involving three elaborate stages.",
      "The Igbuu Society - of which there are around 75 current members - is as old as Oguta itself, tracing its roots back over four centuries to the town's founding by migrants from the ancient Benin Kingdom.",
      "Despite being classed as part of the Igbo ethnic group, the people of Oguta maintain a distinct identity. Their dialect, customs and traditions set them apart with a local and diaspora population estimated by various sources to be close to 200,000.",
      "Many of those wanting to become an Ogbuagu choose to go through their ceremonies during the festive Christmas season, allowing families and diaspora communities to come together, often drawing large crowds.",
      "On 21 December, Zubby Ndupu, a petrophysicist who works in Nigeria's oil sector, began the first stage to become a \"Leopard Slayer\", known as \"Igbu Agu\" - when the hunt is re-enacted.",
      "The day started at 09:00, with the Ogbuagu gathering in a large tent at Mr Ndupu's home. They greeted each other with the clinking of their gold-coloured swords and exchanged pleasantries.",
      "Although the Eze Igwe does not attend public events, he sent a representative to join the ceremony.",
      "The Ogbuagu sat in order of hierarchy, determined by the date they became full members.",
      "Women were not allowed to touch the Ogbuagu, enter the gathering or participate in the ceremony, but I watched from nearby.",
      "The Ogbuagu feasted on traditional dishes such as goat-meat pepper soup, nsala soup  - made from catfish - pounded yam and palm wine.",
      "During the ceremony, Mr Ndupu was called forward by the secretary: a palm frond was tied to his wrist, chalk marks were drawn on his hand, and he was given a brand-new gold-coloured sword engraved with his name.",
      "He then moved around the gathering, greeting each Ogbuagu and clinking his sword against theirs four times.",
      "In the afternoon, after the feasting, Mr Ndupu was led in a procession from his home. The \"Leopard Slayers\" walked in hierarchical order, with the newest initiate, Mr Ndupu, positioned at the end of the line.",
      "The group proceeded to the Eze Igwe's palace, where they presented money for the leopard to the king.",
      "The second stage, known as \"Iga Aji\", is a spiritual segment conducted privately at the initiate's home - with members of the Igbuu Society in attendance.",
      "During this phase, the initiate is presented with a red sash, symbolising royalty, along with sacred beads and feathers.",
      "After receiving his red sash, Mr Okoroafor went around greeting his kinsfolk, who had gathered in tents outside. They celebrated him with cheers of \"Ogbuagu!\" as they feasted and drank.",
      "The final stage, \"Ipu Afia Agu\", is a grand feast that marks the initiate's full membership. The celebration begins at the home of the initiate's mother and later moves to his own residence.",
      "This is the most expensive stage, often involving livestock, basins of fish and crates of liquor to entertain hundreds of guests.",
      "After a recent gathering at his mother's home, Pascal Okey Adizua, a 60-year-old car dealer from Maryland in the US, was paraded through town with a symbolic, fake leopard skin held high.",
      "Accompanied by the Ogbuagu, chanting women and vibrant music, his new status was celebrated with dancing, singing and feasting shared by all.",
      "Mr Adizua had completed his first stage in 2023 but chose to wait until December 2024 to complete the second and third stages so his daughters - two doctors and a nurse - could attend.",
      "\"My children are all done with school. The last boy is the only one in university. A lot of my friends came from the US,\" said Mr Adizua, who has lived abroad for 21 years.",
      "Both Mr Adizua and Mr Okoroafor, who completed their second and third stages in December, can now savour the unmatched prestige that comes with Igbuu membership.",
      "\"Leopard Slayers\" are addressed by their title \"Ogbuagu\" throughout Igboland - and beyond.",
      "In Oguta, they alone may stand and greet the king without bowing. Their presence commands respect at all events like weddings where they are given seats of honour.",
      "Ceremonial beads worn on the right wrist distinguish the Ogbuagu, symbolising their status. At traditional events, they must wear specific clothing.",
      "\"The title 'Ogbuagu' is a name of praise,\" explains Mr Aniche. \"If you can go into the forest, stalk and kill a leopard, you are a warrior.\"",
      "Leadership in Igbuu follows a strict hierarchy, where seniority is based on how long one has been a member, not age. The longest-serving member holds the highest leadership position. The current leader is Emmanuel Udom, now in his early 80s.",
      "In addition to the president, who oversees the group's affairs and meetings, Igbuu members nominate and elect officials to handle the daily operations and administration. Mr Aniche has served as secretary for the past four years.",
      "\"We have members in their mid-40s all the way to their 90s,\" said Mr Aniche.",
      "Some prominent Ogbuagu include the late Chukwudifu Oputa, one of Nigeria's most respected Supreme Court judges. Alban Uzoma Nwapa, a Swedish-Nigerian musician better known by his stage name Dr Alban, and the late Gogo Nwakuche, a successful entrepreneur and husband of the late renowned novelist Flora Nwapa.",
      "The Igbuu Society is highly selective. Applicants must own property, have a verifiable income, be married or have been married, and maintain an unblemished reputation.",
      "Descendants of slaves, known as \"ohu\", are not allowed to join. These are people whose ancestors were owned by others, either through war or purchase - a remnant of a social order that some are now working to abolish.",
      "\"We are saying now that it is time for this obnoxious, outdated, useless system to be done away with, so that we can be one,\" said Oduenyi Nduka, a former secretary of Igbuu who is also the king's spokesperson.",
      "\"If you go to America, some of our sons are married to black Americans, even some Ogbuagu. Those black Americans are products of the same system, so what is the problem at home?\"",
      "He explained that the traditional process of abolishing the ohu system had already begun, with consultations taking place between families that once owned slaves. This is expected to lead to the enactment of traditional rituals that will officially declare them free of the ohu status.",
      "\"Once that is done, the Igbuu will call a meeting and begin to accept them,\" Mr Nduka said.",
      "Despite its prestige, some criticise the Igbuu, claiming it benefits only the ego of its members.",
      "At every ceremony I attended, there was at least one person in the crowd murmuring about how the thousands of dollars spent could be better used for developing the town or funding scholarships.",
      "But Mr Aniche disagrees: \"Igbuu is not a society where you come to achieve; it is a society you come to because you have already achieved.",
      "\"The Ogbuagu have brought more development to Oguta than others. They are the biggest employers of labour.\"",
      "Mr Aniche also pointed out that the money spent on feasting and other ceremony requirements circulates back into the local economy.",
      "Today, the Igbuu Society's membership spans the globe, with nearly half of its members living abroad. Yet, whether in Europe or the US, Oguta men remain deeply connected to their roots.",
      "\"I come back about three times every year because I love the tradition of Oguta,\" said Mr Adizua. \"With all the stress in the diaspora, I like to come home to unwind.\"",
      "For Mr Okoroafor, the journey from a young boy dreaming of the leopard hunt to an esteemed Ogbuagu was well worth the wait.",
      "\"Oguta is a beautiful town that has a lot of people who excelled in different areas,\" he said, his voice filled with pride.",
      "\"The last time I was home was 2016 but now that I am an Ogbuagu, I will come home more regularly.\"",

      "\"Their lives were in danger, they were exposed to so much killing and destruction,\" says their grandmother, Kawther al-Masri.",
      "An Israeli bombing six weeks ago struck their home in the northern town of Beit Lahia, killing the parents of one-year-old Jamal and the mother and two young sisters of his cousins Maria, Jana and Zeina, aged from two to nine. The girls' father was arrested by Israeli forces more than a year ago.",
      "When the children were pulled from the rubble, they were injured and alone.",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, more than 14,500 children have reportedly been killed, thousands more injured and an estimated 17,000 have been left unaccompanied or separated from the family members who would ordinarily care for them.",
      "Some are too young to know their names and remain unidentified.",
      "In a chaotic situation amid bombings and mass displacement, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, has managed to reunite just 63 children with their parents or guardians. Last month, the BBC followed the story of the four Masri cousins.",
      "\"The happiness of their return is indescribable, but it's overshadowed with sadness - they came back without their parents,\" Kawther al-Masri told us.",
      "Initially, the news that reached Kawther in mid-November was that all of her loved ones who had remained in the family's house in northern Gaza had been killed. But she says that after she prayed, word reached her that three of her grandchildren were still alive.",
      "She immediately knew that she had to bring them to her. \"I longed for them,\" she explains. \"Honestly, I wished I could go to the North and fetch them, but God's will is above everything.\"",
      "For more than a year now, Israel has divided the northern third of the Gaza Strip from the southern two-thirds along the line of a valley, Wadi Gaza. Humanitarian workers have to carry out special co-ordination to cross the Israeli military zone bisecting the territory.",
      "After Kawther collected the documents she needed, Unicef carried out its own welfare checks and went through a laborious process to arrange to move the Masri children.",
      "As the four bereaved cousins underwent medical treatment, distant relatives had looked after them. Unicef filmed their emotional goodbye before it took the children away in armoured vehicles.",
      "The short distance from Gaza City to Deir al-Balah where the convoy was heading now involves crossing an Israeli checkpoint, it takes a long time to drive and can be very risky as the war rages on. Yet Unicef says it is prioritising child reunifications.",
      "\"The challenges are multiple,\" says Rosalia Bollen, a Unicef spokeswoman. \"But we're talking here about highly vulnerable children.\"",
      "\"These are stories of loss \u2013 of deep mental trauma and physical trauma and for these children to recover. The fact that they've been reunified with one or both parents, or a family member, is extremely, extremely important.\"",
      "Kawther describes an agonising wait on the day the children were due to arrive until finally Unicef telephoned. She hadn't seen her grandchildren for 14 months.",
      "\"I didn't know who to hug first!\" she exclaims. \"The first one I hugged was Jana and then Zeina. I kissed her and hugged her.\"",
      "\"My son's children used to call me 'Kuko' and although Zeina couldn't speak the last time I saw her, she knew this was my nickname. She kept asking: 'Are you Kuko? Are you the one I came here for?' And I told her I was. She felt safe.\"",

      "In November 2023, Hamza was arrested by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia. His close relatives insist that he and they are farmers with no political affiliations. The BBC has been unable to get information from the Israeli authorities about what happened to Hamza.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 02:42:33 GMT",
    "summary": "LA is trying to expand its cycling network ahead of the 2028 Olympics, but some are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "From busy freeways to classic-car street racing, Los Angeles has long been considered the capital of American car culture. Can it change in time for the Olympics?",
      "With nearly year-round sunny skies, some say LA is the ideal place for cycling.",
      "\"It is the perfect community for runners and cycling and outdoors, yet as a generality we are hooked on our vehicles, we are hooked on the need to have speed,\" said Damian Kevitt, the executive director of Streets Are For Everyone (Safe).",
      "But until recently, it was cars - and not pedestrians or cyclists - that ruled the roads.",
      "Spreading over 460 square miles (1,200 sq km), Los Angeles is known for its never-ending sprawl, and its traffic jams.",
      "While cities like New York and Boston have embraced mass transit, in LA it never quite caught on - only about 7% of Angelenos take transit to work, according to Neighborhood Data for Social Change.",
      "And while LA weather would be the envy of any Amsterdam cyclist, only about 1% bikes to work.",
      "But with hundreds of thousands of spectators expected to attend the city for the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games, something has to be done to make getting around the city easier.",
      "Los Angeles adopted the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" transport plan in 2017 to expand mass transit options before the summer Olympics. Since then, miles and miles of new bike lanes have been popping up.",
      "\"This is long overdue,\" Mr Kevitt said.",
      "A cyclist who lost his leg in 2013 after a car hit him as he rode his bike in Griffith Park, Kevitt thinks more people will commute using their own bikes or rentable Metro city bikes once the streets are safer and bike lanes are more connected to each other.",
      "LA voters in 2024 overwhelmingly supported a ballot measure to require the city to build more bike lanes and more walkable, livable spaces in Los Angeles.",
      "But will car-loving Angelenos embrace bike culture? Some are actively fighting the changes, grumbling that bike lanes only worsen traffic for cars in the city of stars.",
      "\"What do you mean we voted for it? Not here! Not me!\" said Darin Drabing, the president and CEO of Forest Lawn Cemetery, who is fighting against bike lanes near the cemetery because he thinks it will increase traffic during his commute and funerals.",
      "\"Everywhere I've seen [it] implemented, they failed,\" he said. \"All it does is increase congestion and frustration for people.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 04:23:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Sri Lanka's new rulers are quickly realising that campaign promises are easier to make than to keep.",
    "story": [
      "Stunning election wins by a new left-leaning president and his party have changed Sri Lanka's political landscape - but the cash-strapped island's new rulers are quickly realising that campaign promises are easier to make than to keep.",
      "Anura Kumara Dissanayake's remarkable victory in the presidential election in September was swiftly followed by a landslide for his National People's Power (NPP) alliance in parliamentary elections.",
      "As a new year starts, he and his supporters want this to be a turning point for the country, which is trying to recover from devastating economic crisis and years of misrule.",
      "However, they have limited room for manoeuvre to make good on pledges to voters, whose expectations from the new government are high.",
      "Since the financial meltdown of 2022, economic recovery has been fragile and Sri Lanka is far from out of the woods.",
      "The NPP won 159 seats in the 225-member assembly in November - an unprecedented two-thirds majority \u2013 giving Dissanayake a sweeping mandate to push through major economic and constitutional reforms.",
      "However, even as the results were coming in, the new president had to gear up for a meeting with a visiting delegation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with which the outgoing government had negotiated a $2.9bn (\u00a32.31bn) bailout package.",
      "The IMF deal became controversial as it led to severe austerity measures, tax rises and cuts in energy subsidies - hitting common people hard.",
      "During the campaign Dissanayake and his alliance promised that they would re-negotiate parts of the IMF agreement.",
      "But in his address to the new parliament, he performed a U-turn.",
      "\"The economy is in such a state that it cannot take the slightest shock\u2026 There's no room to make mistakes,\" Dissanayake said.",
      "\"This is not the time to discuss if the terms [of the IMF loan] are good or bad, if the agreement is favourable to us or not... The process had taken about two years, and we cannot start all over again.\"",
      "The voters' overwhelming verdict for the NPP is seen as the culmination of a people's uprising triggered by the economic crisis. The uprising toppled president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the summer of 2022, when Sri Lanka ran out of foreign currency and struggled to import food and fuel.",
      "The country had earlier declared bankruptcy after defaulting on its external debt of about $46bn. India, China and Japan are among those who have loaned billions of dollars.",
      "The recent election results also reflected people's anger towards established political parties - of former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe and others - for failing to handle the economic meltdown.",
      "\"One of the priorities for Dissanayake will be to give some economic relief to the people due to excessive taxation and the cost-of-living crisis. Debt management is another big challenge,\" veteran political analyst Prof Jayadeva Uyangoda told the BBC.",
      "So far the massive political changes don't seem to have had any impact on people like Niluka Dilrukshi, a mother-of-four who lives in a suburb of the capital Colombo. Her husband is a daily-wage labourer and the family still find it hard to get by.",
      "The BBC spoke to her about the soaring cost of living in January 2022, months before mass protests erupted.",
      "At that time, she said her family was eating only two meals a day, instead of three, and they were giving only vegetables and rice to their children due to the high cost of fish and meat.",
      "\"We are still struggling to make ends meet and nothing has changed. The price of rice, which is the staple food, has increased further. We are not getting any relief from the government,\" Mrs Dilrukshi says.",
      "People like her want the new government to take immediate steps to bring down the cost of essentials. Sri Lanka is an import-dependent nation, and it needs foreign currency to bring in items like food and medicine.",
      "For now, Colombo is able to hold on to its currency reserves as it has suspended its debt repayments.",
      "The real struggle, experts point out, will start probably in the next three or four years when it starts repaying its debt.",
      "People's perception of President Dissanayake and his new government could change if there's no visible change in their standard of living in the next two or three years.",
      "\"People have given him a huge mandate. The IMF should respect that by allowing him to give some relief to the people through social welfare programmes,\" says Prof Uyangoda.",
      "Dissanayake must also contend with India and China, which are jostling for influence in Sri Lanka, where both have invested heavily in recent years.",
      "\"Both India and China will try to bring Colombo under their sphere of influence.  I think the new government's foreign policy will be very pragmatic without aligning with anyone,\" says Prof Uyangoda.",
      "In a careful diplomatic manoeuvre, Dissanayake chose Delhi as his first official overseas destination in mid-December. During the visit, India promised to supply liquefied natural gas for Sri Lankan power plants and work on connecting the power grids of the two countries in the long run.",
      "China's increasing foothold in Sri Lanka, especially calls by Chinese \"research\" vessels to the island's ports - so close to India's southern tip - has triggered concern in Delhi.",
      "\"I have given an assurance to the prime minister of India that we will not allow our land to be used in any way in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India,\"  Dissanayake said after talks with Narendra Modi.",
      "Delhi will no doubt be pleased with the assurance, but Dissanayake will find out what Beijing expects when he visits China in mid-January.",

      "What does \"public domain\" mean, exactly?",

      "\"No fees, no licenses, no tracking down the person who owns it, no permission,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024.",
      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2026?",
      "2026 will be another exciting year for the public domain with works from 1930 losing their copyright. Protection will run out for the earliest versions of Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse's dog Pluto and his friend Clarabelle Cow, teen detective Nancy Drew, M.C. Escher's \"The Bridge,\" Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and more.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 06:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer says, apparently ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

      "A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress.",
      "The title was shortened to \"Alice\" and Lavin become a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song \"There's a New Girl in Town,\" ran from 1976 to 1985.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",

      "An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",

      "In her lawsuit, the woman who says she was raped at 13 identifies herself as \"Jane Doe.\" She said she was living in Rochester in 2000 when she made her way to New York City and befriended a limousine driver who drove her to an after-party for the MTV Music Awards, where she says she was eventually attacked by Jay-Z and Combs.",

      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story.

      "\"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is advising residents to not feed their pets Monarch Raw Pet Food sold at several farmers markets in California,\" the agency said, noting that an L.A. county house cat that was fed the product had been confirmed to have the virus. Four other cats from the same home were \"presumed to have also been positive for H5 bird flu after consuming the product.\"",
      "The health department urged residents who fed their pets the Monarch raw food products or any other raw meat or dairy items and noticed their animal exhibiting any unusual behavior to immediately contact their veterinarian.",
      "\"Residents should avoid consumption of all raw milk and raw meat products and not feed these to their pets,\" the agency stressed in its statement Tuesday.",
      "Cats infected with H5N1 bird flu can develop severe illness with symptoms ranging from neurological changes and respiratory problems to liver disease, which can rapidly progress to death.",
      "The health agency said there had been no human cases of bird flu associated with exposure to these cats yet identified.",
      "The Los Angeles health agency did not mention any formal recall of the Monarch products on Tuesday, and the company also provided no information about a recall, or the bird flu cases on its website.",
      "Warning comes after previous raw pet food recall over bird flu",
      "The death of an Oregon house cat and a recent pet food recall had already raised questions about the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and how people can protect their pets.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",

      "Bird flu has been spreading for years in wild birds, chickens, turkeys and many other animals. It was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March.",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. When the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.",
      "Top vet warns against raw food for pets",
      "Oregon health officials traced the cat's illness to the frozen Northwest Naturals cat food that contained raw turkey. Virus recovered from the recalled pet food and the infected cat matched.",
      "Some pet owners feed their animals raw meat, but that can be dangerous, even fatal for the animals, said Dr. Michael Q. Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cooking meat or pasteurizing raw milk destroys the bird flu virus and other disease-causing germs.",
      "\"Raw milk, raw meat products can be and are a vector for carrying this virus,\" he said.",
      "Though cases of infection are rare, cats seem especially susceptible to the bird flu virus, or Type A H5N1. Even before the cattle outbreak, there were feline cases linked to wild birds or poultry. Since March, dozens of cats have caught the virus. These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat, Bailey said, and pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",
      "Don't let them wander freely in the outdoors, he said, \"because you don't know what they're getting into. Cats are natural hunters, and one of the animals they love to hunt are birds.\"",
      "Cat owner worried about bird flu? Here's what to know.",
      "Experts say people should avoid touching sick or dead birds, and thoroughly wash your hands after handling poultry or animals.",
      "Cats sick with bird flu might experience loss of appetite, lethargy and fever.",
      "If your cat is usually playful and likes to look out the window, but instead has been sleeping all the time or hiding from you, take note, Bailey said. \"There's something wrong,\" he said.",
      "They could have reddened or inflamed eyes and discharge from the eyes and nose. They might have difficulty breathing or have tremors or seizures.",
      "If your cat is sick, call your veterinary clinic and keep the cat away from anyone with a weakened immune system.",

    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

      "At a briefing Thursday, the FBI said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation but were still awaiting conclusive DNA identification because the body in the Cybertruck was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms, and that the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "According to CBS News' conversations with his father, Livelsberger was based at Fort Carson but had been serving in Germany. His father said he works with drones. He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials in Nevada are awaiting dental records and DNA test results to verify that the man driving the Cybertruck at the time of this incident was in fact the renter of the vehicle, Livelsberger, but said there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "The Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, McMahill said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",
      "In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said: \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "In the past year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become a major donor and close adviser to Trump, with the billionaire\u00a0tasked to head up\u00a0Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk, along with his co-leader of DOGE, Vivek Ramaswamy, are aiming to cut billions in federal spending.",
      "\"[O]bviously a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel \u2014 there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward with that,\" McMahill said.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a post on X, Musk said \"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.   Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.  We've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "In another post a few hours later, he said the blast \"was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.\"",
      "Evacuation at Trump Las Vegas hotel",
      "A county spokeswoman said in a statement that the fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m. Details about the incident were initially sketchy.",
      "\"I know you have a lot of questions,\" Jeremy Schwartz, acting FBI Special Agent in Charge for the Las Vegas office, said at the news conference. \"We don't have a lot of answers.\"",
      "Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons, posted about the fire on X,\u00a0saying\u00a0that an \"electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte coch\u00e8re of Trump Las Vegas.\"",
      "Officials urged people to stay away from the area around the Trump Las Vegas hotel, which was evacuated. The 64-story hotel is just off the famed Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.",
      "Tesla introduced its steel-clad, futuristic-looking Cybertruck in 2023, with Musk at the time touting the vehicle's bullet-proof windows. The all-wheel Cybertruck ranges in price from about $80,000 to $100,000.",

      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods.",

      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",

    "summary": "Some states are ushering in lower income tax rates in January, part of a recent push to cut taxes for their residents.",
    "story": [
      "Some Americans could get a break on their state income taxes this year, with nine states kicking off 2025 with a reduction in their individual income tax rates, according to an\u00a0analysis from the Tax Foundation, a think tank that focuses on taxes.",
      "The changes are part of a recent push to cut taxes at the state level that started during the pandemic when many states found themselves flush with tax revenue. But the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) has termed the trend an \"anti-tax playbook\" that could eventually crimp public services.",
      "Lawmakers typically argue that lowering taxes can help make their states more competitive, helping to draw businesses and new residents within their borders. Seven of the states that are lowering their individual income taxes in 2025 have legislatures that are controlled by Republicans, as well as Republican governors.",
      "\"The evidence of the past four years indicates that many states understand and value the importance of creating and maintaining a stable, pro-growth and competitive tax code,\" Tax Foundation analysts noted in a blog post on the 2025 changes.",
      "Here are the states where income taxes will be cut starting on Jan. 1, 2025, based on the Tax Foundation's analysis.",
      "Indiana",
      "Indiana, whose state legislature is controlled by GOP lawmakers and whose governor, Eric Holcomb, is a Republican, will shave its income tax rate to 3% in 2025, down from 3.05% in 2024.",
      "That's a fairly small savings for middle-class residents, according to local news outlet IPB News, which estimates the reduction will result in a tax cut of $33 for a worker earning $65,000 a year.",
      "Iowa",
      "Iowa, which also has a Republican trifecta controlling its statehouse and governor's office, is trimming its individual income tax rate to a flat rate of 3.8% starting Jan. 1, down from a top tax rate of 5.7% in 2024, the Des Moines Register reports.",
      "The new flat tax rate was signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May, who, along with state lawmakers, have argued that the state was collecting too much money from its residents, the publication noted.",
      "Louisiana",
      "Another state with a Republican trifecta in the statehouse and governor's office, Louisiana is cutting its individual income tax rate to a flat rate of 3% starting Jan. 1, down from a graduated tax with a top rate of 4.25% in 2024.",
      "Taxpayers in Louisiana who earn between $30,000 to $40,000 a year, the largest number of taxpayers in any bracket in the state, will see their state taxes reduced by 50%, to $338 a year, according to analysis from RESET Louisiana, a nonpartisan public policy think tank.",
      "However, the state's sales tax will jump to 5% in 2025, up from its prior 4.45% rate, partly to pay for the income tax cut, the Tax Foundation noted.",
      "Mississippi",
      "Mississippi, which also has a Republican legislature and governor, will reduce its individual income tax rate to 4.4% on Jan. 1, down from 4.7% in 2024.",

      "Missouri",
      "Another state with a Republican-controlled legislature and Republican governor, MIssouri will trim its state income tax to 4.7% on Jan. 1 from 4.8% in 2024.",

      "Nebraska",
      "Nebraska residents will see their income tax rate decline to 5.2% on Jan. 1, down from 5.84% in 2024, the Tax Foundation said. The Republican Party controls the state legislature, while the state's governor is also a member of the GOP.",
      "New Mexico",
      "New Mexico represents the only state with an income tax reduction on Jan. 1 that sports a Democratic trifecta, meaning its legislature is controlled by the party, while its governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, is also a Democrat.",
      "Starting on Jan. 1, New Mexico's individual income tax brackets will be reduced for all residents, with the biggest cuts aimed at low- and middle-income taxpayers, the Tax Foundation noted. Gov. Grisham's office said in a statement last year that a married couple filing jointly would save about $303 a year under the new tax brackets.",
      "The state will now have six brackets, versus five in 2024, with rates ranging from 1.5% to 5.9%. Some tax rates will remain the same, but others will change. For instance, the lowest bracket was 1.7% in 2024, according to local publication SourceNM.",
      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina, whose legislature is controlled by the Republican Party while its governor is a Democrat, will cut its tax rate to 4.5% on Jan. 1, down from 4.75% in 2024.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:48:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, which closed many businesses and forced government agencies to limit their hours. But Luma noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground power line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria, chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

      "In helping instigate a heated debate over H-1B visas, Elon Musk is speaking both from personal experience and as a business owner.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",
      "Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations, calling them an effort to \"smear\" China's reputation.",
      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",

That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:39:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are calling for the U.S. to admit more foreign tech workers. Not all Republicans agree with them.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he\u00a0told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has \"always been in favor of the visas.\"",
      "\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program,\" he added. His presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Still, Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge to conduct mass deportations, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating.

      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",

      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the Cybertruck was rented to Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, an active duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant, who was serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, the FBI said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation but were still awaiting conclusive DNA identification because the body in the Cybertruck was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms, and that the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "According to CBS News' conversations with his father, Livelsberger was based at Fort Carson but had been serving in Germany. His father said he works with drones. He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials in Nevada are awaiting dental records and DNA test results to verify that the man driving the Cybertruck at the time of this incident was in fact the renter of the vehicle, Livelsberger, but said there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "The Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, McMahill said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",
      "In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said: \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "In the past year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become a major donor and close adviser to Trump, with the billionaire\u00a0tasked to head up\u00a0Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk, along with his co-leader of DOGE, Vivek Ramaswamy, are aiming to cut billions in federal spending.",
      "\"[O]bviously a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel \u2014 there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward with that,\" McMahill said.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a post on X, Musk said \"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.   Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.  We've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "In another post a few hours later, he said the blast \"was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.\"",
      "Evacuation at Trump Las Vegas hotel",
      "A county spokeswoman said in a statement that the fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m. Details about the incident were initially sketchy.",
      "\"I know you have a lot of questions,\" Jeremy Schwartz, acting FBI Special Agent in Charge for the Las Vegas office, said at the news conference. \"We don't have a lot of answers.\"",
      "Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons, posted about the fire on X,\u00a0saying\u00a0that an \"electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte coch\u00e8re of Trump Las Vegas.\"",
      "Officials urged people to stay away from the area around the Trump Las Vegas hotel, which was evacuated. The 64-story hotel is just off the famed Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.",
      "Tesla introduced its steel-clad, futuristic-looking Cybertruck in 2023, with Musk at the time touting the vehicle's bullet-proof windows. The all-wheel Cybertruck ranges in price from about $80,000 to $100,000.",

    "summary": "The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019.",
      "Still, there's the potential for sparks to fly in the House if Republicans revolt against Speaker Mike Johnson during the leadership vote, which is expected to take place shortly after 12 p.m.",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will officially take the reins after flipping the majority in the November elections.",
      "Here's what to know as the new Congress convenes in Washington:",
      "When do the new members of Congress get sworn in?",
      "The new term of Congress, which lasts two years, begins Friday, when House members are expected to be sworn in. But first, they'll have to elect a speaker, which has not come easy for a divided Republican Party in the last two elections to pick their leader.",
      "It took former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, 15 rounds to win the gavel in 2023, delaying the swearing-in of new members by several days. McCarthy was ousted months later, and it took Republicans three weeks to coalesce behind Johnson. The Louisiana Republican is hoping to continue as speaker, but is facing some opposition within his own party after another messy fight last month over government funding.",
      "The Senate swears in members when it convenes Friday and then moves on to other business.",
      "How does the speaker's election work?",
      "Typically, a member from each party will nominate a candidate for speaker ahead of a vote of all incoming members on the House floor. Those candidates were determined in November, when both parties separately decided who they would support for leadership.",
      "Johnson won the backing of Republicans for another term. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, will be nominated by his party. Members are not required to vote for those candidates and could choose to support someone else or no one.",
      "During the roll call vote, members will state aloud who they favor for speaker. The candidate with the majority of votes cast wins the speakership. If no candidate wins on the first round, the vote is repeated until someone secures the majority.",
      "What is the new balance of power in the House and the Senate?",
      "Republicans flipped control of the Senate in the November elections and will have 53 seats. Democrats, including independents who caucus with them, will control 47.",
      "In the House, Republicans held on to their majority, winning 220 seats. Democrats won 215. But President-elect Donald Trump has tapped two Republican members for positions in his administration, cutting into the party's already narrow margins until special elections are held in the coming months. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has also said he would not take his seat, giving Republicans a 219 to 215 edge.",
      "Johnson will need 218 votes to win the speaker's election if all members are present and voting.",
      "What do Republicans want to accomplish first?",
      "Republicans' top priorities include immigration and border security, energy policy and extending tax cuts from Trump's first term. But whether Republicans can quickly accomplish their goals depends on how unified the party is. They plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which would give them the ability to pass large portions of their agenda with a simple majority, avoiding the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of work to build a consensus among all the Republicans to get it done,\" Johnson told Fox News on Monday.",
      "Trump has also called for the debt ceiling to be increased, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills. Without an increase, it's likely to complicate Republicans' legislative priorities.",
      "Who are the new House members joining Congress in 2025?",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden announced Thursday that he is awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal to Rep. Bennie Thompson and former Rep. Liz Cheney, the two lawmakers who led the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Mr. Biden will deliver remarks and present the awards to Thompson, Cheney and more than a dozen other recipients during a ceremony at the White House later Thursday.",
      "\"The Presidential Citizens Medal is awarded to citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others. The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice,\" the White House said in announcing those honored.",
      "Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, served as chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House panel that was tasked with examining the events leading up to and on Jan. 6. In the course of its probe, the committee held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and compiled more than 1 million pages of material.",
      "Its work concluded in December 2022 after an investigation that spanned 18 months. The committee voted to refer President-elect Donald Trump and conservative lawyer John Eastman for criminal prosecution because of their alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6.",
      "Trump was charged with four federal criminal counts stemming from his efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 presidential election, but the charges were dismissed following a request by special counsel Jack Smith in November, after Trump was elected to a second term. The special counsel sought to end the prosecution because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "In its announcement of the recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal, the White House said that throughout Cheney's 20 years in public service, Cheney \"has raised her voice \u2014 and reached across the aisle\u2014to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency. Her integrity and intrepidness remind us all what is possible if we work together.\"",
      "Cheney became an ardent opponent of Trump following the 2020 election and endorsed Harris for president.",
      "The White House said of Thompson that he served \"at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth\" as chair of the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked Cheney, Thompson and the Jan. 6 committee since the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that they committed crimes and should go to jail. He told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in early December that he \"mostly likely\" will issue pardons to those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty for their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "Mr. Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of Trump from both parties to protect them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration, multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions told CBS News earlier this month. Among those who were under consideration are Cheney, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 select committee while in the House, and\u00a0retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist.\"",
      "In addition to Cheney and Thompson, Mr. Biden will award the Presidential Citizens Medal to Mary Bonauto, an attorney who argued the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage; Bill Bradley, a former NBA player and U.S. senator; and Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a nurse during the Vietnam War and founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation.",
      "Former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Ted Kaufman of Delaware will also be honored.",
      "The Presidential Citizens Medal was established in 1969 and is considered the second-highest civilian award of the U.S. government. It recognizes \"citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.\"",

While executing a search warrant at Spafford's 20-acre farm in the county of Isle of Wight, investigators found \"a stockpile of more than 150 homemade improvised explosive devices\" that were assessed to be pipe bombs, according to prosecutors. They said some of the pipe bombs were labeled \"lethal\" and \"preloaded into an apparent wearable vest.\"",
      "Most of the devices were allegedly found in a detached garage, while others were found in a backpack in a bedroom \"completely unsecured.\" Prosecutors said Spafford also \"acknowledged to keeping a jar in his freezer of HMTD, an explosive material that is so unstable it can be exploded merely as a result of friction of temperature changes.\" Investigators found the jar stored next to food items and labeled \"dangerous\" and \"do not touch,\" prosecutors said.",

A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",

      "Washington \u2014 Some of the defendants accused of being part of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, are now asking courts for permission to return to Washington, D.C, on Jan. 20 to attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Many of the approximately 1,600 people who have been charged with felony or misdemeanor crimes for their alleged roles in the Jan. 6 attack have been subjected to court orders restricting their travel to and within the capital. But some have said that they should be afforded permission to return for the inauguration, arguing they are not a threat to public safety.",
      "In a court filing on Monday, the Justice Department argued against allowing defendant Christopher Belliveau to attend the inauguration. \"The last organized event the defendant attended in Washington, D.C., spiraled into a full-scale riot. This was the scene of his charged crime \u2014 a violent felony which contributed to the disruption of the peaceful transition of power,\" federal prosecutors wrote.",
      "\"The most compelling reason to deny Belliveau's motion is that allowing his travel to Washington, D.C. places Capitol Police Officers in danger,\" prosecutors added. \"Belliveau argues that his lack of violent past warrants a modification of his conditions of release. But that makes his return to the Capitol even more concerning \u2014 Belliveau was only willing to engage in violence against Capitol Police Officers who were trying to keep a crowd of rioters under control.\"",
      "Belliveau is accused of deploying bear spray against police during the Capitol attack and has pleaded not guilty. He filed his own motion in support of his request to attend the inauguration. Belliveau's attorneys argued, \"It is also vital to remember that, while Mr. Belliveau stands accused, he is presumed innocent, thus the mere fact that he is charged does not suggest that he is inherently more dangerous that any other person.\"",
      "Defendant Cindy Young, who was found guilty on four criminal charges at trial in August, has also sought permission to travel to Washington for the festivities. In her filing\u00a0on Dec. 11, Young's lawyer said she has \"complied with her conditions of release\" for \"well over a year.\"",
      "\"She poses no threat of danger to the community and she is not a risk of flight. She was allowed to travel several times to Washington, D.C., including to the Capitol building while preparing for trial and there were no incidents,\" Young's attorney said.",
      "But prosecutors opposed Young's request. Writing in response a week later, the Justice Department said Young has \"continuously endorsed calls for retribution against those involved in January 6 prosecutions \u2014 specifically jurors, judges, and law enforcement \u2014 all whom help make up the D.C. community.\" They wrote that Young \"has also mocked officer victims,\" many of whom \"will, once again, be tasked in protecting the Capitol and Constitution on January 20, 2025.\" The judge has not ruled on Young's request.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant who is serving as his own defense lawyer, also requested permission to attend the inauguration. In a filing on Saturday, Pope said, \"I now move the Court for permission to travel to Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending the Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2025. Initially, I had declined an invitation to attend the inauguration (since I don't enjoy being in Washington), however, I have now been asked a second time, and I believe it would be inappropriate for me to turn this request down.\"",
      "Pope has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in May. The court filing did not specify who invited Pope to be in attendance. The Justice Department has not yet responded to the request.",
      "Trump has pledged to pardons at least some of those charged or convicted with crimes related to Jan. 6.\u00a0 According to the latest Justice Department report, approximately 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty. Roughly 600 have been charged with assaulting or resisting police. There are several fugitives being sought by federal agents, with more arrests still expected.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration imposed new sanctions on Russian and Iranian entities over their attempts to interfere in the 2024 election, the Treasury and State Departments announced Tuesday.",
      "Specifically, the Treasury Department is imposing fresh sanctions on a subsidiary of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps known as the Cognitive Design Production Center, as well as the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise and its director, Valery Mikhaylovich Korovin, affiliates of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate.",
      "Bradley Smith, the Treasury Department's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the \"governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns.\"",

      "\"These actors sought to stoke sociopolitical tensions and undermine our election institutions during the 2024 U.S. general election,\" Miller said in a statement.",
      "The Treasury Department said the Russian entities used generative AI tools to create disinformation to distribute across websites designed to create false corroboration between the stories. The Treasury Department said Russia also manipulated videos to its benefit.",
      "Treasury said Iran used social engineering to access people with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both parties, something the U.S. warned was happening earlier this year.",
      "The designation means all property and interests of the affected targets that are in the U.S. or under U.S. control are blocked and must be reported. The fresh sanctions come as President Biden is wrapping up his agenda less than three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Ahead of the election, the Biden administration warned that multiple countries, including Russia, Iran and China, were trying to unduly influence U.S. elections. In July, CBS News reported that U.S. intelligence detected an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump. Trump ordered the 2020 airstrike that killed\u00a0top Iranian commander Gen. Qasem Soleimani.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:56:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Vacancies Reform Act sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacancies throughout the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to begin his second term in the White House in just a few weeks, he has suggested that he will use recess appointments to circumvent the Senate confirmation process and quickly install his picks to key positions across the federal government.",
      "The demand has been met with pushback from some Republicans, but there is another way in which Trump could place those loyal to him in high-ranking positions without Senate approval, albeit temporarily: a 25-year-old federal law that sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacant positions that require Senate confirmation.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, or the Vacancies Act, limits which government employees can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and approval by the Senate.",
      "The playbook wouldn't be new to Trump, who installed \"acting\" leaders atop various federal agencies and subagencies in his first term, including the Departments of Defense and Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Some of the president-elect's nominees are likely to face headwinds in the GOP-led Senate, like Pete Hegseth, his pick to lead the Pentagon and Tulsi Gabbard, who he plans to tap for director of national intelligence. The Vacancies Act could become a key tool for Trump to ensure agencies are staffed with those loyal to him and his agenda.",
      "\"Congress has made the policy choice to have about 1,300 positions still require Senate consent,\" said Thomas Berry, a legal scholar at the Cato Institute. \"But what we have now is that any given time, half or more than half of those are filled not by Senate-confirmed people, not because Congress made that policy choice, but because the Vacancies Act can be pushed to the limit and maybe even beyond its limits, and it's so easy to have acting officers or sub-delegates essentially act in exactly the same way they would if they were Senate confirmed for years at a time.\"",
      "How the Vacancies Act works",
      "Under the Vacancies Act, there are three categories of federal workers who can temporarily fill a position covered by the law:",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant officeAnother administration official who has already won Senate confirmationAn agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office",
      "Another administration official who has already won Senate confirmation",
      "An agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The Vacancies Act also sets a time limit for how long an acting official can serve, allowing them to fill the position for 300 days when installed at the beginning of a new administration. Temporary leaders elevated after the start of a term can remain in their role for 210 days, but that cap can be extended if a nomination is pending in the Senate. If a nomination is rejected, returned or withdrawn, the president gets another 210 days.",
      "When Trump took office after he was inaugurated the first time in January 2017, he tapped noncontroversial, longtime civil servants to serve in acting roles while the confirmation process played out, Berry said. He could do the same again for the first days or weeks after he returns to the White House on Jan. 20.",
      "But Berry said the landscape will shift as Trump's second term progresses. Eventually, there will be Senate-confirmed officials in lower-level positions and those at the highest pay grade who have served in their agencies for more than 90 days. Those officials could be then tapped for acting positions.",
      "\"The vacancies people should be more concerned about, the vacancies where Trump has a lot more flexibility, are the ones that occur in the middle of the term, not right on day one,\" he said.",
      "Presidents of both parties have installed acting officials in high-ranking positions in their administrations. But with 30 acting secretaries, Trump used more temporary leaders than those who were confirmed during his first four years in the White House, according to research from Anne Joseph O'Connell, a law professor at Stanford University who has extensively studied the Vacancies Act.",
      "How much Trump relies on the 1998 law in the early months of his second term could depend on his legislative priorities. With a Republican-controlled Congress, the president-elect and GOP lawmakers have said they plan to focus on extending Trump's signature tax reform law, portions of which are set to expire next year, as well as border security. And if a member of the Supreme Court retires, filling that seat would also be a significant priority while Republicans have a Senate majority.",
      "\"I assume, given the threat to use the recess appointments clause, that the Senate party leadership is going to work closely with the White House to get the Cabinet or most confirmed quickly through the traditional process, so then the question is, what else will the Senate make a priority?\" O'Connell said. \"The Vacancies Act offers a second-best pathway for filling agency positions.\"",
      "Since winning the White House in November, Trump has rolled out a slew of personnel picks, ranging from those who will serve in his Cabinet if nominated and confirmed by the Senate to candidates for ambassadorships to senior White House staff who do not require Senate approval. One of those candidates, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, whom the president-elect selected for attorney general, took himself out of consideration after he came under renewed scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he denied.",
      "While much of the focus is on Trump's picks for the most senior roles in his new administration, the leaders of subagencies could be filled through the Vacancies Act or through a delegation of duties to subordinates.",
      "\"That strategy can be done at these very influential positions that are just below the secretary level, and that's why you more often see pushing the boundaries of the Vacancies Act at that level,\" Berry said.",

      "The court roundly rejected claims by Trump and his lawyers that the judge who presided over the trial made a series of decisions that harmed Trump's standing with the jury.",
      "Trump asked for a new trial after a jury unanimously concluded in May 2023 that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store. Monday's 77-page decision rejected complaints made repeatedly by Trump before, during and after the nine-day trial.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York, found that District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing the testimonies of two women who made claims on the stand of alleged encounters with Trump that bore similarities to Carroll's.",
      "\"With his shoulder and the whole weight of his body against her, Mr. Trump held her against the wall, kissed her, pulled down her tights, and stuck his fingers into her vagina \u2014 until Ms. Carroll managed to get a knee up and push him back off of her,\" the appeals court wrote, summarizing evidence and testimony of Carroll's claim.",
      "Carroll said she and Trump bumped into each other by chance while shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. What started as a pleasant walk through the store \u2014 her helping him choose a present for another woman, as they engaged in jocular banter \u2014 turned violent in a changing room, she alleged.",
      "Trump has vehemently denied Carroll's allegations, and vowed to appeal the case as far as the Supreme Court. He has also appealed a January 2024 trial ruling that found him liable for more defamation against Carroll. That appeal is still pending. The juries in the two cases combined awarded Carroll more than $88 million.",
      "Attorneys for Trump did not immediately reply to a request for comment. A spokesman for Trump, Steven Cheung, said he plans to appeal, and said Americans who voted for Trump demand \"a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts.\"",
      "Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, thanked the appeals court for \"its careful consideration of the parties' arguments,\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" said Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.",
      "Among Trump's complaints about the trial was that the jurors were shown an outtake from \"Access Hollywood,\" in which Trump could be heard describing grabbing women's genitals. The clip was widely shared during the 2016 presidential race. The court found that Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing that video to be shown.",
      "Carroll's federal civil lawsuit made claims of rape, sexual abuse and defamation as defined by New York's penal code. The jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but rejected the rape claim, which under New York's statute requires proof of forceful penetration involving the attacker's genitals.",
      "The judge later wrote that New York's penal code is out of touch with federal standards and a \"modern\" understanding of what rape is. In post-trial rulings he wrote that Carroll's assertion that Trump raped her was \"substantially true.\"",
      "\"The definition of rape in the New York Penal Law is far narrower than the meaning of 'rape' in common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote in July 2023",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 09:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Hundreds of new species across the globe were identified by scientists in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "A vampire hedgehog, a pygmy pipehorse and a \"blob-headed\" fish were among the hundreds of new species identified in 2024.",
      "The variety of species identified was quite eclectic and names for the new species crossed a broad spectrum of locations and formations \u2014 some even inspired by politicians or celebrities.",
      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",
      "Here are some of the 2024 highlights.",
      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",
      "\"The function of this unusual structure remains a mystery,\" researchers said in a statement.",
      "However, the species was already familiar to Indigenous Awajun people who were working with the Rapid Assessment Program, researchers said.",

      "The new year will kick off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is set to peak early on Friday.",
      "The Quadrantids have the potential of 200 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, but most astronomy fans can catch 20-30 meteors an hour under clear, dark skies during the peak, according to NASA. The moon will be a \"mere crescent\" and set early in the night, which should make for good meteor viewing conditions, according to the space agency.",
      "When and where you can see the Quadrantids",
      "The meteor shower will peak in the early morning hours on Friday, according to NASA. While meteor showers last for days, the per hour rate of meteors will be best during the peak and the highest as dawn approaches.",
      "The Quadrantids will be active until Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas well away from city and street lights. The Quadrantids are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and observers in the Northwest and Pacific region will likely have the best viewing opportunities this year.",
      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. They streak through the sky every night, and when Earth encounters many meteors at once, it's called a meteor shower. The meteors heat up as they pass through the atmosphere, making them look like shooting stars.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Quadrantids come from asteroid 2003 EH1 \u2014 a small asteroid that was discovered on March 6, 2003.",
      "The Quadrantids are also known for their bright fireball meteors, with larger explosions of light and color that can last longer than an average meteor streak, according to NASA.",

      "The upcoming year is poised to bring a packed schedule of astral shows, from lunar phenomena to planetary wonders that involve several of Earth's neighbors in the solar system. For skywatchers looking to mark their calendars, here are the top celestial events to watch in 2025.",
      "Jan. 3: Quadrantid meteor shower",
      "Next year's first astral spectacle comes early, on Jan. 3, when the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. Considered one of the most impressive annual meteor showers to witness, the event can produce between 60 and 200 visible meteors under perfect weather conditions, according to NASA.",

      "The first full moon of 2025 is called the Wolf Moon. It's also a supermoon, set to appear in night skies Jan. 13, and will pass in front of Mars during a phenomenon known as occultation. People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",
      "March 29: Partial solar eclipse",
      "A partial solar eclipse will take shape a couple weeks later, on March 29. Like the lunar eclipse preceding it, this is the first of two partial solar eclipses slated for 2025, but the only one that will be visible in North America next year.",
      "The opposite of a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow onto the planet as it appears to cover the star. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",
      "The Lyrid meteor shower\u00a0is active from April 15 to April 30 next year, according to the American Meteorological Society. It is expected to peak between April 21 and April 22, with people in the Northern Hemisphere most likely to spot the sparkling display.",
      "Aug. 12-13: Perseid meteor shower",
      "The Perseid meteor shower\u00a0will peak between Aug. 12 and Aug. 13. Dubbed the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, this shower typically has the capacity to produce 50 to 100 visible meteors per hour when skies are clear enough to see them and they aren't overpowered by moonlight.",
      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",
      "Another partial solar eclipse is set for Sept. 21. This one will be visible in parts of Australia, in addition to Antarctica and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.",
      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",
      "Dec. 13-14: Geminid meteor shower",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Wednesday will mark the 235 judicial confirmations he secured during his single term in the White House, a figure that surpasses that of his predecessor, President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Mr. Biden is set to deliver remarks from the White House highlighting the judges that he nominated and the Democrat-led Senate confirmed to the federal bench. The president's judicial record includes one appointment to the Supreme Court, 45 to the federal courts of appeals, 187 to the U.S. district courts and two to the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Mr. Biden's pick of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court was historic, as she is the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.",
      "Since the start of his administration in 2021, the president, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was in the upper chamber, had pledged to diversify the federal bench by appointing judges from varying professional and personal backgrounds. Mr. Biden's judicial nominees included more than 45 public defenders, including Jackson, and 25 civil rights attorneys.",
      "In addition to tapping the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Mr. Biden also named more Black women to the federal courts of appeals than every previous presidential administration combined, according to the White House.",
      "The 235 judicial confirmations marks the largest number in a four-year term since the late President Jimmy Carter was in office and surpasses Trump's appointments to the federal bench by one. Carter did not appoint any justices to the Supreme Court, but selected a record 262 judges to the federal courts after Congress in 1978 passed legislation creating 35 new appeals court judgeships and 117 district court seats.",

    "summary": "Law enforcement in Las Vegas provided an update on the investigation into a Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel there early Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities investigating the Tesla Cybertruck explosion\u00a0outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day said Thursday that evidence shows the driver shot himself in the head before the explosion.",
      "The Cybertruck had been rented by Matthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old active duty member of the Army Special Forces.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department referred to the driver of the truck as the subject of the investigation, and said there are no other subjects at this time.",
      "The driver who died was the only person in the vehicle when it went up in flames. He is also the only person known by police to have been inside the 2024 model Cybertruck since it was rented, according to the sheriff. But the condition of the body has prevented law enforcement from making a definitive identification until they receive dental records and DNA test results.",
      "\"His body is burnt beyond recognition, and I do still not have confirmation 100% that that is the individual that was inside of our vehicle,\" McMahill said. Investigators said Livelsberger's military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "\"Further complicating this identification of this individual, we also discovered through the coroner's office that the individual had sustained a gunshot wound to the head prior to the detonation of the vehicle,\" the sheriff continued. McMahill said one of the handguns discovered inside the vehicle after it exploded was found at the person's feet.",
      "The explosion early Wednesday morning is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, according to law enforcement, but investigators do not believe there are any lingering threats to the community, FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz said at a news conference Wednesday evening.",
      "Seven others suffered minor injuries from the explosion.",
      "Law enforcement sources said Livelsberger was stationed in Germany but was on leave in Colorado when the blast occurred. Two of Livelsberger's relatives told CBS News they were unaware of his involvement in the incident but confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative said his wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents probing the explosion have been at Livelsberger's townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday night, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "The Cybertruck was rented in Colorado, McMahill said. Investigators were able to trace its route from Denver to Las Vegas based on its stops at charging stations, and surveillance video shows the vehicle driving through the Las Vegas Strip shortly before the blast.",
      "The Cybertruck pulled up to the glass entrance of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas a little after 7:30 a.m., and exploded about 15 seconds later.",
      "The sheriff told reporters that gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were discovered in the back of the truck, although it was unclear exactly how the explosives were ignited.",
      "McMahill called the explosion \"an isolated incident\" and said there was no indication it was connected to ISIS. The blast came just hours after a man intentionally\u00a0drove a pickup truck flying a black ISIS flag\u00a0into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people before he was fatally shot police.",
      "The Las Vegas sheriff reiterated Thursday that the two incidents were unrelated, although he acknowledged some similarities between the cases and subjects. The drivers in both the Cybertruck explosion and the New Orleans rampage had rented their respective vehicles using the company Turo, and both were members of the U.S. military. Each served in Afghanistan in 2009 and at some point were stationed at the military base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Authorities are still investigating, but McMahill said there was no evidence indicating the men served in the same units or locations in Afghanistan, or served at Fort Bragg during the same years.",

      "The attack, which officials said left at least 14 people dead and injured dozens of others, is being investigated as an act of terrorism, the FBI said. Flying from the truck's rear bumper was a black ISIS flag. The FBI has identified Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old from Texas, as the man driving the vehicle. Jabbar had \"posted videos to social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill,\" President Biden said Wednesday.",
      "The agency confirmed the attack was inspired by ISIS, and the attacker had an ISIS flag attached to the hitch of the truck, the aide said.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, the FBI has seized cellphones from the attacker and received approximately 239 leads from the public, as well as conducted over 10 interviews with associates and family members of the attacker, the aide said. The attacker, who was born in the U.S. and is an American citizen, was not on any federal government watchlists or systems, the aide said.",
      "The New Orleans terrorist attack happened the same day that a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside of Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. That explosion, which happened early Wednesday morning, is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, according to law enforcement.",
      "The FBI has not found any connection between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion at this time, but the Army Criminal Investigation Division is conducting an ongoing probe, the committee aide said.",
      "The Committee will continue conducting oversight of the federal government's response to both incidents, the aide said.",
      "The FBI is leading the investigation, and Mr. Biden said in a statement that he has directed his administration to \"ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Troy Carter, who represents the district and serves on the Homeland Security Committee, said on \"CBS Mornings\" that he believes New Orleans is secure, citing the FBI's assessment.

    "story": [
      "The investigation into the truck attack on New Orleans' Bourbon Street\u00a0continued Thursday after a driver plowed into a crowd of New Year's Day revelers, killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker posted videos declaring his support for ISIS shortly before the deadly rampage, the FBI said Thursday.",
      "The driver of the truck, who was shot and killed by police moments after he drove into the crowd, was identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas. He had previously served in the U.S. military, including an 11-month deployment to Afghanistan, according to an Army spokesperson. He was discharged in 2015 and worked in real estate in recent years. His most recent address was in Houston.",
      "The FBI initially said that 15 people, excluding the driver, died in the attack. The number was revised by the New Orleans coroner's office on Thursday to say that the figure included the attacker.",
      "Investigators are continuing to search for a motive. Officials repeatedly said on Wednesday and Thursday that they thought Jabbar may have had help with the attack, but a U.S. official with the investigation told CBS News late Thursday morning that the FBI now believes there were no accomplices.",
      "\"At this point, currently, and this is another fact I want to be clear on, we do not assess at this point that anyone else is involved in this attack except Shamsud-Din Jabbar,\" deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Christopher Raia said in a news conference on Thursday.",
      "Jabbar had rented a Ford electric pickup truck from the peer-to-peer rental app Turo. Raia said Jabbar picked up the car in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove to New Orleans on Dec. 31. Raia said the attacker had posted five videos while driving between the two cities. President Biden referenced the videos in\u00a0televised remarks Wednesday evening. In the videos, the man proclaimed his support for ISIS and said he had joined the terror organization before this summer, Raia said.",
      "In one of those videos, he said that he had planned to attack family and friends, but \"was concerned the news headlines would not focus on the quote, 'war between the believers and the disbelievers,' end quote,\" Raia said.",
      "Early Wednesday morning, just hours after New Orleans had rung in 2025, authorities say Jabbar drove onto the sidewalk of Bourbon Street, swerving around barriers, to drive\u00a0into a crowd of revelers. He then got out of the car and began firing at police officers. He died after exchanging gunfire with three responding officers, the FBI said. The New Orleans Police Department\u00a0said\u00a0he was struck by police fire and declared dead at the scene.",
      "Raia said it's not clear why Jabbar decided to attack Bourbon Street, but said he was \"100% inspired by ISIS\" and said the investigation into his motive for the attack was ongoing.",
      "There have been many conflicting reports of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, found at the scene and in the French Quarter. Raia said that two devices were found in the French Quarter. Both devices were active and were found in coolers near intersections in the area. Both were \"rendered safe\" where they were found, Raia said. Surveillance footage showed Jabbar placing the devices where they were found, Raia said.",
      "A person familiar with the investigation told CBS News that the devices were rudimentary pipe bombs that contained shrapnel including nails, screws and tacks.",
      "Raia said that investigators found two other items of interest that were determined not to be IEDs. He said there have been reports of other devices, but said those reports are misinformation or were for non-functioning devices.",
      "\"We do not believe the public is in any danger around any of these locations,\" Raia said.",
      "Two law enforcement sources told CBS News that Jabbar had an AR-15-style weapon and a handgun with him at the time of the attack. Law enforcement sources had described one of the weapons as a long gun with a suppressive device acting as a silencer. Investigators are looking into whether Jabbar illegally acquired the weapons. He was also wearing body armor, according to two sources familiar with the investigation.",
      "Investigators have recovered three phones and two laptops, Raia said. Those devices are being reviewed, he said. Evidence technicians will also continue to go over the truck, Raia said. He said investigators have also conducted \"hundreds of interviews\" in relation with the attack.",
      "\"There's nothing to indicate through call records, through anything on those devices, through interviews, through anything in our systems, that he was aided in this attack by anybody,\" Raia said.",
      "Raia said Bourbon Street has been released as a crime scene. New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell said the city wants to have the street open again to pedestrians by the start of the Sugar Bowl game, which was scheduled for Wednesday evening and postponed to Thursday afternoon following the attack.",
      "Raia also said that \"at this point, there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas,\" where a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside of the Trump Towers hotel Wednesday morning.",
      "Both attacks used vehicles rented through Turo, and both attacks involved U.S.-born military servicemen who had served in Afghanistan around the same time, though two U.S. officials told CBS News that they have found no overlap between the two men.

      "Washington \u2014 The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019.",
      "Still, there's the potential for sparks to fly in the House if Republicans revolt against Speaker Mike Johnson during the leadership vote, which is expected to take place shortly after 12 p.m.",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will officially take the reins after flipping the majority in the November elections.",
      "Here's what to know as the new Congress convenes in Washington:",
      "When do the new members of Congress get sworn in?",
      "The new term of Congress, which lasts two years, begins Friday, when House members are expected to be sworn in. But first, they'll have to elect a speaker, which has not come easy for a divided Republican Party in the last two elections to pick their leader.",
      "It took former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, 15 rounds to win the gavel in 2023, delaying the swearing-in of new members by several days. McCarthy was ousted months later, and it took Republicans three weeks to coalesce behind Johnson. The Louisiana Republican is hoping to continue as speaker, but is facing some opposition within his own party after another messy fight last month over government funding.",
      "The Senate swears in members when it convenes Friday and then moves on to other business.",
      "How does the speaker's election work?",
      "Typically, a member from each party will nominate a candidate for speaker ahead of a vote of all incoming members on the House floor. Those candidates were determined in November, when both parties separately decided who they would support for leadership.",
      "Johnson won the backing of Republicans for another term. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, will be nominated by his party. Members are not required to vote for those candidates and could choose to support someone else or no one.",
      "During the roll call vote, members will state aloud who they favor for speaker. The candidate with the majority of votes cast wins the speakership. If no candidate wins on the first round, the vote is repeated until someone secures the majority.",
      "What is the new balance of power in the House and the Senate?",
      "Republicans flipped control of the Senate in the November elections and will have 53 seats. Democrats, including independents who caucus with them, will control 47.",
      "In the House, Republicans held on to their majority, winning 220 seats. Democrats won 215. But President-elect Donald Trump has tapped two Republican members for positions in his administration, cutting into the party's already narrow margins until special elections are held in the coming months. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has also said he would not take his seat, giving Republicans a 219 to 215 edge.",
      "Johnson will need 218 votes to win the speaker's election if all members are present and voting.",
      "What do Republicans want to accomplish first?",
      "Republicans' top priorities include immigration and border security, energy policy and extending tax cuts from Trump's first term. But whether Republicans can quickly accomplish their goals depends on how unified the party is. They plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which would give them the ability to pass large portions of their agenda with a simple majority, avoiding the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of work to build a consensus among all the Republicans to get it done,\" Johnson told Fox News on Monday.",
      "Trump has also called for the debt ceiling to be increased, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills. Without an increase, it's likely to complicate Republicans' legislative priorities.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden announced Thursday that he is awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal to Rep. Bennie Thompson and former Rep. Liz Cheney, the two lawmakers who led the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Mr. Biden will deliver remarks and present the awards to Thompson, Cheney and more than a dozen other recipients during a ceremony at the White House later Thursday.",
      "\"The Presidential Citizens Medal is awarded to citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others. The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice,\" the White House said in announcing those honored.",
      "Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, served as chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House panel that was tasked with examining the events leading up to and on Jan. 6. In the course of its probe, the committee held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and compiled more than 1 million pages of material.",
      "Its work concluded in December 2022 after an investigation that spanned 18 months. The committee voted to refer President-elect Donald Trump and conservative lawyer John Eastman for criminal prosecution because of their alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6.",
      "Trump was charged with four federal criminal counts stemming from his efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 presidential election, but the charges were dismissed following a request by special counsel Jack Smith in November, after Trump was elected to a second term. The special counsel sought to end the prosecution because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "In its announcement of the recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal, the White House said that throughout Cheney's 20 years in public service, Cheney \"has raised her voice \u2014 and reached across the aisle\u2014to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency. Her integrity and intrepidness remind us all what is possible if we work together.\"",
      "Cheney became an ardent opponent of Trump following the 2020 election and endorsed Harris for president.",
      "The White House said of Thompson that he served \"at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth\" as chair of the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked Cheney, Thompson and the Jan. 6 committee since the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that they committed crimes and should go to jail. He told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in early December that he \"mostly likely\" will issue pardons to those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty for their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "Mr. Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of Trump from both parties to protect them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration, multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions told CBS News earlier this month. Among those who were under consideration are Cheney, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 select committee while in the House, and\u00a0retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist.\"",
      "In addition to Cheney and Thompson, Mr. Biden will award the Presidential Citizens Medal to Mary Bonauto, an attorney who argued the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage; Bill Bradley, a former NBA player and U.S. senator; and Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a nurse during the Vietnam War and founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation.",
      "Former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Ted Kaufman of Delaware will also be honored.",
      "The Presidential Citizens Medal was established in 1969 and is considered the second-highest civilian award of the U.S. government. It recognizes \"citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.\"",

    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods.",

      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan,",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 02:42:04 -0500",
    "summary": "A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 skidded down the runway and crashed in a fireball in South Korea, and investigators are just beginning the process of figuring out why.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean officials have\u00a0vowed to find out what caused a Boeing 737-800 passenger jet operated by Jeju Air to crash into flames as it attempted to land over the weekend, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. Days after the crash, there were still far more questions than answers about the country's worst aviation disaster in decades.",
      "Authorities ordered an immediate inspection of all 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines \u2014 dozens of planes in total \u2014 following the crash, but there was still no clear indication as to whether a system malfunction, human error, or some combination of factors had caused the disaster.",
      "Experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing were on the ground inspecting the crash site, and the NTSB was set to play a crucial role in deciphering data from the plane's \"black boxes,\" which record information from the cockpit and aircraft systems.",
      "Officials have warned it could be months before any clear answers emerge. Here is a look at what's known about the Jeju Air crash, and some of the key questions emerging in the wake of the tragedy.",
      "What happened in the South Korean plane crash?",
      "Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 departed from Bangkok, Thailand, and approached for its scheduled landing Sunday at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea.",
      "After an initial failed landing attempt, the Boeing 737-800 received a bird strike warning from the ground control center. It then ascended again before trying to land a second time.",
      "Two minutes later, the plane's crew sent a distress signal and attempted to land on a different runway. The plane touched down three minutes later without lowering its nose landing gear.",
      "It skidded along the runway at high speed, overshot the end of the runway and slammed into a concrete fence, bursting into a fireball. The only survivors were two crew members rescued from the tail section.",
      "Observers say videos of the crash suggested the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely the main reason for the crash.",
      "The plane's flight data and cockpit audio recorders \u2014 the so-called \"black boxes\" \u2014 were recovered quickly and first moved to a research center at Seoul's Gimpo International Airport for analysis. On Wednesday, however, the country's deputy minister for civil aviation, Joo Jong-wan, said the flight data recorder had \"been deemed unrecoverable for data extraction domestically,\" so it was being sent to the U.S. for analysis in collaboration with the NTSB.",
      "Joo said earlier that \"the initial extraction has already been completed\" for the cockpit voice recorder.",
      "\"Based on this preliminary data, we plan to start converting it into audio format,\" he told journalists, meaning investigators will likely soon be able to hear the pilots' communications during the ill-fated flight.",
      "\"I think the cockpit voice recorder, if they're able to read that out, that will be key to unlocking this mystery,\" Robert Sumwalt, former chair of the NTSB, told CBS News.",
      "Jeju Air said the crash was not due to \"any maintenance issues,\" according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas told BBC News that South Korea's airlines were broadly deemed to follow \"industry best practice\" and that both the plane and Jeju Air had an \"excellent safety record.\"",
      "South Korean plane skidded into a fence shielding antennas",
      "Transport Ministry officials said Monday that they would examine whether the fence the plane hit \u2014 a concrete structure which housed a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. They said they were also trying to establish whether there were any communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot.",
      "The positioning of the localizer antennas close to the end of the runway behind unforgiving fortifications will likely be a focus for investigators.",
      "\"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall,\" Christian Beckert, a flight safety expert and pilot for German carrier Lufthansa told the Reuters news agency. \"You more [often] have maybe an engineered material arresting system, which lets the airplane sink into the ground a little bit\" to slow it down.",
      "Could a bird strike have caused the Jeju Air disaster?",
      "Lee Jeong-hyun, the chief of the local Muan fire department, said Sunday that a bird strike and bad weather could have contributed to the crash, but he stressed that the cause was still under investigation.",
      "According to CBS News partner network BBC News, one passenger on the flight had messaged a relative before the disaster and said a bird \"was stuck in the wing\" and that it couldn't land, but officials have not yet confirmed whether there was any bird strike.",
      "Geoffrey Thomas, the expert cited by BBC and the editor of Airline News, told Reuters separately that he was skeptical a bird strike alone could have caused the deadly crash.",
      "\"A bird strike is not unusual. Problems with an undercarriage are not unusual. Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" he said.",
      "Why wasn't the landing gear deployed?",
      "It remained unclear what, if any, engine or systems failures the flight crew might have been contending with in the last few minutes of the ill-fated flight. Experts have said video of the crash showed no apparent movement of the plane's flaps as it came down, which can help slow an aircraft, suggesting there could have been a loss of hydraulic pressure that controls the mechanical devices.",
      "The hydraulic control systems operate independently, and experts said an engine problem would be unlikely to affect their operation.",
      "The aircraft also has a manual override for pilots to lower landing gear in the event of an electronic or mechanical failure. It was unclear if the Jeju Air crew simply didn't have time to lower the nose wheels manually, or if some other factor could have prevented them from doing so.",
      "Sumwalt, the former NTSB chair, told CBS News, \"I flew 737s for 10 years as a captain, and I can say that the landing gear can be manually deployed, so the real question will be, what set up the sequence of events here? Did the bird strike set up the sequence of events where the crew got rushed and did not deploy the landing gear? I doubt that there was any sort of a malfunction with the gear, given that it can be deployed manually and through the normal means.\"",
      "A long, hard year for U.S. aviation giant Boeing",
      "The crash wrapped up a troubling 2024 for U.S. aviation giant Boeing, which has grappled with safety problems, a machinists strike and plunging stock prices.",
      "Experts say the 737-800 aircraft is a more proven model than the company's much-maligned 737 Max jetliners, which were linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "\"I think it's very important to separate this crash ... from the issues that Boeing has had over the recent past,\" Sumwalt said. \"This airplane is 15 years old, so it was probably not a manufacturing issue if the airplane is that old and flew thousands of hours. It's not a design issue. So I don't think that Boeing is going to take a direct hit because of this one.\"",
      "Still, South Korean authorities said they'll conduct safety inspections on all the 737-800s operated by domestic airlines, including 39 by Jeju Air.",

      "A rare collection of ancient coins was discovered last week by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins are more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty that presided over Judea in the final centuries leading up to the common era, according to the University of Haifa in Israel.",
      "Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during ongoing excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan. The project is headed by researchers at the University of Haifa and the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, the university\u00a0said in a news release translated from Hebrew.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed Friday, coinciding with the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "Each coin bears inscriptions that include an eight-pointed star and the phrase \"King Alexander 25\" written in Aramaic, one of the world's oldest known languages that originated in the region around what's now Syria and is closely related to both Arabic and Hebrew. These types of coins date back to about 80 B.C.E., according to the University of Haifa.",
      "\"The site where the treasure was discovered is, apparently, a way station, which had not been recognized in research until now,\" said Shai Bar, one of the leaders of the excavation, in a statement to the university. Bar said the station included a purification bath, used for religious ritual, and a water storage area in addition to other buildings. It's located along a main road leading to the Alexandrion fortress, built atop a mountain in the Jordan Valley by Alexander Jannaeus.",
      "Bar told the university that students and volunteers were involved in the dig that uncovered the monarch's ancient coins. He said they were particularly excited to find the trove during Hanukkah.",
      "\"This added special meaning to the holiday for them, including in the difficult days our people are going through at the moment,\" Bar said. \"I hope that the place will become a site that attracts a crowd, and will be added to the archaeological and heritage sites of our country.\"",

      "Where does the tradition of eating 12 grapes come from?",
      "The origins of the \"uvas de la suerte\" tradition\u00a0are hard to trace. The idea might have begun with grape farmers in Alicante, Spain, to unload a surplus in the early 1900s, reported Atlas Obscura. Grapes are a reasonably priced crop that tends to fare well, and there are often surpluses so the fruit can be brought cheaply.",
      "Or it might have been Madrid's bourgeoisie copying the French tradition of having grapes and champagne on the last day of the year, NPR reported. But the story goes that the Madrid residents wanted to rebel against class distinctions and decided to mock aristocrats by going to Puerta del Sol to eat grapes accompanied by the sound of the bells.",
      "Whatever the beginnings were, the tradition has caught on like wildfire in Spain. Supermarket chains such as Mercadona and Super Sol advertise and sell \"uvas de la suerte\" across Spain.",
      "Mercadona, one of Spain's largest grocery chains, advertised four ways to purchase grapes for the occasion. Natural bunch grapes with seeds from Alicante add \"an element of fun to the tradition of the 12 grapes.\" The seeds provide a \"crunchy touch,\" the supermarket said. Consumers can also buy grapes without seeds, or prepackaged grapes \"specially selected and packaged with the exact amount needed for each chime.\"",
      "Prepackaged grapes allow revelers to open the grapes at the precise moment the clock changes and not worry about counting or peeling the grapes in the midst of the excitement of the celebration.",
      "Grapes can also be bought peeled and pitted in a can. These grapes are among the most popular for Spaniards due to their convenience, the supermarket said.",
      "What are the exact rules for the New Year's grape tradition?",
      "Regardless of how the grapes are purchased, eating them at midnight on Nochevieja is key to celebrating\u00a0in Spain. Celebrants need to eat the grapes before the clock chimes 12:01 a.m., and if consumed in full, tradition holds that good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",

      "In the past, drug cartels in Mexico have often handed out gifts or bags of food to local people around the holidays, to try to improve their image or build local support. The cartels often want local people to warn them of army raids, but at the same time the gangs usually extort protection money from local residents.",

      "Yoon's powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which drew hundreds of troops and police officers into Seoul streets.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has called \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government's budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants. He's ignored repeated requests by investigative authorities to appear for questioning, and the presidential security service has blocked attempts to search his office and residence citing a law that bans raids on sites with state secrets.",
      "A lawyer for Yoon rejected the anti-corruption agency's request for warrants on Monday, arguing it lacked legal authority to investigate rebellion charges.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on how to proceed with the warrants.",
      "\"Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\" said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \"Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\"",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon's residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",

      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon's imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon's deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn't trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim. Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \"quickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\" Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon's orders.",
      "The country's political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the Constitutional Court.

    "title": "Suspect in Christmas market attack has signs of mental illness, official says",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 14:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Germany's interior minister said the man charged in the deadly attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg had \"striking signs of a pathological psyche.\"",
    "story": [
      "The German government, under fire for failing to prevent a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market, said Monday that the tragedy would have been hard to prevent and said that the suspect appeared to be mentally disturbed.",
      "Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, along with security and intelligence chiefs, faced questioning by a parliamentary committee about the attack and on whether there had been missed clues and security lapses. Five people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Dec. 20 attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg.",
      "Faeser said no motive had yet been established but \"there are striking signs of a pathological psyche\" in the suspect, a Saudi-born doctor who had lived in Germany for years.",
      "She added that lessons must be learned about how to track potential attackers who don't fit conventional threat categories and who \"are psychologically disturbed and... driven by confused conspiracy theories.\"",
      "The minister argued that \"such attackers do not fit any threat profile\" \u2014 such as far-right extremist or Islamist \u2014 and warned that German security services will need \"other indicators and action plans\" to deal with them in future.",
      "The suspect, referred to as Taleb A. by German officials, has been identified by BBC News and the AFP news agency as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen. He came to Germany in 2006 and was granted refugee status 10 years later.",
      "Police arrested him at the scene of the attack in which a motor vehicle was used as a weapon \u2014 a method previously used in jihadist attacks.",
      "In 2016, an Islamic extremist\u00a0plowed through a crowded Christmas market in Berlin\u00a0with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker was killed in a shootout days later. That same year, ISIS claimed responsibility after another attacker killed 86 people in a truck rampage in the\u00a0French city of Nice.",
      "Abdulmohsen, by contrast, has in the past voiced strongly anti-Islam views and sympathies with the far right in his social media posts, as well as anger at Germany for allowing in too many Muslim war refugees and other asylum-seekers.",
      "Faeser said there were \"tens of thousands of tweets\" the suspect had posted over the years that were yet to be fully examined.",
      "\"That explains why not everything is on the table yet,\" she said. \"Who knew about which clues and what was passed on when must be carefully clarified.\"",
      "Reuters reported that he posted rambling commentary on X, among other things blaming Germany's supposed liberalism for the death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, and accusing police of stealing a USB stick from him and destroying a criminal complaint he had filed.",
      "Abdulmohsen, 50, is the only suspect in the attack in which a rented BMW sport utility vehicle plowed through the crowd of revelers at high speed, leaving a bloody trail of carnage.",
      "He has been remanded in custody on five counts of murder and 205 counts of attempted murder, prosecutors said, but so far not on terrorism-related charges.",
      "The state premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, described it at the time as \"a lone attack.\"",
      "According to media reports citing unnamed German security sources, the suspect had in the past been treated for mental illness and tested positive for drug use on the night of his arrest. German media investigations of Abdulmohsen's past and his social media postings have found expressions of anger and frustration, and threats of violence against German citizens and politicians.",
      "German police have said they had contacted Abdulmohsen in September 2023 and October 2024, and then repeatedly tried but failed to meet with him again in December.",
      "According to Reuters, Holger Muench, president of the federal criminal police office (BKA), said Abdulmohsen \"made insults and even threats. But he was not known for acts of violence.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who faces a general election in February, told the news site T-online that officials would \"examine very carefully whether there were any failings on the part of the authorities\" and whether any clues were missed in the run-up to the attack.",
      "Saudi Arabia said it had repeatedly warned Germany about Abdulmohsen, but according to Reuters, police said they found the accusations too vague.",
      "Ahead of February's election, the Christmas market bloodshed has reignited heated debate about immigration and security, after deadly knife attacks this year blamed on Islamist extremists.",
      "After Monday's hearing, lawmaker Konstantin Kuhle of the liberal Free Democrats said \"the federal and state authorities knew this perpetrator.\" But Kuhle said no authority had connected all the dots and that \"we do not have a complete list of all contacts with the authorities as of today.\"",
      "Faeser said that having a fuller picture of all the data would have been good but would likely \"not have prevented\" the attack.",
      "Lawmaker Gottfried Curio of the far-right and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party was most scathing in his criticism.",
      "\"Everything was foreseeable for everyone,\" he charged. \"We have hundreds of dangerous people in this country, we let them run around.",
      "\"What we need are deportations, instead we get naturalisations. What is needed now is a change in security policy in this country.\"",

Let's define an outcome, something that the government really needs, and let private industry compete for that,\" Rozanski said.",
      "Federal agencies are responsible for negotiating the best deal for the government, but contractors have a history of overcharging. In 2014, a Defense Department Inspector General report showed that the agency was charged as much as 831% for spare parts. Another more recent audit found a 7,943% markup on a soap dispenser sold to the Air Force.",

The Speakership remained vacant \u2013 and thus, the House frozen \u2013 for 22 days after Republicans dumped McCarthy nine months later. House Republicans then tapped House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., for Speaker. Scalise withdrew his name before there was even a floor vote. House GOPers then tapped Rep.

They didn\u2019t like that he allowed a bill on the floor to aid Ukraine. They opposed him doing yet another interim spending bill in September. They really didn\u2019t like how he worked with Democrats on major, must-do pieces of legislation. And then there was the misstep of the staggering, 1,500-page interim spending package which Mr. Trump and Elon Musk pulverized from afar in December. Johnson then did President-elect Trump\u2019s bidding with another spending package \u2013 which included a debt ceiling increase. But 38 House Republicans bolted on that bill.",
      "So Johnson\u2019s tenure has been bumpy. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s on the hook come Friday afternoon during the vote for Speaker. Everyone on Capitol Hill is on tenterhooks when it comes to wrapping this up expeditiously.",

There should be one vacancy. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., resigned in the fall \u2013 and said he did not \"intend\" to serve in the new Congress, despite having won reelection.",

Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., Dwight Evans, D-Penn., and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will likely be there. But the Speaker\u2019s election is about the math.

      "Roberts explained his concerns in his annual report on the federal judiciary.",
      "\"It is not in the nature of judicial work to make everyone happy. Most cases have a winner and a loser. Every Administration suffers defeats in the court system \u2014 sometimes in cases with major ramifications for executive or legislative power or other consequential topics,\" Robert wrote in the 15-page report. \"Nevertheless, for the past several decades, the decisions of the courts, popular or not, have been followed, and the Nation has avoided the standoffs that plagued the 1950s and 1960s.\"",
      "\"Within the past few years, however, elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,\" Roberts said, without naming Trump, President Biden or any specific lawmaker. \"These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected. Judicial independence is worth preserving. As my late colleague Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote, an independent judiciary is \u2018essential to the rule of law in any land,\u2019 yet it \u2018is vulnerable to assault; it can be shattered if the society law exists to serve does not take care to assure its preservation.\u2019\"",

      "In the annual report, the chief justice wrote generally that even if court decisions are unpopular or mark a defeat for a presidential administration, other branches of government must be willing to enforce them to ensure the rule of law. Roberts pointed to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that desegrated schools in 1954 as one that needed federal enforcement in the face of resistance from southern governors.",

      "The year kicked off with President Biden in the driver\u2019s seat of the Democratic Party as he keyed up a re-election effort in what was shaping up to be a second matchup against now-President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "In February, however, Biden\u2019s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander-in-chief\u2019s mental fitness. Special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"",
      "The report renewed scrutiny over Biden\u2019s mental acuity, which rose to a fever pitch in June after the president\u2019s first and only presidential debate against Trump.",
      "Biden faced backlash for a handful of gaffes and miscues in the days leading up to his debate against Trump, including former President Obama taking Biden\u2019s wrist and appearing to lead him off a stage during a swank fundraiser, and also abroad when Italian Prime Minister Giogia Meloni guided Biden back to a group of world leaders when he appeared to wander off to give a thumbs-up to a parachutist during the G-7 summit.",
      "When the big debate day arrived, Biden missed his marks repeatedly, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared up against Trump. The disastrous debate performance led to an outpouring of both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to bow out of the race in favor of a younger generation.",

      "Harris soon launched her truncated campaign, flanked by staffers from the Obama administration and campaigns and also a handful of holdovers from Biden\u2019s campaign.",
      "Harris earned the nomination of the party despite not running in the primaries, sparking some calls, including from Democrats, that the process was \"undemocratic.\" High-profile Democrats from the Obamas to the Clintons threw their support behind Harris, while former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Harris' nomination was fair by arguing the nomination process was \"open\" and Harris \"won it.\"",

Despite initial speculation the RNC would be upended by the attempt, Trump appeared throughout the week with a patch over his injured right ear before formally accepting the nomination in a speech.",

We would not be together,\" Trump said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.",
      "\"Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory,\" Trump continued. \"Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassin\u2019s life, took him out.\"",

    "summary": "As competition in the new space race ramps up with China, the United States is preparing to deorbit the International Space Station. If a replacement is not ready by 2028, China may become the leader in space.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Bret Baier has the latest on concerns over the retirement of the International Space Station on 'Special Report.'",
      "Before the International Space Station was launched into orbit in 1998, the U.S. signed a document with several other countries to agree to the peaceful use of the orbital laboratory. The agreement included Russia, Japan, Canada and 11 European countries. China was left out of the plan.",
      "Nearly a decade later, China expressed interest in joining those on board the space station. The European Space Agency signaled support for the addition, along with South Korea. The final decision was ultimately opposed by the United States.",
      "\"I think you'll have to understand that Congress gave us very clear direction in 2011,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said. \"Any bilateral cooperation with China had to be certified as not sharing any information that would give China some kind of an advantage.\"",
      "In 2011, Congress included in a spending bill direction to prohibit collaboration between NASA and China when it comes to some scientific research, including in space. Lawmakers argued China\u2019s program was secretive and too closely tied to its military.",
      "NASA FINALIZES STRATEGY FOR HUMAN PRESENCE IN SPACE",
      "China has become a new threat, setting up a new space race. (Starlab)",
      "\"I think there's no question they're an economic competitor and they're also a competitor for leadership geopolitically,\" Melroy said.",
      "China began developing its own space station. It launched and deorbited a pair of short-term space labs between 2011 and 2018. It launched the first part of its Tiangong Space Station, which translates to Heavenly Palace, in 2011.",
      "\"We're laser-focused on China now. China is a threat. We're in a new space race,\" said President of International and Space Stations at Voyager Space Jeffrey Manber.",
      "Voyager is one of three companies contracted by NASA that is working to develop a new space station. Voyager says it is on pace to launch its Starlab in 2028. There are some fears that NASA will face funding cuts. If there are delays for the companies designing the next space stations, NASA will deorbit the space station without a replacement ready to go.",
      "Melroy insists the agency will not let China be the sole operator of a space station in orbit, but the storyline resonates with that of the space shuttle program.",
      "The American-made space shuttle was the world\u2019s first reusable aircraft. It launched like a rocket and landed like an airplane. In 2004, then-President George W. Bush announced a new space initiative, which included retiring the shuttle by 2010 and conducting the first manned mission on a new spacecraft no later than 2014.",
      "NASA FINALIZES STRATEGY FOR HUMAN PRESENCE IN SPACE",
      "\"The Crew Exploration Vehicle will be capable of ferrying astronauts and scientists to the space station after the shuttle is retired,\" Bush said in 2004.",
      "The government considered several contractors to develop the vehicle under the constellation program. Over the next several years, program delays and funding issues led the Obama administration to eliminate the program from its 2011 budget.",
      "\"Pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy. In part, this is because the old strategy, including the Constellation program, was not fulfilling its promise in many ways,\" then-President Barack Obama said in April 2010.",
      "The administration instead directed more than $6 billion to support commercial companies building spacecraft. The shuttle program came to an end a year later. American-made rockets were still not yet available. The U.S. was forced to rely on Russia for continued space travel.",
      "\"It was tough times. I think it was the right decision. The shuttle's time had come to an end. We needed to make a strategic investment in our own industry to develop the capability to take humans to space,\" Melroy said. \"There were a lot of people who thought we'd canceled the space program.\"",
      "NASA would finally launch an American-made rocket that could carry humans to the space station, nine years after the shuttle\u2019s retirement. It was a delay of six years from Bush\u2019s initial projection. The 2020 SpaceX launch also marked the first of a commercial rocket on U.S. soil.",

      "\"I think it's different in the sense that we are still the leader. We intend to remain the leader. We intend to remain the partner of choice. We work very well with our international partners, and they want to continue to work with us,\" Melroy said.",
      "Only Chinese Taikonauts have visited the Tiangong Space Station. The country has expressed openness to hosting astronauts from other countries. Beijing has increased cooperation with Sweden, Russia and Italy. In recent months, China\u2019s first International Payload launched on a Chinese commercial rocket. It included Oman\u2019s first satellite, which is equipped with artificial intelligence for urban planning, forestry monitoring and disaster management.",
      "If China becomes the only permanent presence in space, international partners could be forced to rely on Taikonauts for long-term needs in low Earth orbit. Commercial companies could also be forced to do the same.",
      "\"We do have to be somewhat careful about technology transfer and how do we actually connect with international firms to make sure that we're not sort of giving away things associated with it,\" Arkisys CEO Dave Barnhart said.",
      "California-based Arkisys is working on a robotic servicing port for companies to use while in orbit.",
      "\"We can provide either the cargo, the supplies, the robotic manipulation capability, the fuel, whatever's required to support a servicing architecture,\" Barnhart said.",
      "Barnhart added the port could help keep the U.S. competitive in space if a commercial station is not ready to go when the space station is decommissioned. While the port would be robotic and not have humans onboard, it would still give the U.S. a form of permanent presence.",

      "Kathy S. recently reached out with a concern many of us can relate to: \"I have received calls from Beijing and Russia on my cellphone. I did not answer them. Can you tell me why this is happening? Is my phone at risk?\"",

      "The rise of international call scams",
      "International call scams have become increasingly common in recent years. One particularly prevalent scam is known as \"Wangiri,\" which originates from Japan and means \"one-ring-and-cut.\" These scammers typically let your phone ring once or twice before hanging up, hoping to pique your curiosity and prompt a callback.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Why are you receiving these international scam calls?",
      "There are several reasons why you might be receiving calls from unfamiliar international numbers.",
      "Wangiri scam: Scammers use automated systems to call thousands of numbers, disconnecting after one ring. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate number, incurring significant charges.",

      "Is your phone at risk?",
      "While receiving unexpected international calls doesn't necessarily put your phone at immediate risk, there are several potential dangers to be aware of.\u00a0The primary risk lies in potential financial losses if you engage with these scammers. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1) Encrypting your internet connection: This makes it extremely difficult for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to intercept and read your data.",
      "2) Masking your IP address: By hiding your real IP address, a VPN allows you to browse the internet anonymously, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your online activities.",

Using a\u00a0VPN service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Antivirus protects your device: It guards against threats that could compromise your device's security, regardless of how they reach your system. Therefore, it's important to have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover.",
      "Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what\u2019s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you\u2019re not home.",
      "But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose a privacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data.",

      "Smart outdoor camera\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How smart home cameras can be spying on you",
      "According to a\u00a0study conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That\u2019s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What\u2019s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity.",
      "Indoor security camera apps are slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",

      "The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers.

      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",
      "2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:\u00a0Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It\u2019s important to regularly review the app\u2019s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",
      "3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Make sure your camera\u2019s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",
      "Disable location tracking: The security company may use location data for features like geofencing, which triggers actions based on your proximity to your home. If you're concerned about privacy, you can disable location tracking in the app to prevent the system from collecting this data.Limit video storage: Many security company\u2019s cameras can store video footage in the cloud, but you can adjust the app settings to limit how long footage is stored or to delete it automatically after a certain period.Adjust device permissions: Review and adjust permissions for devices like cameras and smart locks to limit data collection. For example, disable audio recording if it's not necessary for your security needs.Control third-party data sharing: Your security company may share data with third parties, so it's essential to check and disable any settings that allow your data to be shared beyond your security system\u2019s ecosystem.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 08:00:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) allows computer and smartphone users to mask an IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between a device and the internet.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that allows you to mask your IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This means you can browse the web more privately, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Another use case for VPNs is accessing sites that are blocked in your region. For example, you could be sitting in New York and accessing content on Chinese social media platforms (though I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing that). However, a VPN can sometimes have the opposite effect, blocking you from accessing content that you were otherwise able to view.",
      "I recently received an email from Carol in Douglasville, Georgia, who asked:",
      "\"Why am I blocked from seeing a site when I use a VPN? I am being blocked from answering emails I receive from the VA, Social Security and government sites that I need to connect to concerning my benefits.\"",
      "She says she attempted changing servers and even switched to different cities within the U.S., but she still couldn\u2019t access the sites. Carol, that sounds like a serious issue. Understandably, you would want to use a VPN when visiting websites, and not being able to access them can be quite frustrating. This situation may even force you to disable your VPN, which could put you at risk. Below, I\u2019ll discuss why this happens and how you can work around the issue.",

      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A\u00a0virtual private network (VPN) is a secure connection method used to add privacy and security to private and public networks, like the internet and Wi-Fi hotspots. VPNs are often used to protect sensitive data and to ensure that online activities are safe from cyber threats. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online identity, a VPN provides anonymity and protects against hackers, snoopers and data breaches. It also allows you to access content that may be restricted based on your geographic location, making it a great tool for boosting your online privacy and freedom.\u00a0Here are 10 reasons you need a VPN at home.",
      "Why are you not able to access certain websites when using a VPN?",
      "Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn\u2019t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often use VPN detection tools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see.",
      "But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn\u2019t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you\u2019re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through.",
      "Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users.",

      "6 ways to bypass VPN blockers",
      "If you're having trouble accessing certain sites with your VPN on, try the steps below. Start from the first step and keep going until the issue is resolved.",
      "Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN",
      "If one server isn\u2019t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn\u2019t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites.",
      "To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others.",
      "If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions.",
      "For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary.",
      "WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?",
      "If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN.",
      "Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn\u2019t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection.",
      "If all else fails, switch to a mobile data connection or a different network. Sometimes, the issue is with your current ISP (internet service provider) rather than the VPN.",
      "30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE\u2019S WHY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "VPNs are great for getting around restrictions, but some websites have blockers to stop VPN traffic. There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You\u2019ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service. They keep an eye on their servers to make sure everything\u2019s running smoothly and offer extra features like dedicated IP addresses.",

      "Authorities say the truck contained gasoline and camp fuel containers, as well as large firework mortars. Video of the incident captures the truck exploding in a ball of fire, and fireworks can also be seen going off in all directions. A bystander can also be seen just feet from the truck as it goes up in flames.",
      "An Army spokesperson told Fox News that Livelsberger began active duty in the Army in January 2006 and reached the rank of master sergeant. Livelsberger spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to the Army Special Forces Command.",

Before that, a house in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, is listed, and before that, an apartment in Colorado Springs, Colorado. FBI Denver posted to X on Thursday that they are at a home in Colorado Springs and will remain there for several hours. The investigation is related to the Las Vegas explosion.",

They served at the same base but at different times.",
      "More than 50,000 U.S. service members are currently stationed at Fort Liberty.",

      "Meanwhile, McMahill said that the Cybertruck withstood most of the explosion on Wednesday and was still completely intact afterward.",
      "\"The fact that this was a Cybertruck, really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet because it had most of the blast go up through the truck and out,\" McMahill said. \"In fact, if you look on that video, you\u2019ll see that the front glass doors at the Trump hotel were not even broken by the blast.\"",
      "The preliminary investigation to this point involved input from\u00a0Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who McMahill said gave quite a bit of information about how the vehicle was locked after it exploded because of the force of the explosion.",

It was an apparent attempt to divert forces from eastern Ukraine to the Kremlin\u2019s home turf and give it a bargaining chip when the time comes for peace negotiations.",
      "The campaign was the largest attack on Russia since World War II, and by mid-October the Pentagon had confirmed that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia, with some 11,000 North Korean soldiers believed to be fighting Ukraine in Kursk, the first foreign nation to send in troops since the war began.",

But North Korea is also reported to have endured heavy losses, with Zelenskyy claiming this week that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed in the fighting while others face extreme logistical shortages, including access to clean water, the Associated Press reported.",

      "North Korea\u2019s deployment of troops to Russia reportedly prompted South Korea to consider escalating its non-lethal aid by mulling over a supply of missiles.

Prisoners were often starved, beaten and tortured with electricity. \"When they execute someone, they don\u2019t feed them for three days before the execution. The guards say, \u2018Why feed him? We will take the food for ourselves.\u2019 Imagine someone about to die, and they are starved first, denied even the dignity of a last meal,\" Al Hendi said.",

      "Investigators, civilians and rebels search through Sednaya Prison, hoping to uncover hidden compartments where detainees might still be held. Outside, hundreds of families anxiously wait for news of their missing or disappeared loved ones, clinging to the hope of a reunion. Sednaya, the infamous \"human slaughterhouse\" outside Damascus, was where thousands of regime opponents had been locked up, tortured and killed from the earliest days of the 2011 uprising to the long brutal years of civil war.

      "The atrocities committed at Sednaya were part of a broader campaign by the Assad regime to exterminate its opposition in the most horrific ways. Both Braude and Al Hendi emphasize the need for accountability. \"What we need now is truth and reconciliation,\" Braude says. \"Only by acknowledging the suffering and recognizing the full scope of the atrocities can Syria begin to heal. If we don\u2019t do that, we risk perpetuating cycles of vengeance.\"",
      "After the fall of the Assad regime earlier this month, Sednaya was liberated, and thousands of prisoners were freed. \"The prisoners who emerged from Sednaya were traumatized, many of them unable to even remember their own names,\" Al Hendi said. \"They had been detained for so long they didn\u2019t even know that Assad\u2019s father had died. They thought Assad was still in power.\"",

He emphasized the urgent need to preserve this evidence, warning, \"Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold. Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.\"",
      "The investigations into Sednaya and the mass graves have painted a horrific picture of the regime\u2019s violence, but they also serve as a call for justice, Braude said. \"The consequences of the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities are profound. The key question now is how the population can move forward and rebuild, rather than descending into further civil conflict. There is a fear of cycles of vengeance, but true reconciliation can only come through truth and acknowledgment.\"",
      "He said that \"99% of Syria\u2019s prison guards belong to the Alawi community.\" \"We\u2019re talking about half the young population of the Alawi sect, as most of them work in the army or secret police. The rebels have proposed a solution: Russia will surrender Assad and 100 top officials responsible for the atrocities. In return, rebels would offer amnesty to low-level perpetrators who were following orders. If Russia facilitates this, it could help prevent further violence and bring stability to Syria.\"",

      "The death toll for what amounted to be South Korea's most fatal plane crash in decades stands at 179 people on Monday, a day after the disaster gripped the nation already in intense political turmoil.",
      "The United States is now sending investigators to help determine what caused the Jeju Air plane to crash-land at Muan airport and slam into a concrete barrier on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, South Korean officials are combing through more than 600 body parts, and the stench of blood remains in the air at the crash site, the Daily Mail reported.",

      "Doctors at Mokpo Korean Hospital reportedly described how Lee, who suffered a fractured left shoulder and head injuries but remained conscious, repeatedly asked them \"What happened?\" and \"Why am I here?\"\"It seems she was in a near-panic state, possibly worried about the safety of the plane and passengers,\" one hospital official told the Korean Times.",

Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "\"The NTSB is leading a team of U.S. investigators (NTSB, Boeing and FAA) to assist the Republic of Korea\u2019s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) with their investigation of the Dec. 29 Jeju Air accident at Muan International Airport in Muan, Republic of Korea,\" the NTSB Newsroom account wrote on X.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country\u2019s aircraft operation systems.",

Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",

Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",

      "Ministry officials said Monday the plane\u2019s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida, told the AP.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said. Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They told the AP there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",

He urged that Congress get on board with the incoming Trump administration to reallocate resources within the Pentagon to better prioritize naval strength, nuclear deterrence, missile defense, and logistics.",
      "\"China is engaging in an unprecedented military build-up that the world frankly hasn't seen since Adolf Hitler in the 1930s,\" DeVore, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, told \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\"",

      "\"They're massively building up their nuclear arsenal. We expect it to expand to at least 1,000 warheads by 2030, only five years from now.

As far as the report discloses, the DoD says China has added 300 medium-range ballistic missiles and 100 long-range cruise missiles. Their arsenal also now includes more than 600 operational nuclear warheads and is expected to have more than 1,000 by 2030.",

      "Federal investigators identified Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, as the man who intentionally rammed a rented pickup into revelers around 3:15 a.m. on Bourbon Street as people were ringing in the new year.",
      "He died in a shootout with police. Two officers were shot and were stable, officials said.",
      "Follow here for live updates",
      "Federal and local officials are working to uncover a motive behind the attack and determine whether Jabbar acted alone or had help.",
      "\u201cThis is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,\u201d Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said.",
      "The carnage unfolded when Jabbar drove onto a sidewalk, bypassing a police vehicle that had been parked to block cars from pedestrians celebrating on crowded Bourbon Street, officials told reporters Wednesday afternoon.",
      "According to preliminary information, Jabbar had a black ISIS flag affixed to the hitch of the Ford F-150 Lightning truck.",
      "The car-sharing marketplace Turo said the vehicle was rented from its company.",
      "In an address to the nation, President Joe Biden said Jabbar posted videos to social media \u201cindicating he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ISIS flag was found in his vehicle,\u201d Biden said, citing information from the FBI. He added that no one should jump to conclusions about the investigation.",
      "CNN, citing two officials briefed on the investigation, reported that law enforcement is reviewing videos made by Jabbar while he drove to Louisiana in which he discussed his allegiance to ISIS. NBC News\u00a0hasn\u2019t\u00a0independently verified that reporting.",
      "Federal officials and local law enforcement agencies in New Orleans are investigating whether Jabbar used a long-gun rifle and fired it into the crowd as he ran people over, three senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told NBC News.",
      "The incident is being investigated as both a terrorist attack and a crime scene, federal and local officials said.",
      "\u201cWe will be relentless, and we will do everything that it takes to render real justice,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference.",
      "The FBI, which is leading the investigation, said weapons and potential improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were in Jabbar\u2019s car and in the French Quarter.",
      "Officials are looking into at least two IEDs that may have been planted near the attack area to determine whether those were actual explosive devices and whether they were operable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re aggressively running down all of the leads to identify this, the possible subjects, associates. We\u2019re working to ensure that there is no further threat,\u201d Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s New Orleans field office, told reporters.",
      "Jabbar had been working for professional services giant Deloitte in a staff-level role since 2021, the company confirmed to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are shocked to learn of reports ... that the individual identified as a suspect had any association with our firm,\u201d Deloitte managing director Jonathan Gandal said in a statement.",
      "\u201cLike everyone, we are outraged by this shameful and senseless act of violence and are doing all we can to assist authorities in their investigation,\u201d he said. He did not expand on the nature of Jabbar\u2019s work for the company.",
      "Jabbar served in the Army on active duty from 2006 to 2015, then in the Army Reserve from 2015 to 2020, according to three U.S. defense officials.",
      "He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 and was an administrative clerk. He was a staff sergeant in 2020 when he was honorably discharged.",
      "Separately, he tried to enlist in the Navy in 2004 but never shipped out or began training, a spokesperson said.",
      "Texas criminal records show that Jabbar was charged in 2002 with misdemeanor theft and in 2005 with driving with an invalid license.",
      "He attended Georgia State University from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a BBA in computer information systems, a university spokesperson said.",
      "A childhood friend said Jabbar\u2019s alleged actions on Wednesday  don\u2019t at all align with the person he knew growing up in Beaumont, Texas.",
      "\u201cWhat happened today was a complete 180 of anything I ever knew about him,\u201d said Chris Pousson, who last spoke with Jabbar, whom he called \u201cSham,\u201d sometime in 2017 or 2018. \u201cHe was very quiet, very reserved, smart, articulate.\u201d",
      "Pousson said he first met Jabbar in 1996 at Beaumont Middle School.  They became instant friends and later attended the same high school. After graduating, the two lost touch when Jabbar joined the Army and Pousson joined the Air Force.",
      "When they reconnected on Facebook several years later, Pousson noticed Jabbar\u2019s posts focused on his Muslim faith.",
      "\u201cIt was always positive \u2014 peace be with you, uplifting type of stuff,\u201d Pousson said. \u201cNothing that he posted online that I saw was negative.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see this coming from a mile away,\u201d he added.",
      "Civil records show Jabbar was married twice, with his first marriage ending in 2012 and his second in 2022.",
      "In 2020, Jabbar\u2019s second wife filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, according to public records.",
      "The order barred both parties from \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to the other party or to a child of either party\u201d or \u201cthreatening the other party or a child of either party with imminent bodily injury.\u201d",
      "A month later, the divorce case was dismissed, and a new divorce petition was filed in 2021.\u00a0Jabbar and his ex-wife were granted joint custody of their child in 2022.",
      "In a video posted to YouTube in 2020, Jabbar said he was born in Beaumont, Texas, and worked in real estate after having served a decade in the military.",
      "His real estate license expired in 2023, according to Texas Real Estate Commission records.",
      "A woman who identified herself as Jabbar\u2019s sister-in-law and asked not to be named said relatives in Texas were in shock when they heard the news.",
      "It makes \u201cno sense,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s the nicest person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was a good man. He takes care of his children and everything.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An ISIS flag\u00a0allegedly found\u00a0in the\u00a0truck that Shamsud-Din Jabbar used in the lethal car-ramming attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on New Year\u2019s Day\u00a0highlights the persistent danger posed by the terrorist group, which continues to churn out online propaganda to try to foment violence around the world, experts and U.S. officials say.",
      "The Islamic State\u2019s exact role in the attack remains unclear. But the discovery of the flag, as well as\u00a0two possible improvised explosive devices\u00a0in the area, prompted federal authorities to investigate the suspect\u2019s possible links with ISIS, law enforcement officials said.\u00a0President Joe Biden said Wednesday evening that the FBI told him Jabbar had published videos \u201cindicating that he was inspired by ISIS.\u201d",
      "The attack in New Orleans, which killed at least\u00a015\u00a0people, follows repeated warnings from U.S. law enforcement and\u00a0intelligence officials\u00a0about an elevated\u00a0terrorist threat\u00a0over the past year fueled by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s response.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Authorities have cited ISIS\u2019 branch in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-K,\u00a0as a particular danger.",
      "The arrest in October of an Afghan\u00a0accused of plotting an Election Day attack\u00a0in Oklahoma City, as well as recent plots in\u00a0France,\u00a0Sweden\u00a0and elsewhere, highlight the growing threat posed by ISIS-K, officials and counterterrorism experts\u00a0say.",
      "\u201cThe New Orleans terrorist attack simply confirms what many in the counterterrorism community have been saying for the past year, which is that ISIS remains a stubborn and persistent threat and one which simply isn\u2019t going to fade away,\u201d said Colin Clarke of the Soufan Group, a consultancy that focuses on global security issues.",
      "\u201cWhile we don\u2019t know the extent of ISIS involvement yet, this was either inspired by the group or directed from abroad,\u201d Clarke said.",
      "Aaron Zelin, an expert on jihadist groups at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank, said the use of a car to target pedestrians is a typical \u201clow-tech\u201d tactic ISIS extremists have used in previous attacks in the West over the past several years, along with stabbing assaults.",
      "Car ramming doesn\u2019t require access to explosives, specific weapons or a sophisticated plan, Zelin\u00a0noted.",
      "If the New Orleans case is confirmed as an\u00a0ISIS-backed\u00a0or -inspired\u00a0attack, it would be the first lethal assault by\u00a0someone connected to or acting in the name of\u00a0the group on U.S. soil since 2017, when an ISIS supporter\u00a0drove a truck along\u00a0a bike path in New York City, killing eight people.",
      "In November 2016, authorities said, ISIS propaganda inspired a Somali refugee to drive a car into a crowd at Ohio State University and then stab students trying to help those hit by his car. Police shot and killed the attacker.\u00a0From 2014 to fall 2018, there were 16 vehicular attacks in the United States and Europe \u201cconducted by jihadists,\" including but not limited to people inspired by or connected with ISIS,\u00a0according to a report by the think tank New America.",
      "ISIS, a global Sunni Islamist group that once controlled a vast stretch of territory in Iraq and Syria, is weaker than it was at its height 10 years ago. Western intelligence agencies have generally managed to counter the threat posed by the group, Zelin told NBC News. \u201cOverall, most of the attack plots have been broken up\u201d in the West, he said.",
      "\u201cBut it only takes one occasion for something to happen, and unfortunately, that then leads people to view the threat differently,\u201d he said.",
      "In early August, the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies helped Austria defeat an ISIS plot to kill hundreds of people at Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Deputy CIA Director David Cohen said\u00a0at the time.\u00a0The shows were called off.",
      "Robust use of online propaganda",
      "Over the past decade, ISIS\u2019 online propaganda has provided guidance to its followers about how to conduct attacks by stabbing people or ramming cars into crowds, Zelin\u00a0said.",
      "\u201cNone of this is new. They just continue to throw it out every single day. And from their perspective, the hope is that it sticks with somebody,\u201d he said.",
      "With branches in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, ISIS has invested heavily in propaganda across multiple languages, often aiming its message at Muslims abroad, experts say.",
      "The group has counseled patience in its efforts to target the United States and other Western countries since it lost its self-declared \u201ccaliphate\u201d territory in Iraq and Syria in 2019, said Lucas\u00a0Webber,\u00a0a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism,\u00a0a\u00a0nongovernmental organization that aims to disrupt extremists\u2019 use of the internet.",
      "Still, Webber said, it\u00a0\u201chas remained highly active online, and a robust official and supporting network of propaganda outlets have flourished across platforms.\u201d",
      "ISIS also has \u201cramped up\u201d its operations in recent months to carry out or guide attacks on its perceived enemies, Webber said.",
      "The\u00a0collapse of the Assad regime\u00a0in Syria last month could open\u00a0a potential strategic opportunity for ISIS as it seeks to exploit a political and security vacuum, experts said.",
      "\u201cWith ISIS gaining ground in Syria, there is a high likelihood that the group will ramp up its propaganda in an effort to inspire followers, fanboys and extremists around the globe,\u201d said Clarke of the Soufan Group. \u201cISIS is looking to seize the momentum heading into 2025 and will likely increase its operational tempo, including a focus on attacks in the West.\u201d",
      "At its peak in 2015, ISIS controlled a vast swath of territory in Syria and Iraq, which it used to stage attacks in the region and abroad.",
      "A U.S.-led military campaign,\u00a0which relied on American air power, Kurdish ground forces and Iraqi government troops,\u00a0inflicted major losses on ISIS and\u00a0eventually rolled back the group.",
      "In its annual assessment of global threats last year, the U.S. intelligence community said, \u201cISIS will remain a centralized global organization even as it has been forced to rely on regional branches.\u201d",
      "It added that the group will try \u201cto conduct and inspire global attacks against the West and Western interests.\u201d"

      "Security barriers in New Orleans that were intended to protect pedestrians from vehicles but at times malfunctioned were removed for replacement before an attacker drove a pickup truck into a crowd along Bourbon Street on Wednesday morning, killing at least 15 people and injuring dozens more.",
      "City officials said other barriers, vehicles and law enforcement officers deployed strategically on Bourbon Street failed to prevent the attacker from driving onto the sidewalk, where he ran into pedestrians at about 3:15 a.m. local time on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "New Orleans was replacing the older barriers, known as bollards, ahead of the city\u2019s hosting the Super Bowl in February, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cBollards were not up because they are near completion, with the expectation of being completed before the Super Bowl,\u201d she said.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said at the news conference that police were aware of the security issue and did \u201charden those target areas where the bollards\u201d previously were with patrol cars and other measures.",
      "\u201cWe did have a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there, and they still got around,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIn this particular case, the terrorist just went all the way around up onto the sidewalk,\u201d she said.",
      "Video of the attack appeared to show the driver turning right off Canal Street and onto Bourbon Street, stopping just before Conti Street.",
      "\u201cWe did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.",
      "The FBI is investigating the attack \u2014\u00a0in which a gunman drove through the crowd and then exchanged fire with police, wounding two officers before he was killed \u2014\u00a0as an act of terrorism. Authorities have found potential explosive devices and believe the attacker did not act alone, the FBI said.",
      "Asked about the security measures at Wednesday afternoon's news conference, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said: \u201cWe recognize we\u2019ve got a problem. We\u2019re going to fix it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is going to be a top priority as we go into the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras, and the solution that we\u2019re going to come up with is going to be a permanent one,\u201d he said.",
      "A witness, Jimmy Cothran, told NBC News that he had been surprised to see that the metal barricades that usually block off Bourbon Street were not deployed on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cThey weren\u2019t up, so you still kind of had to watch your back for cars,\u201d he said.",
      "The bollards were placed on Bourbon Street several years ago to guard against an attack like the one in Nice, France, in 2016, which killed more than 80 people when a truck plowed through a crowd of pedestrians. But the bollards soon malfunctioned, clogged with Mardi Gras beads, and the police found them inefficient, Cantrell said at the news conference.",
      "Hosting the Super Bowl gave the city \u201can opportunity to go further and deeper with infrastructure improvements,\u201d including replacing the bollards, she said.",
      "An engineer who worked on the bollard replacement project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team was not authorized to speak publicly, said there was \u201ca mad dash to rush this job\u201d so it could be done in time for the Super Bowl.",
      "The engineer said that when the bollards were originally installed several years ago, hydraulic roadblocks were added during construction to ensure Bourbon Street remained protected. This time, the engineer did not see those types of barriers; instead, there were simpler ones like orange traffic drums, the engineer said.",
      "The city Public Works Department, which is overseeing the bollard replacement project, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.",
      "The city said on its website that the bollards on Bourbon Street from Canal Street to St. Ann Street would be replaced with \u201cnew removable stainless-steel bollards\u201d that could be securely locked behind each crosswalk.",
      "The construction began in November with the removal of the old bollards, and then the replacement proceeded in phases, the city said. It was expected to be finished in February.",
      "New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno told WWL-TV that she and other council members believed the repairs should have been completed further in advance of the Super Bowl. Still, she said, she did not believe the bollards would have prevented the mass killing.",
      "\u201cThis person was ready to inflict pain and death and harm on crowds in Bourbon Street, and I think he would have tried to find whatever way that he could,\u201d Moreno said.",
      "Radi Nabulsi, publisher of the website UGASports.com, told NBC News that just before the New Year's attack, at about 2:30 a.m. local time, he saw a large law enforcement presence in the Bourbon Street area, as well as multiple white and orange plastic barricades and fencing. He said he did not remember seeing the bollards he had seen in the past.",
      "\u201cThe problem is Bourbon Street is long and every block there\u2019s a cross street and there\u2019s not a barricade on each one of those, because cars are going north to south, crossing Bourbon,\u201d he said.",
      "But Nabulsi said he \u201cfelt completely safe\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cOne person, with all the security they put in place, killed 10 people and injured many more, and that is just disheartening,\u201d he said.",
      "Another witness told NBC affiliate WDSU that the attacker's pickup truck \u201cmowed over the barricade.\u201d"

Lights returned to households as well as to Puerto Rico\u2019s hospitals, water plants and sewage facilities after the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems plaguing the island.",

      "The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year.

At the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, in August, over\u00a0half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm.",
      "The New Year\u2019s Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau says."

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 19:37:35 GMT",
    "summary": "New year, same old real estate market: The high mortgage rates, scarce inventory and dismal affordability that have plagued housing look set to linger.",
    "story": [
      "New year, same old real estate market: The high mortgage rates, scarce inventory and dismal affordability that have plagued housing look set to linger into 2025.",
      "There were some signs of improvement late last year. Pending home sales rose for four months in a row through November, boosting hopes that the two-year deep freeze in residential real estate was starting to thaw. Industry experts have said buyers are increasingly adjusting their expectations, deciding they can\u2019t wait for lower mortgage rates to spring for a home.",
      "In some markets, consumers \u201care taking advantage of more available inventory,\u201d National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. \u201cMortgage rates have averaged above 6% for the past 24 months. Buyers are no longer waiting for or expecting mortgage rates to fall substantially.\u201d Particularly in the South, where relatively more homes are available and jobs are plentiful, pending home sales jumped 5.2% in November.",
      "Mortgage rates dipped late last summer ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September interest rate cut, its first in four years. But they\u2019ve remained at decadeslong highs and began marching toward the 7% mark around the end of the year. So it was hardly a surprise that mortgage applications plunged nearly 22% at the end of December. Granted, that\u2019s typically the slowest month for homebuying activity, but with the central bank now signaling caution around the pace of further rate cuts this year, hopes have been shelved that mortgage rates will fall sharply anytime soon.",
      "\u201cWe are no longer having a view that mortgage rates are going to go to the fives next year or even the following,\u201d Robert Reffkin, the CEO of real estate company Compass, told CNBC last month. \u201cWe believe they will stay around the 6% range for the next two years.\u201d",
      "Broader economic uncertainties are also weighing on the housing market, particularly the inflationary risks of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda. Economists widely agree that tariffs, more tax cuts and restricted immigration threaten to raise consumer prices.",
      "Homebuilders told NBC News last fall, ahead of the election, that Trump\u2019s planned mass deportations of undocumented people would hollow out their immigrant-heavy workforces, slowing construction and driving up prices. But some said they doubted the incoming administration would be able to carry out such a sweeping crackdown.",
      "In the meantime, the bond market is already factoring in some of these policy uncertainties, and because mortgage rates are set by the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, homebuyers holding out for relief may be disappointed. A survey of mortgage lenders last year found that 56% of prospective buyers wanted a mortgage rate between 5.5% and 5.75%, a range that looks well out of reach in the near term.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates are a big factor in the worst home affordability in decades. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta finds affordability for an average-income family is at its worst level since 2006. Many of those who have been getting into the market are stretching their budgets to do so. An NBC News analysis of federal data found in October that about 1 in 4 middle-income new homeowners \u2014 twice as many as a decade before \u2014 are buying into properties whose expenses leave them financially cost-burdened.",
      "\u201cThis persistent increase in prices and interest rates has created a challenging environment for both first-time buyers and those looking to move up the property ladder,\u201d the data firm CoreLogic noted last month. Many existing homeowners who previously secured ultra-low mortgage rates are likely feeling locked in now, which \u201cintensifies the inventory shortage by further limiting the supply of homes on the market,\u201d it wrote.",
      "Still, newly built homes are coming onto the market in some in-demand parts of the country, CoreLogic said, including Florida and Texas \u2014 \u201coffering a glimmer of hope for a better-balanced market in 2025.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The terrorist behind the deadly New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans posted videos online proclaiming his support for the Islamic State terror group before he rammed his truck into a crowd of people on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14, the FBI said Thursday.",
      "As Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, made his way to Louisiana from his home in Texas on New Year\u2019s Eve, he gave his social media followers a glimpse of his violent plan and radical thinking, according to Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counter-terrorism division.",
      "In a series of Facebook videos posted shortly before the attack, according to Raia, Jabbar said he had originally planned to hurt his family and friends, but pivoted when he grew concerned that news headlines would not focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,\u201d Raia said, adding that Jabbar acted alone. \u201cHe was 100 percent inspired by ISIS.\u201d",
      "Investigators believe Jabbar, an Army veteran, picked up his rented white Ford truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and then headed for New Orleans the next evening.",
      "In the hours before the attack he posted five Facebook videos from about 1:30 a.m. to just after 3 a.m., in which he says he joined ISIS before this summer, Raia said. Jabbar, who was fatally shot by police, also provided a will and testament, Raia said.",
      "Instead of targeting his family, Jabbar set his sights on historic Bourbon Street, though Raia said authorities do not yet fully understand why. The popular tourist area in the French Quarter, which is filled with bars and restaurants, was expected to be busy on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "Surveillance video shows Jabbar personally placing a cooler with an improvised explosive device on Bourbon Street and another one about two blocks away, Raia said. The devices did not detonate and were later rendered safe.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident at this point that he had no accomplices,\u201d he said.",
      "Early Wednesday morning, with a black ISIS flag affixed to the hitch of the Ford F-150 Lightning truck, Jabbar drove onto the sidewalk and around a \u201chard target,\u201d which included officers, barriers and a car.",
      "He plowed into a crowd of revelers, killing at least 14 and wounding at least 35, Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said Wednesday.",
      "Jabbar died in a gunfight with police officers, officials said. He shot two officers, who were in stable condition.",
      "Raia said the FBI has received more than 400 tips from the public, which came from New Orleans and other parts of the country, as he urged more people who had any interaction with the terrorist to come forward.",
      "\u201cWe are looking in everything in his life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you know Jabbar personally, worked with him, served in the military, or saw him in New Orleans or Texas, we need to talk to you.\u201d",
      "The FBI recovered three cellphones and two laptops linked to Jabbar, Raia said, adding that investigators were working to determine the content of the devices.",
      "Jabbar served in the Army on active duty from 2006 to 2015 and then in the Army Reserve from 2015 to 2020, according to three U.S. defense officials. He had deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 and was a staff sergeant when he was honorably discharged in 2020, the officials said.",
      "Jabbar had been working for professional services giant Deloitte in a staff-level role since 2021, the company confirmed to NBC News. He attended Georgia State University from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a BBA in computer information systems, a university spokesperson said.",
      "Civil records show Jabbar was married twice, with his first marriage ending in 2012 and his second in 2022.",
      "A woman who identified herself as Jabbar\u2019s sister-in-law and asked to not be named said relatives in Texas were in shock when they heard the news.",
      "It makes \u201cno sense,\u201d she told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s the nicest person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was a good man. He takes care of his children and everything.\u201d"

      "An online car rental service is under scrutiny after it was used in two incidents Wednesday.",
      "The platform, Turo, is known as an \u201cAirbnb of cars,\u201d as it allows individual car owners to rent out their vehicles. Vehicle owners, known as \u201chosts,\u201d can post cars to Turo\u2019s website, where people can then rent them, with payments made through the platform.",
      "Turo acknowledged it was used in both incidents in an online statement posted Wednesday.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart that we confirm that this morning\u2019s horrific attack in New Orleans and this afternoon\u2019s Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas both involved vehicles rented on Turo,\" the company said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\"",
      "It said it did not believe the individuals who may have rented the autos involved in the incidents had criminal backgrounds \"that would have identified them as a security threat,\" and that it was not aware of any information that indicates the two incidents were related.",
      "Investigators had said earlier that Turo was used to rent a pickup truck that plowed through New Orleans revelers early Wednesday and procure a Tesla Cybertruck that was filled with explosives and burst into flames outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "Authorities have preliminarily said the service\u2019s use in both incidents is a coincidence.\u00a0On Thursday afternoon, authorities said there was not a definitive link between the two incidents.",
      "Turo, previously known as RelayRides, was created in 2009. It came of age during the broader boom in peer-to-peer startups, like Airbnb and Uber, that sought to disrupt many traditional markets including rentals of houses, automobiles and even swimming pools.",
      "But with that disruption came concerns about security. For years, peer-to-peer platforms like Turo have faced criticisms after cars have been stolen to be used for nefarious purposes. The companies have previously responded that such incidents are exceedingly rare. However, over an approximately four-month period between October 2019 and February 2020, NBC News found some 49 reports of motor vehicle thefts in Washington, D.C., involved cars rented from Turo or its rival, Getaround, representing 6% of all incidents during the period.",
      "As of Sept. 30, Turo had approximately 150,000 active hosts worldwide, with 350,000 active vehicle listings and 3.5 million active guests participating on its marketplace, according to a company filing.",
      "Turo\u2019s website tells hosts that they are \u201csafe\u201d in trusting the platform because Turo \u201cscreen(s) each guest,\u201d so hosts can be \u201cconfident when they hand over\u201d their keys.",
      "However, Turo states it cannot reveal information about its screening process other than that it involves a renter, or \u201cguest,\u201d uploading their driver\u2019s license to the platform, with the possibility that Turo may perform credit and insurance-history checks, as well as criminal background ones.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t disclose the details of our screening measures to anyone,\u201d it says on a webpage. \u201cIf we did, they wouldn\u2019t be effective.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to avoid the same fate that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, experienced two years ago: an embarrassing, drawn-out floor fight for the speaker\u2019s gavel.",
      "A small band of right-wing rabble-rousers is threatening to derail Johnson\u2019s bid Friday to retain the speakership. It typically would be a difficult task to take on an incumbent speaker. But Republicans hold such a paper-thin majority in the new 119th Congress that just two GOP defectors could block Johnson from winning the top job for another two years.",
      "Three days ago, Johnson received a big boost when President-elect Donald Trump publicly gave the Louisiana Republican his \u201cComplete & Total Endorsement,\u201d arguing that Johnson's election would help the GOP-controlled Congress execute his 2025 agenda. The speaker said he spent New Year's Day with Trump at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, shortly after a Cybertruck exploded outside a Trump Hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "But Johnson has already lost one GOP vote; Rep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, is rallying colleagues on X against Johnson, whom he blames for striking deals on government spending, Ukraine aid and the renewal of a powerful surveillance program known as FISA Section 702.",
      "Lawmakers said the unpredictable Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., is also someone to watch; she has not committed to backing the speaker and is seeking some assurances.",
      "\u201cI respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan,\u201d Massie wrote on X before the new year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.\u201d",
      "For his part, Johnson is expressing confidence that he\u2019ll retain the gavel in the public roll call set for noon Friday \u2014 the first vote of the new Congress when each House member present must verbally cast their vote for speaker.",
      "Democrats are expected to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. And nearly all Republicans are expected to cast their vote for Johnson, who won his party\u2019s nomination for speaker shortly after the Nov. 5 election.",

The Louisianan also suggested that the House could not afford to delay organizing itself in the new Congress due to national security threats like the deadly New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",

      "Johnson is facing a similar math problem that McCarthy faced just two years ago when a small bloc of conservative rebels \u2014 led by then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. \u2014 teamed with Democrats to prevent McCarthy from winning the gavel. It took 15 rounds of voting over multiple days, and personal phone calls from Trump, to convince the Gaetz group to stand down.",
      "Because of his own small majority, McCarthy would only narrowly win the speakership. But just 269 days later, Gaetz worked with Democrats again to topple McCarthy, sparking a no-holds-barred battle to succeed him which drew all House business to a standstill for three weeks.",
      "In the end, Johnson, then the congenial No. 7 GOP leader in the House with no known enemies, was unanimously elected speaker after more senior-ranking leaders tried and failed.",
      "On Fox, Johnson acknowledged that he's dealing with a challenging \"numbers game.\" Republicans won a 220-215 majority in November. But Gaetz resigned from office after the election and said he would not be sworn in for the new 119th Congress on Friday, cutting the GOP advantage to 219-215.",
      "Johnson would need at least 218 votes \u2014 a simple majority \u2014 to win the gavel if all House members are present on Friday.",
      "He said he spent the holidays reaching out to \u201cevery single one\u201d of his GOP critics. And, he told Fox, he's making the case that he\u2019s the best person for the job and that Republicans \u2014 who starting later this month will control all the levers of power in Washington \u2014 cannot afford to delay enacting Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, which includes renewing tax cuts and strengthening border security.",

      "If Johnson manages to secure the gavel, House Republicans are slated to quickly vote on a rules change that would make it harder to oust him from the speaker's office midway through his two-year term.",
      "Under the current rules, any House lawmaker can force a vote to expel the speaker by filing a resolution known as a \"motion to vacate.\" It's how McCarthy was removed from power.",
      "But the proposed GOP rules package for the new Congress states that no less than nine lawmakers are needed to trigger a floor vote to oust the speaker and the nine must be members of the majority party \u2014 in this case, Republicans.",

A  flag of the Islamic State terrorist group was found in the back of the vehicle.",

      "I can almost guarantee that you\u2019re hunched over your phone, computer or tablet while reading this. We all do it (myself included) since so much of our world revolves around scrolling, tapping and typing. And despite how many years of ballet I took, how many barre, Pilates or yoga classes I do a week, or how much I remind myself to straighten my spine, I often find myself tilting my head forward, rounding my back and tensing up my shoulders like a curled up shrimp \u2014 that\u2019s the best way to describe my default position.",
      "I\u2019ve always been curious about posture correctors, but since they typically look like back braces a doctor might prescribe, I\u2019ve never found them appealing. Now, brands sell options that resemble sports bras, making them easier to incorporate into everyday life. Forme\u2019s Power Bra is undoubtedly the most popular. The brand has been around since 2019, but it\u2019s posture corrector exploded in popularity last year after Taylor Swift wore it while rehearsing for her world tour. It\u2019s sold out multiple times since, according to the brand.",
      "It seems great in theory, but can the Forme Power Bra really improve your posture? I was skeptical, especially due to the almost $200 price tag, so I tested it for five months. Here\u2019s everything I learned along the way, including whether I think it\u2019s actually worth it.",

      "The Forme Power Bra ($189) is a physical posture corrector, meaning a garment that helps you sit or stand taller by pulling your shoulders back and supporting your upper body, says Noam Tamir, a certified strength, conditioning and mobility specialist, and founder of TS Fitness in New York City. These devices prevent you from slouching and hunching, which can lead to better spinal alignment, less muscle tension and less back, neck and shoulder pain, he says.",
      "The Power Bra\u2019s ability to improve your posture lies in its construction. It\u2019s made from eight panels and six fabrics that vary in tension \u2014 some are looser, offering gentle support, while others are tighter, offering more intense support. Together, the panels and tension fabrics apply pressure to different parts of your upper body, which pulls your shoulders back, lifts your chest up and aligns your spine, according to the brand. The bra also has wide straps, which is a hallmark feature of posture-correcting bras, says Tamir. They better support the chest and more evenly distribute weight across the shoulders compared to thin straps.",
      "Forme\u2019s Power Bra is FDA-registered and considered a low-level medical device, according to the brand. In short, this means the FDA knows basic details about Forme, like the products it sells, what they\u2019re intended to do and the brand\u2019s contact details. That does not mean Forme\u2019s Power Bra is FDA-approved or FDA-cleared, which involves a more intense review process of a product\u2019s safety, quality and effectiveness.",
      "You can buy the Power Bra in sizes XS to 3X in six colors. Forme also partnered with Flex, a service that lets you pay for eligible products like the Power Bra with your FSA/HSA card.",
      "How I tested the Forme Power Bra",
      "I\u2019ve been testing the Forme Power Bra, which the brand sent me, since August 2024. Over the past five months, I\u2019ve worn it while exercising at least three times a week for about two to four hours at a time. I wear the bra while walking and using the elliptical machine, as well as during Pilates, barre, yoga and weight lifting classes. I prefer wearing a more structured sports bra with a higher level of coverage to run, so I didn\u2019t run in the Power Bra often. But I tried it a few times and it was comfortable and supportive. To clean the Power Bra, I followed the brand\u2019s directions to put it in the washing machine with gentle detergent on a cold cycle and hang it up to air dry.",
      "The Power Bra comes in alpha sizes (small, medium, large, etc.), so I used the chart on Forme\u2019s website to find the one that most closely matched my bra size. It fits true-to-size, in my experience, but if you\u2019re between sizes, I recommend sizing up because it has a compressive feel.",
      "My experience with the Forme Power Bra",
      "Is the Forme Power Bra effective? Yes, without a doubt, it improves my posture while I wear it. But it\u2019s not a long-term solution to slouching and hunching, so I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s worth the almost $200 investment. That said, here\u2019s everything I liked about the Forme Power Bra and drawbacks you should know about.",
      "What I like",
      "From the moment I first put it on, I could tell that the Power Bra improved my posture. I felt it pull my shoulders back, causing me to lift my chest up and sit or stand taller with a straighter spine. When looking in the mirror while wearing the Power Bra, my back didn\u2019t look super hunched and my body didn\u2019t seem like it was folding in on itself. When wearing it, my head, neck and shoulders stack neatly on top of each other, giving my spine a natural curve \u2014 it\u2019s the posture my former ballet teacher would have praised, and what my current yoga, Pilates and barre teachers all want to see in class. It also gave me a more proud and confident overall stance.",
      "I wore the Power Bra while exercising, and loved going into a workout knowing I\u2019m holding my body in a more aligned position. Maintaining proper posture helps prevent injury and can make all the difference in an exercise\u2019s effectiveness, says Tamir. Additionally, because I spend hours a day using my phone and computer, I admittedly have \u201ctech neck.\u201d My worst habit is shrugging my shoulders up to my ears, which I tend to do whether I\u2019m using my devices or not. Over the years, this has led to frequent pain in my trapezius muscles, and while I try to unclench my muscles and roll my shoulders back every so often, I always forget. Wearing the Power Bra made me more conscious of how I\u2019m holding my body, and it\u2019s a great reminder to check that I\u2019m not shrugging, hunching or slouching.",
      "All that said, after wearing the Power Bra for the past five months, I ultimately experienced similar results from some of my most supportive, well-fitting, much lower-priced sports bras, like the Spanx FlexFeel High Impact Sports Bra ($78), Lululemon Run Times Bra ($68) and Brooks Scoopback Sports Bra ($75). I appreciate that the Power Bra is specifically designed with improving posture in mind, however, and because I think about that while wearing it, I find myself more aware of how I\u2019m holding my body.",
      "There weren\u2019t any instructions to review or steps to complete before I started wearing the Forme Power Bra. Once it arrived, I pulled it over my head and wore it just like I would any other sports bra. While testing it, I either put it on under a shirt or wore it as a crop top with high-waisted leggings. I never need to adjust straps and bands or do specific exercises while wearing the bra, making it a straightforward, low-maintenance garment that\u2019s easy to incorporate into my everyday life.",
      "Unlike many other physical posture correctors, the Power Bra looks like a standard sports bra, not a back brace, so I never felt limited in terms of how or when I could wear it.",
      "When I think of posture correctors, comfort doesn\u2019t immediately come to mind. After all, these devices are designed to change how you hold your body, so they\u2019re bound to feel a little awkward, especially if you\u2019ve never used one before. To my surprise, however, I\u2019ve never found Forme\u2019s Power Bra uncomfortable. It causes me to pull my shoulders back and lift my chest up so I sit and stand straighter, and the tension fabrics create an overall compressive feel. But these sensations aren\u2019t too intense or forceful. Wearing the Power Bra feels similar to wearing an extra supportive sports bra.",
      "The Power Bra\u2019s arm holes were slightly small and restrictive at first, but once I took Forme\u2019s recommendation of stretching them out a little, they felt better. It didn\u2019t limit my range of motion or flexibility, so I practically forgot I have it on.",
      "Throughout my five months testing the Power Bra, which has included dozens of wears and washes, it maintained its compressive feel and didn\u2019t stretch out much, if at all. It\u2019s just as effective now as it was on day one. The only quality issue I noticed is that the small decals on my bra (the brand\u2019s logo on the front and the word \u201cForme\u201d on the back) recently started peeling off. That doesn\u2019t impact the overall look or effectiveness of the Power Bra, but I expected the garment to remain in pristine condition so long as I cared for it properly since it\u2019s almost $200.",
      "Potential drawbacks to keep in mind",
      "While the Power Bra is effective and makes me conscious of my posture while I\u2019m wearing it, I go back to slouching, hunching and tensing up my shoulders when I take it off. I stop thinking about my body\u2019s alignment when I don\u2019t have the garment on, and since that\u2019s the majority of the day, I don\u2019t feel like my posture has improved greatly in the past five months. Although, that\u2019s a common issue with all posture correctors, not something that\u2019s specific to Forme\u2019s. \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing something that gives you support, it can temporarily reduce pain and help to encourage better posture habits that will lead to better body alignment, but it\u2019s not going to be a long-term solution,\u201d says Tamir.",
      "Additionally, for it to work best, Tamir recommends wearing a posture corrector daily for two to four hours. But you shouldn\u2019t wear it all day to avoid becoming overly reliant, he says. I typically wear the Power Bra before I exercise and during my workout, so keeping it on for two to four hours isn\u2019t a problem. Wearing it daily, however, isn\u2019t feasible. The bra gets sweaty while I workout, so I have to wash it between uses and I don\u2019t do laundry every day. I also couldn\u2019t invest in multiple Power Bras since each one is so pricey.",
      "In short, the Power Bra isn\u2019t a long-term solution and it won\u2019t do all the work for you. It\u2019s still important to do posture correcting exercises that target your core and upper body muscles to help keep your body upright in addition to wearing any posture corrector, says Tamir. This will help you become less reliant on the device over time. Given that the Power Bra is almost $200, it\u2019s a big investment for something I can\u2019t use as often as I need to for it to be truly effective and eventually want to become less reliant on.",
      "Other posture correcting bras like the Etalon Posture Bra have adjustable straps, which let you customize their fit and control how much they pull your shoulders back. For products like these, Tamir recommends starting with looser straps to get used to the feel of the posture corrector and making them tighter over time. The Power Bra is not adjustable. I found it to be true-to-size and compressive, so I never wanted to adjust the straps from a fit perspective. But it would be nice to control how much the bra pulls my shoulders back so I could build up to a more intense posture correcting experience over time.",
      "Final verdict: Is the Forme Power Bra worth it?",
      "I only noticed real results with the Power Bra during the limited time I have it on for. It absolutely causes me to hold my body more upright, pull my shoulders back and think about my alignment while I\u2019m wearing it, but it hasn\u2019t made enough of a difference in my posture long-term to justify the almost $200 purchase, in my experience. It\u2019s a solid short-term solution with a limited use case \u2014 due to its high price point, it\u2019s not within my budget to buy multiple versions to ensure I\u2019m using it properly.",
      "Because I got similar posture correcting results from wearing my most supportive, well-fitting, less pricey sports bras mentioned above, I\u2019d recommend investing in a few of those if you\u2019re looking for a discreet device to help align your spine before investing in such an expensive piece, like Forme\u2019s bra. It\u2019s also worth visiting a store in-person to get professionally fitted, in my experience. And while they\u2019re not nearly as attractive as a posture correcting bra, many highly rated back brace style posture correctors, like those from ComfyBrace and Berlin & Daughter, can offer similar results to the Power Bra. They\u2019re typically under $50, too. You only need to wear the posture corrector for a few hours a day, according to the experts I spoke to, so if you plan well, you can easily hide it under clothes or wear it around your home.",
      "That said, if you\u2019re considering buying the Power Bra, manage your expectations before you start wearing it. Also, consider paying with a FSA/HSA card.",

      "Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island could take up to two days.",
      "\u201cGiven the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage available generation to customer demand, which will likely require rotating temporary outages,\u201d Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said in a statement.",
      "The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an underground electric line in the south of the territory.",
      "Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, who is set to take office on Thursday, warned that customers might experience interruptions in the coming days, with power plants not yet operating at maximum capacity.",

At the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, in August, over\u00a0half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm.",
      "The New Year\u2019s Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau says."

      "During that time, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $766,550 or less increased to 6.97% from 6.89%, with points rising to 0.72 from 0.67, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. Mortgage rates, which had been lower than the previous year for much of 2024, were 21 basis points higher annually.",

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Living in Los Angeles has proven to be beneficial in more ways than one for Luke Wilson.",
      "Not only has the actor called LA his home for more than two decades, but it\u2019s also provided plenty of fodder for his latest role as JD Campbell in the new Netflix series \u201cNo Good Deed.\u201d Campbell is a washed-up soap star, or, as Wilson puts it, \u201ca not-very-smart guy.\u201d",
      "\"For me, it was funny to play an empty-headed soap opera actor. I heard the description of the character, and it just started making me laugh just thinking of the ideas you could bring to it,\" Wilson tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "\"I mean, just living in LA, you come across successful actors and people that want to be successful actors, and there's all kinds of material for it,\" he explains.",
      "Wilson is no stranger to the Hollywood-style hijinx that play out in \"No Good Deed,\" a dark comedy that revolves around a group of scheming LA house hunters hoping to score a home being sold by Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano), a grieving couple with some surprising secrets of their own.",
      "\"(There were) definitely things I identified with personally and then certainly things you've seen on set, both good behavior and bad behavior, in set and around town,\" Wilson says of the LA scene.",
      "Along with Kudrow, Romano and Wilson, the new Netflix series also stars O-T Fagbenle, Abbi Jacobson, Poppy Liu, Denis Leary and Linda Cardellini, who plays opposite Wilson as Margo Starling, JD's scheming wife.",

      "In fact, Wilson says that he could relax knowing that Cardellini was in the driver's seat in many of their scenes together.",
      "\"Playing a not-very-smart guy, I would get worried. You want scenes to be dynamic and interesting,\" explains Wilson. \"So, knowing how funny she was, and the kind of energy that she was bringing to each scene, made me think, 'OK, now I can just play my part.'\"",
      "Will there be a 'Legally Blonde 3'?",
      "Though \"No Good Deed\" is Cardellini and Wilson's most recent project together, it's not their first.",
      "\"We first worked together on 'Legally Blonde' 25 years ago, but we didn't have any scenes together,\" says Wilson. \"We were just kind of around each other in this courtroom scene.\"",

      "According to Alexandra Breckenridge, who plays Mel on the show, the next season has not been finalized, which means Charmaine's fate is (possibly) still up in the air.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen necessarily. I have a vague idea, but things change. Storylines change and they\u2019ve definitely changed throughout the seasons of \u201cVirgin River,\u201d she told TODAY.com in a previous interview.",
      "One thing she can guarantee, though, is \"that the road to having a family for Mel and Jack is definitely going to be a big point of Season 7.\"",
      "Here's what fans think might happen to Charmaine and how it ties into Mel's dream of motherhood.",
      "What happened to Charmaine in Season 6 of \u2018Virgin River\u2019?",
      "After giving birth to her twin boys in Season 5, Charmaine adjusted to life as a new mom in Season 6. She wanted to shield her sons from their father Calvin (David Cubitt), a known criminal, but he insisted on being involved in their lives.",
      "In an effort to discourage Calvin and keep her family safe, Charmaine started the process of taking out a restraining order against her children's father.",
      "The hairstylist was supposed to help Mel and her bridal party get ready for her wedding to Jack (Martin Henderson), but was a no-show on the big day. The next morning, Mel was concerned that Charmaine wasn't answering her phone. Jack volunteered to stop by Charmaine's house to check in on her.",
      "When he arrived, Jack noticed that the door was ajar. Worried that someone had broken in, he entered the house and looked around. Jack then entered the nursery and seemed terrified as he looked around the room.",
      "The season ends before viewers can see what shocked Jack. Enter: Fan theories.",
      "\u2018Virgin River\u2019 fans have a theory about Charmaine\u2019s baby and Mel and Jack\u2019s adoption plans",
      "Throughout \u201cVirgin River,\u201d Mel has expressed her desire to become a mother, but it\u2019s been a heartbreaking road filled with several miscarriages.",
      "Now that Mel and Jack have opened up their hearts to adoption, some viewers are wondering if the show\u2019s writers will continue the parenthood arc by killing off Charmaine and leaving the couple to adopt her twin sons.",
      "One Reddit user made the following prediction, writing, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll go first.... Charmaine \u2014 is dead. The babies (sic) father killed her. The father goes to prison and Mel and Jack raise the twins.\u201d",
      "In the same thread, another Reddit user another theory riffing on the same idea: \u201cCharmaine has been kidnapped but the babies were left behind. Mel and Jack take the babies until Charmaine is found. While Charmaine is gone (this could be 5 years we know how they like to do her) they adopt the baby that\u2019s up for adoption.\u201d",
      "Over on X, viewers were equally intrigued, with one user penning the following reaction to the Season 6 finale: \u201cSo is Charmaine dead, Calvin dead! Will Jack and Mel end up adopting the other baby!\u201d",
      "Another X user agrees with the adoption theory \u2014 but has mixed feelings over what it means for Charmaine: \"I don\u2019t even want to think this but did Jack see Charmaine hurt or worse and him and Mel will get the twins?\"",
      "The cliffhanger also revived questions of Charmaine's twins' parentage. She told Jack that he was the father when she was first pregnant, then revealed Calvin was.",
      "\"When are we going to find out that Charmaine\u2019s twins are definitely Jack\u2019s?\" the X user wrote.",
      "One other fan thought Jack\u2019s frightened expression was less about Charmaine's fate and more about the state of her house.",
      "\u201cI really think the plot with Charmaine will not be as exciting or shocking as people want it to be. I don\u2019t think anything happened to her or the babies. The house was probably a mess because Charmaine was overwhelmed taking care of them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "What does Alexandra Breckenridge, who plays Mel, think happened to Charmaine?",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Breckenridge said she\u2019s just as unaware of Charmaine\u2019s fate as viewers, but is optimistic.",
      "\u201cHopefully Charmaine\u2019s OK. I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s OK somewhere. I\u2019m hoping,\u201d Breckenridge said.",

      "What happened to Charmaine in the \u2018Virgin River\u2019 books?",
      "Since \"Virgin River\" is based off a book series, some fans are turning to the books for clues about Charmaine's fate. Since Charmaine doesn't die in the books, killing her off on the show would be a bold move, but not beyond this dramatic show.",

      "Authorities later arrested Matthew Muller on robbery and assault charges in 2015, suspecting him to be behind the abduction plot. Muller, a 2006 graduate of Harvard University and a U.S. Marine from 1995 to 1999, was once a practicing immigration attorney in San Francisco, according to an FBI arrest warrant obtained by NBC Bay Area. Muller, 47, has since been disbarred, according to the California State Bar.",
      "On Monday, Dec. 30, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office announced in a news release that Muller has been charged in two 2009 home invasion sexual assault cases that occurred in Mountain View and Palo Alto, California. The district attorney's office said in a statement that \"advances in forensic DNA testing\" helped the attorney's office connect Muller to the crimes. Muller, who is currently in prison, is now being charged with two felony counts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Muller\u2018s crimes and where he is serving his 40-year prison sentence for kidnapping Huskins.",
      "How did Matthew Muller kidnap Denise Huskins?",
      "Muller broke into Huskins and Quinn\u2019s home on Mare Island in Vallejo, California, between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 23, 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California.",
      "He used a stun gun and a simulated gun with a laser attached to order the victims to the ground, where he bound and blindfolded them with blackened swim goggles, before forcing them to drink sedative, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Muller also played a prerecorded message indicating that not following the commands would lead to physical punishment or electric shock.",
      "He then put Huskins into the trunk of his vehicle, which he drove to his residence in South Lake Tahoe, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Huskins said Muller forced her to have sex with him twice, which he videotaped, while she was held in captivity at the cabin.",
      "During this time, he also sent two emails to Quinn, demanding a ransom of $17,000. Muller released Huskins in Huntington Beach on March 25, 2015, with no ransom ever being paid, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "While Huskins was missing, a Vallejo Police Department detective questioned Quinn for hours, at times suggesting Quinn was involved with Huskins\u2019 disappearance, according to video footage of the interrogation aired in \u201cAmerican Nightmare.\u201d",
      "The day Huskins was released, the department said in a statement investigators had found no evidence of a kidnapping and accused Huskins and Quinn of faking the abduction.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all,\u201d Vallejo police said in the statement. \u201cGiven the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.\u201d",
      "The Vallejo Police Department did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com.",
      "When was Matthew Muller arrested?",
      "Quinn and Huskins\u2019 case remained unsolved until the Dublin Police Services of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Department arrested Muller on charges from a separate home invasion case on June 8, 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "In the Dublin home invasion, a couple had been tied up while Muller attempted to abduct their daughter. Investigators found a cellphone they later traced to Muller, according to authorities.",
      "Dublin police searched Muller\u2018s South Lake Tahoe cabin and located evidence related to Huskins\u2019 abduction, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The FBI then searched the cabin, two other residences, a vehicle and a storage locker.",
      "FBI analysis of Muller\u2018s computers found a \u201csound recording consistent with the instructions given to Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins,\u201d as well as video recordings of Muller sexually assaulting Huskins, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Muller pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping in September 2015 in Huskins and Quinn\u2019s case, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Muller in 2022 pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape in California in Huskins\u2019 case, according to the District Attorney\u2019s office. He also pleaded guilty to state charges of robbery of an inhabited dwelling, residential burglary and false imprisonment.\u2013",
      "When was Matthew Muller sentenced?",
      "U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley sentenced Muller to 40 years in prison for Huskins\u2019 kidnapping in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe sentence imposed today reflects the egregiousness of Muller\u2019s conduct in this case. Muller had advantages in life that most people only dream of, yet he used his considerable intelligence to plan and execute the physical assault and psychological torture of two innocent strangers,\u201d Nunley said during the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to imagine the level of suffering that Muller inflicted on his victims,\u201d Nunley continued. \u201cThe sentence handed down today takes into account that suffering and strives to ensure that Muller will never again commit such crimes.\u201d",
      "Muller\u2018s defense attorney Thomas Johnson declined to comment to the Associated Press after the sentencing hearing, where he argued for a 30-year sentence, as his client had been diagnosed as manic and depressive and could be rehabilitated with proper treatment. (The 2015 FBI arrest affidavit stated Muller told authorities that he suffered from \u201cGulf War Illness\u201d and was bipolar.)",
      "In 2022, Muller was sentenced to 31 years in prison after he pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape and guilty to three other charges in Solano County Superior Court. His state sentence will be served concurrently with the federal sentence.",
      "Where is Matthew Muller now?",
      "Muller is serving his prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson, Arizona, according to the Bureau of Prisons. His release date is scheduled for July 8, 2049, per the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "He gave a jailhouse interview to NBC Bay Area in 2018. Muller said he was married and also said he was not guilty. He said he pleaded guilty to the federal kidnapping charge in 2015 because he felt sorry for the couple.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse for the way the Vallejo Police Department handled it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I thought it was worth it to take a dive and made sure they achieved justice for that wrongful accusation.\u201d",
      "He also said his guilty plea had to do with a \"severe depression\" he fell into while in the Sacramento jail. \"I didn\u2019t care what happened to me,\u201d he said.",
      "Now, Muller is also facing two felony counts for sexual assaults during two home invasions in 2009. He was arraigned on Monday, Dec. 30 and faces life in prison if convicted, the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed in a statement.",
      "\"The details of this person\u2019s violent crime spree seem scripted for Hollywood, but they are tragically real,\" \u00a0District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a news release about Muller's latest charges. \"Our goal is to make sure this defendant is held accountable and will never hurt or terrorize anyone ever again. Our hope is that this nightmare is over.\"",
      "According to the district attorney's office, Muller allegedly broke into a woman's home in Mountain View, California, in the early hours of the morning of Sept. 29, 2009. He allegedly attacked her, bound her and forced her to drink a mixture of medications. He also threatened to rape her.",
      "\"After the victim, in her 30\u2019s, persuaded him against it, he suggested the victim get a dog, then fled,\" the district attorney's office said.",

    "story": [
      "Several famous names and faces went public with their health diagnoses in 2024, with many urging people to get regular screenings and pay attention to their bodies.",
      "Some shared the first symptoms that signaled cancer or other medical concerns.",
      "Here are five of many celebrity health revelations shared this year:",
      "James Van Der Beek",
      "The former \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d star revealed he\u2019s been diagnosed with colorectal cancer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s reason for optimism, and I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d the actor, 47, said in a statement in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a good place and feeling strong.\u201d",
      "Van Der Beek\u2019s first symptoms were changes to his bowel movements, he told People.",
      "Such changes can include narrow stools or an unproductive urge to have a bowel movement, though the most common colorectal cancer warning sign is rectal bleeding, doctors say.",
      "The actor learned he had cancer after undergoing a colonoscopy and is receiving treatment, though he didn\u2019t specify the type. Colorectal cancer can be treated with medication, surgery and chemotherapy, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "Like many people, Van Der Beek thought colon cancer was an older person's disease, but it's now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50, the American Cancer Society notes. This may be due to factors such as eating more processed foods, higher rates of alcohol consumption, obesity and more sedentary lifestyles.",
      "Jenna Fischer",
      "The actress, best known to fans as receptionist Pam Beesly in \u201cThe Office,\u201d announced in October she had been treated for Stage 1 breast cancer.",

      "The diagnosis came after a routine mammogram showed \u201csomething in my left breast,\u201d she added. Since Fischer has dense breasts, which can make cancer harder to spot, doctors recommended a follow-up breast ultrasound, she told TODAY.",
      "The tumor was so small it couldn\u2019t be felt on a physical exam, so Fischer urged women to get their annual screening.",
      "\u201cIf I had waited six more months, it could have been much worse. It could have spread. It was a very aggressive form of cancer,\u201d Fischer said.",
      "She underwent a lumpectomy to remove the tumor in January and received 12 rounds of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiation. She continues to receive medication infusions.",
      "Jamie Foxx",
      "The Academy Award-winning actor finally explained what caused the illness that left him hospitalized and suffering from memory loss last year.",
      "It was \u201ca brain bleed that led to a stroke,\u201d Foxx, 56, said in his Netflix special, \u201cJamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was...\u201d \u2014 released on Dec. 10, 2024. He also revealed he came close to death.",

      "Following physical therapy, the actor said he was starting to feel like himself again.",
      "\u201cWe still don\u2019t know exactly what happened to me. All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer because I needed every prayer,\u201d he said in the special.",
      "Dave Coulier",
      "The \u201cFull House\u201d star revealed in November he\u2019s been diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer.",
      "He was startled to find a golf-ball-sized lump in his groin \u2014 an enlarged lymph node that turned out to be a symptom of the cancer.",
      "Other warning signs include unexplained fever, night sweats and fatigue, according to the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else,\u201d Coulier, 65, told TODAY.",
      "He started chemotherapy and expects a \u201ctotal remission\u201d when he finishes treatment by February 2025.",
      "Coulier shared an emotional moment with TODAY\u2019s Al Roker, a prostate cancer survivor, when the two men hugged in Studio 1A.",
      "Christie Brinkley",
      "The model, who recently posed for Sports Illustrated at age 70, announced in March that she was diagnosed with skin cancer.",
      "The basal cell carcinoma on her temple was caught early and removed, she wrote on Instagram.",
      "This most common type of skin cancer grows slowly and often shows up as a non-healing spot that sometimes bleeds, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.",

      "\u201cAt the VERY end I asked if he could just look at a little tiny dot I could feel as I applied my foundation. He took a look and knew immediately it needed a biopsy! He did it then and there!\u201d she wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have reached a divorce settlement after eight years of contentious back and forth in the public eye, a lawyer for Jolie confirmed to NBC News on Monday night.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family,\" Jolie's attorney, James Simon of Hersh Mannis, said in a statement. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "The settlement was signed and filed on Dec. 30, Jolie's team confirmed with NBC News. Pitt's team declined to comment.",
      "Once Hollywood's most famous couple, Pitt, 61, and Jolie, 49, met on the set of the 2005 movie \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" and got married in 2014. They share six children.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, citing irreconcilable differences. They were officially declared single in 2019 after being granted a bifurcated judgment, which meant they were technically still married but legally separated.",
      "The acrimony since their split has included Pitt filing a lawsuit in 2022 accusing Jolie of intentionally harming him and the French winery business they once shared. The former couple purchased shares in the 148-acre French vineyard Chateau Miraval together in 2008.",
      "The divorce agreement does not affect the legal dispute over the winery, which is ongoing.",
      "Following Pitt's lawsuit about the winery, Jolie filed a cross-complaint in which she alleged Pitt subjected their family to verbal and physical abuse. The \"Maria\" star alleged that Pitt choked one of their children and struck another in the face during a 2016 trans-Atlantic flight.",

      "Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet is earning raves for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in \"A Complete Unknown.\"",
      "The 29-year-old actor practically channels the music legend as a burgeoning star in the early 1960s, transforming his shaggy locks to resemble Dylan's hairstyle and adopting Dylan's signature nasally speaking and singing style.",
      "Chalamet ultimately sang and performed over 40 songs for the movie.",
      "\u201cIt was important for me to sing and play live. Because if I can actually do it, why should there be an element of artifice here? And I\u2019m proud that we took that leap,\u201d Chalamet said in a featurette released ahead of the premiere.",
      "Here's what to know about how Chalamet became Dylan.",
      "Is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing in 'A Complete Unknown'?",

      "Chalamet did originally pre-record Dylan's vocals, revealed Mangold, but the actor wanted to take a stab as performing live in character during an early scene depicting Dylan and Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy).",
      "\u201cWe shot that in the first five or six days,\u201d Mangold recalled. \u201cAnd there was a whole backstage thing with Timmy saying, \u2018I want to try it live.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mangold said his suggestion was met with some skepticism. \u201cSome of the sound and music direction people were like, \u2018It\u2019s not a good idea,'\" Mangold said.",
      "But he opted to allow Chalamet to give it a shot. \u201cAnd he was phenomenal. Not only that, he proved the brilliance of the method,\u201d said the director.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this moment where he finishes that song and he holds a note and just keeps hitting the low string on the guitar over and over again, and he\u2019s just his eyes are kind of boring into Woody, and he\u2019s just holding this note, and it gave him chills,\" Mangold recalled.",
      "\u201cI remember sitting there eight feet from him as he did it, and I remember thinking, \u2018Holy s---.\u2019 That could not have happened if there was an earwig in his ear,\" he added.",
      "Tod Maitland, the movie's sound mixer, told Variety that the biggest musical challenge for Chalamet was varying his vocal stylings to match Dylan's during specific performances.",
      "\"Bob\u2019s a mutterer, and Timmy gave his best mutter, so it was pulling that out. He would go from there to that twangy, tough voice that could shrill your eardrums,\" Maitland said. \"But there were, like four different voices inside of Timmy capturing all those and giving them all character was a whole other dimension.\u201d",
      "Though \"A Complete Unknown\" doesn't show Chalamet singing entire songs, each song was filmed \u201cfrom top to tail,\u201d Ted Caplan, the movie's supervising music editor, said.",
      "Chalamet even performed the entire set of Dylan's landmark 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance, which saw him swap his acoustic guitar for an electric one, much to folk music fans' disapproval.",
      "\u201cThat was recorded as a full concert; from the Hammer song to \u2018Baby Blue,\u2019 it was one run,\u201d Caplan said, adding, \u201cI think it gave it a special live real magic.",
      "\"You can see Timmy is so into it and in the mindset of it,\" Caplan added.",
      "Is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet playing the guitar in \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019?",
      "In addition to singing, Chalamet played accompanying instruments.",
      "Guitar coach Larry Saltzman told the New York Post he began working with Chalamet in 2019, and said the actor \"took to\" playing the guitar \"immediately.\"",
      "\u201cHe never got hung up on something. He just rose to the occasion every time. I think it\u2019s a combination of hard work and just a gift,\u201d he said.",
      "Executive music producer Nick Baxter explained, speaking to the Gibson Gazette, a publication put out by the guitar manufacturer Gibson, how he worked with Chalamet to learn Dylan\u2019s guitar style. They went through the script and emphasized the \u201crawness,\u201d Baxter said.",
      "\u201cDylan\u2019s guitar playing is so unique; it\u2019s sort of messy and violent but also incredibly technically advanced, too. He\u2019s a great player. When you hear some of these early recordings, you can tell he\u2019d been playing guitar all the time, for many years. The technique is there, the playing is there, but there\u2019s a rawness to it. If you don\u2019t capture that, it sounds wrong immediately,\u201d he said.",

He's recovered and now independently searching for the island with the help of the boat captain who rescued him as the police don't believe his story about the games being real.",
      "How does the season end and where is the third, and what seems to be the final, season headed?",
      "Season 2's ending explained",
      "As Gi-hun fights within the games to end them and keep as many people alive as possible, Jun-ho searches for the island with the help of allies Gi-hun enlisted before entering the games a second time.",
      "However, the captain of the boat who has been assisting Jun-ho in finding the island is revealed to be secretly tampering with their search.",
      "By the end of the season, Jun-ho has no luck finding the island and has yet to realize that the boat's captain is actually working to keep the games hidden.",
      "Within the games, the finale begins in the middle of a bloody fight between players. At this point, voting has split the remaining 100 players in half, with half wanting to stay and keep playing the games and half wanting to end the games. With a second vote scheduled for the next day, participants have resorted to killing other players who don't agree with their vote to strengthen their chances of the vote going their way.",
      "Gi-hun, meanwhile, has devised a plan to infiltrate the masked spectators' headquarters to put a stop to the games altogether and, in his words, \"make them pay.\"",
      "His convinces his friends to hide during the chaos instead of fighting to defend others on their side \u2014 which, as Young-il makes him say, shows he's willing to \"sacrifice a few for the good of the rest.\"",
      "While this is a new side to Gi-hun's character, whose goal has been to shed as little blood as possible, he decides a few more lives lost is worth it to end the games once and for all.",
      "When the guards come in to break up the fight, Gi-hun and his friends, who were playing dead, jump the guards and grab their guns, killing all but one in the process.",
      "Gi-hun instructs the surviving guard to bring them to his captain. The rebel crew shoot out the cameras before continuing on through the island fortress.",
      "The Front Man, still pretending to be the friendly Young-il, joins the riot and follows Gi-hun.",
      "The group is intercepted by gun fire before they can reach the game makers. Most of the final episode includes Gi-hun and his rebels fighting back against the pink-suited workers.",
      "Sadly, the rebellion fails, despite some moments of bravery from Hyun-ju who reveals she was in Special Forces before joining the games. They have too little ammo and end up being outnumbered.",
      "While Gi-hun and Jung-bae make it further than most of their crew, they ultimately end up failing when Young-il turns on them.",
      "Young-il splits up from Gi-hun, claiming he saw another way up to where the masked men are shooting down as Gi-hun and Jung-bae. However, when he goes that way, he ends up killing the two players he brought with him and sends a final radio message to Gi-hun pretending that he failed and died.",
      "He then dons the Front Man's classic outfit from Season 1, a long gray coat and black mask. As Gi-hun and Jung-bae surrender (clearly outnumbered), the Front Man slowly descends down the steps to them and, through a voice modulator, asks Gi-hun, \"Did you have fun playing the hero?\"",
      "\"Look closely at the consequences of your little hero game,\" he says as he turns his loaded gun towards Jung-bae, killing him instantly.",
      "Gi-hun tries to fight back but is wrestled to the ground by pink suited workers as the Front Man (whom Gi-hun still doesn't know is Young-il) walks away.",
      "The show fades to black on Gi-hun screaming with grief as his head is pushed into the ground, forcing him to look at Jung-bae and the pool of blood spilling from him.",
      "What does the post-credit scene mean for Season 3?",
      "The post-credit scene is a brief clip of players walking up to the motion sensor doll from Red Light, Green Light. This time, there's a second gigantic doll across from the original one.",
      "The quick scene ends as the light turns from red to green, hinting that the games continue in some form after the failed coup.",
      "Show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk \"originally envisioned seasons 2 and 3 as a single story,\" he told Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\"That\u2019s how I wrote it,\" he told the outlet. \"But in the process, it came out to be too many episodes. So, I thought it\u2019d be better to divide it into two.\"",
      "Dong-hyuk shared a letter that noted that Season 3 will be the show's final season and can be expected to air sometime in 2025, according to Netflix's companion site Tudum."

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 10:53:19 GMT",
    "summary": "A Ukrainian pipeline supplying Russian natural gas to Europe was closed Wednesday after Ukraine declined to renew the deal keeping it open.",
    "story": [
      "A major natural gas pipeline supplying Russian energy to Europe ran dry Wednesday after Ukraine stopped Moscow\u2019s six-decade supply in the hopes of hurting its invader financially.",
      "The planned move marks the end of an era in which many European countries kept warm using gas pumped by Russia \u2014 which was in turn accused of using this dependency to blackmail its Western neighbors after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, something it denies.",
      "Gazprom confirmed in a statement that the pipeline agreement had lapsed following \u201crepeated and explicit refusal to extend these agreements\u201d by Ukraine.",
      "Just as the pipeline agreement expired, Russia launched its latest salvo of drone attacks on Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to build on his battlefield momentum by targeting Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure during its bitter winter.",
      "Most of Russia\u2019s 111 drones were repelled by Ukraine\u2019s Western-backed missile defense systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technology, officials said, although at least six people were injured and two killed in the capital Kyiv.",
      "\u201cEven on New Year\u2019s Eve, Russia was only worried about how to hurt Ukraine,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said early Wednesday.",
      "Ukraine is embattled militarily, with Russian forces making frontline gains in recent months, as well as being shrouded by geopolitical uncertainty. President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to enter office later this month, has unnerved many in Europe by refusing to commit to the same multibillion dollar support for Ukraine provided by the Biden administration.",
      "As well as launching attacks into Russian territory, Ukraine is trying to hurt Moscow in other ways. Part of that is not renewing the pipeline agreement, which expired having supplied Europe with Russian gas via Ukraine for six decades.",
      "\u201cWe stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event,\u201d Ukraine Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko said in a statement. \u201cRussia is losing markets, it will suffer financial losses.\u201d",
      "Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski posted to X that the development was apt comeuppance for Putin, who he accused of trying to \"blackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies.\"",
      "The move was no surprise; Ukraine repeatedly said it would not renew the deal that Zelenskyy said earlier this month gave Russia \u201cthe opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.\u201d",
      "But it will not be painless, with Ukraine losing up to $1 billion a year in transit fees it charged Russia to use its pipeline, Reuters reported. That\u2019s less than the $5 billion Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant, is set to lose annually, according to the news agency.",
      "Gazprom confirmed in a statement Wednesday that the pipeline agreement had lapsed following \"repeated and explicit refusal to extend these agreements\" by Ukraine.",
      "Most European countries no longer depend on Russian gas having diversified their supply \u2014 to the United States, Qatar and others \u2014 following Putin\u2019s Feb. 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nevertheless halting the pipeline saw European Union natural gas prices rise to 50 euros ($52), their highest since the 330 euro spike in 2022 following the invasion.",
      "Turning off the taps may also impact Austria, Slovakia and particularly Moldova \u2014 which is not part of the E.U. \u2014\u00a0 all of whom rely on Russian gas more than most in Europe. Already in the Moldovan breakaway region of Transdniestria, home to 450,00 people and 1,500 Russian troops, the local energy company cut off domestic hot water and heating supplies Wednesday, Reuters said.",
      "Not only is Russia's Ukrainian natural gas artery down, the Nord Stream gas pipelines remain damaged by as-yet unexplained explosions in Sept. 2022. That only leaves the TurkStream pipeline linking Russia with Turkey, Hungary and Serbia."

      "Local health officials vehemently dispute claims that medical centers are used by Hamas or other militants. NBC News was not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s claims.",
      "Israeli forces' repeated attacks on hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza have left the enclave's health care system decimated amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, with most facilities damaged or destroyed in Israel's more than a yearlong military offensive.",
      "\"If a hospital has been reduced to a bombed-out shell, it would cease to be protected, but otherwise a hospital, whether immediately used or not, is presumptively protected as an important civilian institution,\" Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, previously told NBC News. \"It can be attacked only if actively used for military purposes, and even then, only if the civilian harm is not disproportionate.\"",
      "The Illinois-based nonprofit organization MedGlobal was also among those to condemn the IDF's attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital, calling it a \"brutal violation of a protected medical space\" as it echoed calls for Abu Safiya's release.",
      "\"Dr. Abu Safiya and his team constitute the lifeline of healthcare provision in northern Gaza,\" Rajaa Musleh, MedGlobal\u2019s Gaza country director, said in a statement.",
      "More than 45,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israeli forces launched their offensive in the enclave after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict."

    "story": [
      "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
      "After a year of significant gains for Russia, looming large is the presidency of Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war in \u201ca single day\u201d \u2014 even if he has indicated that he is in part sympathetic to Moscow\u2019s arguments and has remained skeptical of promising open-ended military aid to Kyiv.",
      "Some experts believe that, for this reason, it\u2019s likely that Ukraine, and Europe, will need to prepare for a prolonged war.",
      "\u201cTrump, with his unpredictable policy on military support for Kyiv and on how to end the war, will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Justyna Gotkowska, the deputy director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a think tank based in Warsaw, said in an op-ed last week.",
      "After more than 1,000 days of war, Ukraine is running short on manpower while the Kremlin has stepped up bombings of cities and infrastructure, launching missiles, drones and artillery rounds at civilian targets.",
      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter worked for decades to eradicate Guinea worm disease around the world.Whereas 3.5 million cases of the painful parasitic infection were recorded in 1986, preliminary data indicates there were just 11 this year.Carter died Sunday at age 100.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter worked for decades to eradicate Guinea worm disease around the world.",
      "Whereas 3.5 million cases of the painful parasitic infection were recorded in 1986, preliminary data indicates there were just 11 this year.",
      "Carter died Sunday at age 100.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter hoped to outlive the Guinea worm \u2014 and he came achingly close to achieving that goal.",
      "Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, and his nonprofit, the Carter Center, led a decades-long campaign against the disease, marshalling funding, tracking cases, helping to quell outbreaks and organizing support among world leaders and health agencies.",
      "Guinea worm infections are caused by a parasitic worm whose larvae can contaminate water. When people consume the tainted water, the larvae mature inside the body, growing to about 3 feet long. The worms then burrow out of people\u2019s bodies, blistering the skin as they exit in an agonizingly painful process that can take weeks.",
      "In 1986, five years after Carter\u2019s presidency ended, 3.5 million cases of the disease were recorded globally. As of early December, preliminary data indicates that just 11 cases have been recorded this year, and in just two countries \u2014 Chad and South Sudan, according to Adam Weiss, the director of the Carter Center\u2019s Guinea Worm Eradication Program.",
      "\u201cWe continue to see a tightening of how widely distributed the disease is from more than 20 countries in the 1980s to just a few so far this year,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cA lot of good progress is being shown.\u201d",
      "In 1986, the World Health Assembly called for eradication of Guinea worm disease. The Carter Center, a nonprofit created by the former president, stepped in to lead the effort, partnering with health departments in partner countries, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carter visited a village in Ghana in 1988 that was suffering from Guinea worm infections, and he often spoke about an image that haunted him from that visit \u2014 of a Guinea worm emerging from a woman\u2019s swollen breast.",
      "\u201cIt left such a deep imprint on him, not because he saw despair. He felt the despair, but what he saw was there\u2019s an opportunity,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt was something he couldn\u2019t turn his back on.\u201d",
      "Carter remained focused on the project until his death, telling reporters in 2015 that he wanted \u201cthe last Guinea worm to die before I do,\u201d according to The Associated Press. He received updates on Guinea worm even after he entered hospice care, the AP reported.",
      "Only one human disease \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated by human efforts. Guinea worm disease could become the second, though it may take years and new methods to push the effort across the finish line.",
      "The disease, which is most often reported in rural, impoverished areas without clean drinking water, remains endemic in several African countries. People can be infected by multiple worms at a time \u2014\u00a0one man in Nigeria suffered as health workers removed more than 80 worms from his body in 1999.",
      "Unlike smallpox, there is no vaccine or treatment to stop Guinea worm disease. So the Carter Center has worked with African and Asian health agencies to change how rural villagers live daily life by offering education about how the disease spreads and how to prevent it, providing water filters to those in need and using larvicides to control outbreaks.",
      "By 2000, the disease had been eliminated from Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cYou need a champion like President Carter to say, \u2018This is the flagship program of the Carter Center in health. We want this done,\u201d said Dr. Jordan Tappero, the deputy director of neglected tropical diseases for the Gates Foundation, which has given funding to the Carter Center\u2019s work.",
      "The World Health Organization\u2019s goal is to eradicate Guinea worm disease by 2030. For that to happen, global cases have to remain at zero for three consecutive years.",
      "This year\u2019s preliminary case total of 11 represents a record low, but Tappero said more work lies ahead and new methods are likely required to achieve eradication.",
      "Complicating the efforts are cases of Guinea worm disease detected in domestic animals. Guinea worm disease was first detected in dogs in 2012, forcing a shift in strategy.",
      "\u201cInfection in dogs and cats in these last countries makes it harder to get there by 2030,\u201d Tappero said. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach a dog to say this pond is safe to drink from, and that one\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "Tappero said researchers are developing tools to immediately detect signs of the disease in water samples, working on diagnostic tests that could identify cases months before the parasite emerges and pursuing trials of a drug called Flubendazole for use in infected dogs.",
      "In 2022, the Carter Center held a summit for some of the last countries fighting the disease. Angola, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan and Sudan all agreed to accelerate their efforts to eradicate Guinea worm.",
      "\u201cThat kind of political will is so important \u2014 having that kind of high-level commitment coupled with at the village level. People just want to get this done,\u201d Weiss said. The path Carter paved, he added, makes it \u201cpretty straightforward now.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 1, 2025, 7:15 p.m. ET): A photo caption in a previous version of this article misstated where children were pictured collecting drinking water from a pond. It was in the country of South Sudan, not in southern Sudan."

      "It\u2019s the first time a warrant has been issued to detain a sitting South Korean president. But experts say there is little chance of detention or searches unless Yoon is formally removed from office.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court issued warrants to detain Yoon and to search the presidential office and residence in central Seoul, according to a statement from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities.",
      "The agency says it\u2019s been investigating whether Yoon\u2019s Dec. 3 declaration amounted to rebellion.",
      "Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon\u2019s powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, during which hundreds of troops and police officers were deployed at the assembly. By law, a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament\u2019s operations even under martial law.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party \u2014 which he has called \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces\u201d \u2014 that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government\u2019s budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants.",
      "Yoon Kap-keun, a lawyer for the president, called the detainment warrant \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cillegal,\u201d saying the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. The presidential security service said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on when it would proceed with the warrants.",
      "\u201cUnless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cShould investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\u201d",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon\u2019s residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",
      "Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant is likely an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with investigations.",
      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon\u2019s deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn\u2019t trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim.",
      "Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \u201cquickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\u201d Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon\u2019s orders.",

Observers say adding more justices could increase prospects for the court\u2019s endorsement of Yoon\u2019s impeachment as that requires support from at least six justices.",

It\u2019s so popular that the cost of its staple ingredients \u2014 which usually include sausage, potatoes and dollops of mayonnaise \u2014 have their own price index that\u2019s tracked by the media.",
      "With soaring inflation and the ruble dropping to one of its lowest levels against the dollar since President Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine, this year Russians will have to pay more for the dish, which is traditionally served alongside caviar and tangerines, before the New Year is toasted in.",
      "Along with rising food prices, a weaker ruble following the latest round of American sanctions in November has fueled inflation and driven up the cost of imports into Russia. A huge increase in military spending has also led to labor, supply and production shortages. And while workers from every industry have volunteered or been called up to serve in Ukraine, farming has been among the worst affected.",
      "The so-called Olivier Index, which monitors how much it costs to make one of the salads for four people, is up 16% year over year, to 414 rubles from 348, according to Rosstat, Russia\u2019s federal statistics agency. (That\u2019s equivalent to a jump to $3.94 from $3.31.)",
      "And prices have shot up for other groceries such as eggs (up 45% since January) and butter (up almost 40%), according to data released this month by Rosstat. Potatoes, meanwhile, cost almost twice as much as they did a year ago. Between November and December alone, they rose 10% from 99.99 rubles to 109.99, according to an NBC News analysis. While not a staple food, caviar has shot up to almost 9,000 rubles per kilo from 6,000 in December 2023, Rosstat found.",

      "\u201cI can support myself even in the current situation. But as long as I cannot do anything about the economic situation, I prefer not to waste my emotions on it,\u201d she added.",
      "But that puts her in the minority, as rising prices become the most pressing concern for Russians in most regions, according to a study published Dec. 27 by CROS, a Moscow-based marketing and communications agency. Prices replaced the war in Ukraine as the main concern for the first time since February 2022, when Putin ordered the invasion of his neighbor, according to the findings, which are based on analysis of social media trends and reports in traditional news media.",
      "\u201cThe rise in prices is particularly painful for the poorest, but the middle class \u2014 accustomed to higher levels of consumption and frequently purchasing imported goods \u2014 may feel the impact more acutely,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin based nongovernmental organization, said earlier this month.",
      "And that was certainly the case for Moscow-based university worker Anna, 37, who said the cost of \u201cbaby foods, diapers and so on grew colossally,\u201d as sanctions started to bite shortly after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine and her son turned 1.",
      "Prices \u201cbounced back a bit later, but since then everything has rather been getting more and more expensive,\u201d she said.",
      "Anna did not want her last name or the name of her husband to be published out of fear of retribution against her family. Putin\u2019s war next door has brought a far-reaching crackdown on dissent at home, and anything that can be perceived as an anti-war stance could result in arrest or even jail time.",
      "She added that meat and fruit prices had also risen, but she was still prepared to splurge.",
      "\u201cWhen I see the final sum at the checkout, I start worrying as it used to be significantly smaller for the same list,\u201d Anna said. \u201cBut I still buy the same, I am not cutting back on anything.\u201d",
      "She added that she was going to make Olivier salad for New Year's but would use potatoes grown by her mother-in-law, who like many Russians is mindful of previous economic hardship and keeps her own vegetable garden.",
      "\u201cAs for the sparkling wine, we will go with Italian. We are ready to pay more for it,\u201d Anna said.",
      "Her husband\u2019s \u201cmajor complaint is that there is no good beer anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just does not like Russian beer brands.\u201d",
      "An overheating economy?",
      "Addressing the economy at his annual end-of-year news conference earlier this month, Putin said that inflation was a problem and that  the country\u2019s economy was \u201coverheating.\u201d In part, he blamed international sanctions for price rises, \u201cbecause they make logistics more expensive,\u201d but he also appeared to criticize Russia\u2019s central bank for failing to tame inflation.",
      "In an apparent response, the bank did not raise its interest rate to 23% the following day, a move that had been widely expected.",
      "While the social and financial difficulties have yet to translate into significant political dissent \u201ceven with substantial repression,\u201d avoiding large-scale anger over economic issues \u201cmatters to the authorities and it appears to matter to Putin,\u201d Alex Brideau, of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "He added that Putin had \u201cbeen able to shift the blame for high prices away from himself and onto the government or businesses in the past and will probably do that again.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, the rising prices would \u201cput a lot of pressure on the government to show that it is handling the situation with minimal disruption to the public\u2019s holiday festivities.",
      "Back in Russia, music teacher Govorukhina was determined to make the best of the New Year celebrations.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t eat a lot when we were younger, and now as we have gotten older we need even less. I can afford caviar, but not crab meat, though it is now hard to find a good one,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have friends who complain, but I am not like that. Your lifestyle is more important than money. I love music and going to concerts, I love my job \u2014 this helps to somewhat cushion these blows. We have never had a rich life.\u201d",
      "Lena Medvedeva reported from Moscow. Karen Glichrist and Henry Austin from London."

    "story": [
      "A woman will lead the Central Bank of Syria for the first time in the institution's 70-year history after the country\u2019s new leadership appointed Maysaa Sabrine, a former deputy governor of the bank, to helm it.",
      "In leading the institution that manages the country's currency and sets its monetary policy, she will be in a prime position to help heal an economy shattered by 13 years of war and stringent international sanctions. Today, about 70% of Syria's population lives in poverty, and another 30% in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "Sabrine, whose appointment was reported by Reuters, is expected to replace Mohammed Issam Hazime, who had been named governor in 2021 by since-ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad.",
      "She now faces the task of leading the bank through a dire financial landscape, with Syria\u2019s economy having deteriorated significantly in the years since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.",
      "Her rise to the top role comes as Syria's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and his Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham\u00a0group, which led rebel forces in the Assad regime's ouster, seek to project a more moderate image, promising an inclusive society in which the country's myriad religious and ethnic groups, as well as women, will be represented.",
      "In a recent interview with the BBC, Sharaa sought to contrast his vision for a future Syria against the leadership of the Taliban in Afghanistan, where women have faced extreme restrictions that bar them from public spaces, as well as from seeking higher education.",
      "Pointing to HTS' record in Idlib in Syria's northwest, where the rebel group has governed for years, he noted that he believed in educational access for women.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,\u201d Sharaa said, adding: \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sabrine had already held a number of prominent roles within Syria's central bank, including first deputy governor and supervising director, according to the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya.",
      "In addition, Sabrine, who holds a master\u2019s degree in accounting, has also served as a member of the Damascus Securities Exchange Board of Directors since 2018, representing the Central Bank, according to the broadcaster.",
      "In the days since Assad's ouster, the Central Bank has sought to liberalize Syria's economy, which was previously heavily controlled by his regime.",
      "Sharaa has called on Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to lift the crippling sanctions that targeted the Assad regime.",
      "The U.S. earlier this month removed a $10 million bounty that was placed on Sharaa himself after meetings between U.S. diplomats and the HTS leadership. But HTS itself remains on Washington's terrorist list.",
      "While the weeks since Assad's ouster Dec. 8 have remained relatively stable in Syria, Sharaa said over the weekend in an interview with Al Arabiya that it could take up to four years for new elections to be held.",
      "And fears have grown that the delicate and relative peace that has washed over Syria in the days since Assad's overthrow could be easily disrupted. Protests by members of the Alawite community, the minority sect the Assad family belongs to, erupted last week in Homs after video showing an Alawite shrine in Aleppo being vandalized circulated online.",
      "The demonstrations prompted the country's revamped security forces to institute new security measures in Homs, the country's third-largest city, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters also took to the streets in Christian neighborhoods of Damascus last week after a Christmas tree burning deepened fears that new leadership would still oversee a crackdown on religious minorities in the country.",
      "But in Homs, which has a diverse population of Sunni and Shia Muslims, as well as Christians and Alawites, a relatively peaceful Christmas in the Christian suburb of Fayrouzeh appeared to help assuage some fears.",
      "\u201cWe had a very beautiful holiday even though there was some anxiety before it,\u201d one Fayrouzeh resident, Sarab Kashi, told the AP. \u201cThe guys from HTS volunteered and stood as guards on the door of the churches.\u201d",
      "But whether Syria\u2019s new leadership will be able to maintain that relative calm remains to be seen, with the international community keeping a close eye on the shifting circumstances in Damascus."

      "Lee Dong-Suk, who lost his aunt and uncle in the crash, told NBC News on Monday that he thought the government should work faster to identify the bodies and provide families with more information.",
      "\u201cAt first, the government told us that they found the bodies and that they were making efforts towards identifying them. So we waited and waited because they did not tell us how long we had to wait, where to wait and what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it became an endless waiting with no end in sight for us."

      "\"It's gorgeous, [but] it is wearing a little bit,\" Maher said, her right index finger swirling the edges of the medal.  \"It's a solid hunk of metal; it's a great piece of metal.\"",
