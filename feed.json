      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "The Belmond hotel is where George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Julia Roberts and more stars stayed during the festival. On a separate island from the Lido, its location offers celebrities a tad more privacy.",
      "The cocktail was invented by bartender Walter Bolzonella with Clooney, at the Cipriani\u2019s Bar Gabbiano. Described on the menu as \u201cfresh, fruity, low alcohol,\u201d it's made with vodka, lime, ginger, cucumber and cranberry. (For the record, it's not more expensive than the hotel's other signature cocktails.)",

      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon. The Palazzo del Cinema, featuring three movie theaters, is the main headquarters of the festival. It takes 32 minutes to make the journey, by vaporetto, the public water bus. (For good measure, pun somewhat intended, 4.5 kilometers is just under 3 miles.)",
      "Over the decades, few tableaux are as glamorous as movies stars arriving, stylishly disheveled, by launch to the festival. Ferried to and from the Lido, celebrities, journalists and members of the public with passes cross the Venetian Lagoon. Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",
      "Every film shown at Venice has to have subtitles burned in: Non-Italian-language movies must have Italian subtitles, and Italian-language movies must have English subtitles. (All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival has wrapped up, but the buzz continues",
      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival may be over, but the conversations on the films that premiered, the things people said, the clothes they wore, and how it affects the Oscar race are still going.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of the big moments and takeaways from this year\u2019s edition.",
      "Jim Jarmusch\u2019s quiet film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d took the top prize, the Golden Lion. It was a surprise to many who expected that honor to go to \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which ended up with the runner up award, or \u201cNo Other Choice.\u201d",
      "Aside from Benny Safdie\u2019s best director win for \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d Hollywood players were largely shut out of the awards in favor of a diverse, international selection. Chinese actor Xin Zhilei won best actress for Cai Shangjun\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Rises on Us All,\u201d Italian icon Toni Servillo won best actor for \u201cLa Grazia\u201d and Swiss actor Luna Wedler took the up-and-comer prize, the Marcello Mastroianni Award, for \u201cSilent Friend.\u201d",
      "The awards didn\u2019t give many hints, but Venice has been known to launch several best actor campaigns including Joaquin Phoenix in \u201cJoker,\u201dBrendan Fraser in \u201cThe Whale\u201d and Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d This year the most obvious heavyweight to follow is Dwayne Johnson for his turn as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons were also strange and fierce as kidnapped and kidnapper in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s provocative \u201cBugonia.\u201d Oscar Isaac portrayed Victor Frankenstein as a romantic madman and Jacob Elordi was na\u00efve and raw as the monster. Amanda Seyfried put a human, feminist, face to the religious sect the shakers in \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee,\u201d and Julia Roberts flexed her acting muscles as a Yale philosophy professor in the midst of a misconduct accusation against a colleague in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "Filmmakers like Kathryn Bigelow and previous Golden Lion winners Guillermo del Toro and Yorgos Lanthimos will also likely be in the conversation for months to come.",
      "There\u2019s always some unexpected Hollywood person at the Venice Film Festival who doesn\u2019t seem to be associated with any one film. Sometimes they\u2019ve come in for amfAR, sometimes they\u2019ve been invited by one of the festival\u2019s sponsors. But text chains started blowing up when Seth Rogen started popping up everywhere: Red carpets, press conferences, parties. Don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a Venice episode of \u201cThe Studio\u201d in the works: This trip was research, and maybe even a little more.",
      "In a cute, unexpected (possibly highly staged) moment during the festival, Amanda Seyfried commented on Julia Roberts\u2019 Instagram asking to \u201cplease let me wear the same outfit.\u201d Three days later, Seyfried was also rocking the Versace blazer, jeans, button up and belt, just with different shoes. It helps that they share a stylist, Elizabeth Stewart.",
      "First, let\u2019s just make clear that entertainment trade publications only started tracking Venice standing ovations recently. This year, audiences at the premiere of \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d applauded for 22-minutes, surpassing the 18-minute record set last year by \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which went on to win the Golden Lion. Even with a limited data set, that\u2019s a long time to clap after a movie.",
      "Other standing ovation times from the 82nd festival: \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ((tilde)5 minutes), \u201cBugonia\u201d ((tilde)6 minutes), \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d ((tilde)7 minutes), \u201cJay Kelly\u201d ((tilde)9 minutes), \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d ((tilde)10 minutes), \u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d ((tilde)11 minutes), \u201cFrankenstein\u201d ((tilde)14 minutes), \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes), \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes).",
      "The festival might not take political stances, but politics, and filmmakers grappling with the state of the world, from the Israel-Hamas conflict to nuclear weapons, were clearly top of mind. Kathryn Bigelow set off a warning shot about nuclear weapons and the apparatus of decision making with her urgent, and distressingly realistic, thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite.\u201d Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania made an essential document of the human toll in Gaza with \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d And Olivier Assayas charted the rise of Vladimir Putin in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",

      "The documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his \u2018Radio Kandy\u2019 show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.\u201d",

To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",

      "Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy\u2019s since growing up watching \u201cSCTV\u201d reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.",
      "\u201cI feel like in the bigger movies I\u2019m always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from \u201cPlanes, Trains,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.\u201d",
      "As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the \u201cDeadpool\u201d films. In one moment, he utters the \u201cI like me,\u201d albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene. He even licensed the book \u201cThe Canadian Mounted: A Trivia Guide to Planes, Trains\u201d so it could make a cameo in all the \u201cDeadpool\u201d movies.",

All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody\u2019s willing to suck at anything.\u201d",
      "For Jennifer and Chris, \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d awash in memories of their father,\u201d is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured.",

      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \u201cdamages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\u201d if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",
      "The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren\u2019t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,\u201d said Thomas Heldrup, the group\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement.",
      "On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,\u201d Heldrup said.",
      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she\u2019s considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday\u2019s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers",
      "SAO PAULO -- Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she's considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006. Corinthians has gone unbeaten in all but one game played right before each album release since then and all but one right after.",
      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",
      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following. But the NFL game in Sao Paulo, which could draw Swift to NeoQuimica Arena, has kept the Swiftie vibe alive among many local supporters.",
      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "For Giorgio Armani, it was always the clothes",
      "MILAN -- For Giorgio Armani, it was always the clothes. And his clothes all started with the fabrics.",
      "While other fashion empires make their money on handbags and footwear, Armani\u2019s appeal has always been in the apparel, the core of his $10 billion empire.",
      "After his death Thursday at the age of 91, Armani has been remembered for softening the 1980s power suit, decades of fruitful Hollywood collaborations and as a defining figure of Italian luxury ready-to-wear.",
      "But he was also a keen business owner who maintained his independence in an era of consolidation, an innovative communicator and a boss who was in charge of every aspect of his business.",
      "\u201cI have to say, King George is the first in everything. The first but not the only,\u2019\u2019 said Mario Boselli, who was president of the Italian fashion chamber from 1999-2015. \u201cHe was the master of luxury ready-to-wear.\u201d",
      "The deconstructed, soft-shouldered Armani jacket catapulted Armani to fashion stardom, first with Richard Gere in the 1980 film \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 and then as the centerpiece of a women\u2019s wardrobe.",
      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shuman said the fabric choices made going into Armani's stores \u201ca sensory overload.\u201d",

      "Armani\u2019s aesthetic of timeless elegance was constant throughout the decades, which at times made fashion critics question its relevance. But Armani always had a following, from Hollywood stars who could count on him for stunning looks without too much risk, to everyday people who sought well-made, tailored looks to project them from morning to evening.",
      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis aesthetic was refined, and approachable. You cannot become a $10 billion brand when you are consistently doing the same thing over and over again, without being approachable. He sells. People want to wear his clothing.\u201d",
      "Giorgio Armani's final collection will be previewed during Milan Fashion Week later this month during an event marking 50 years of his signature fashion house.",
      "Armani set up a foundation as a succession tool to avoid his businesses being split up. A rarity in the Italian fashion world, he never sold even a part of his company to an outsider.",
      "He also indicated the creative succession would go to longtime collaborator Leo Dell\u2019Orco and his niece Silvana Armani, who have headed the menswear and womenswear collections, respectively, for all Armani collections: Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Exchange.",
      "The question of generational succession has always been a fraught one in Italy's largely family run fashion industry. Armani's attention to every detail in the empire he launched 50 years ago will make him a tough act to follow.",
      "\u201cHe was involved in very step of the process from the very beginning to the end. Every photograph, every font, everything,'' Arbesser said. \"That is what makes a difference. These days, there is no boss, no creative director, who has so much control over everything. That is where the magic is. And that is where it is hard to see what is going to happen now.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who was inspired by his father to spend years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, died Tuesday at age 97.",
      "Hemingway, the second of the author's three sons, died at his home in Bozeman, Montana, his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, confirmed in a statement.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",
      "As an executor of his father's estate, Patrick Hemingway approved reissues of such classics as \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"A Moveable Feast,\" featuring revised texts and additional commentary from the author\u2019s son and others. The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure. Patrick's half-niece, the actor and model Margaux Hemingway, died from an overdose of phenobarbital in 1996. (Jack Hemingway, the eldest son, died in 2000).",
      "Inheriting his father\u2019s round face and stocky build, Patrick Hemingway was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Ernest Hemingway and the second of his four wives, Pauline Pfeiffer. Because the author rarely stayed in one place for an extended time, the Hemingways lived everywhere from Cuba and Spain to Wyoming and Key West, Florida during Patrick\u2019s childhood (Ernest and Pauline divorced in 1940). Patrick Hemingway would recall his father\u2019s various \u201ctrophy mounts\u201d of animals hunted down on safari and how they were \u201ctastefully distributed throughout every room\u201d of their Key West house, including a wildebeest that hung in the bedroom of Patrick and Gregory.",

      "At least, that used to be the case.",
      "In the last few years, a new generation of songwriters has begun stepping into the spotlight. Muni Long has a successful R&B career; songwriter HARDY has done the same in the country music space. Julia Michaels writes big pop hits and records her own. Victoria Mon\u00e9t went from Grammy nominations as a songwriter and producer to taking home trophies as a solo artist.

      "Kim Novak has made an emotional return to the spotlight at 92",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kim Novak was worried she\u2019d made a mistake. The 92-year-old star of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo\u201d had made the long trek from Oregon to Venice, Italy, for the film festival. There she\u2019d be receiving a lifetime achievement award and supporting the world premiere of a documentary about her life and career, \u201cKim Novak\u2019s Vertigo.\u201d",
      "But on that first day, she wasn\u2019t feeling strong or up to the task.",
      "\u201cI thought I could handle it, then I thought, no I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not physically strong enough,\u201d Novak told The Associated Press this week. \u201cThen I heard my mother\u2019s voice from heaven and she said \u2018just have fun and enjoy it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Novak listened to that voice and was glad she did. Being bipolar, she said, she\u2019s used to going through a lot of emotions. But the experience in Venice has been a dream.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very first events that I\u2019ve really had fun, really fun,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier in the week, she was presented with a Golden Lion lifetime achievement award. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, who presented the honor, listed off many of her most famous credits, including \u201cVertigo,\u201d Otto Preminger\u2019s \u201cThe Man with the Golden Arm,\u201d Joshua Logan\u2019s \u201cPicnic,\u201d \u201cPal Joey\u201d and \u201cBell, Book and Candle.\u201d Novak was the top box-office star in the world from 1958 through 1960 and became the first woman to start her own production company before leaving Hollywood behind in 1966 to live a private life devoted to painting.",
      "\u201cMost impressive is the fact that she was capable of projecting frailty, power, mystery. To appear, endearing, dynamic, mythical and phenomenal,\u201d del Toro said. \u201cAnd with all those wonderful arresting performances, she always carried a little bit of warmth, a little bit of heartbreak and a little bit of mystery.\u201d",
      "Novak reflects on her extraordinary life in Alexandre O. Philippe\u2019s documentary, which premiered out of competition in Venice. She said it was fate that Philippe came into her life and wanted to make the film.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I wanted to talk about my life, because I\u2019m at the end of my life,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt was meant to be. And I can\u2019t think of anyone it was better to do it with.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my phone had voice memos,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy for me to open up and discuss the intimate things, but it was wonderful because it was like I was talking to myself. Once you open the door, it all comes flooding out.\u201d",
      "Coming to the festival was brave of Novak, Philippe said. Just over a decade ago, Novak stepped back in the public eye to present at the 2014 Oscars, which led many online, including Donald Trump, to insult her appearance.",
      "\u201cThe easy thing would have been to stay in Oregon and keep painting,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point in her life the hard thing is to come back into the spotlight and show herself again. But she did the hard thing. And she came on stage, not as an icon, not as a movie star, but she came on stage and said \u2018I am you and you are me.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time at the end of your life to put the puzzle pieces together and make them fit,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible experience to see them all falling in place and somehow coming to this festival is like putting some of the other pieces that you couldn\u2019t put together that now come together and make a whole beautiful, beautiful, picture.\u201d",
      "Even the \u201cVertigo\u201d suit she once hated so much as taken on a different light. In the film, she gets to see the costume for the first time since making the film. The fabric that she remembered having been so rough and hard had softened with time, which seemed like an apt metaphor.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to see it when you have all this life behind you, it makes you think that what you thought was right when you were young is not necessarily so. It could be wrong, and vice versa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all this you gain over time. And so becoming old is a beautiful thing, you know? And this festival, being able to experience it through Hollywood eyes, it\u2019s just incredible. I loved it, I love it. I\u2019m experiencing great joy.\u201d",
      "The Venice tribute, she added, was like \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d she said. \u201cI like cake, but icing is the best.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is sweeter in the world than appreciation,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel appreciated and you can\u2019t know how much that means.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s also looking forward to getting home and painting again. Every night at the festival she\u2019s found herself sketching and dreaming up ideas for more works.",
      "\u201cMy legacy is my art,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have my old movies, but you also have my new perspective on life. I do it all in my work and I want that to be my legacy. I want to get in a whole lot more paintings before I pass. So I can\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A three-hour film about the esoteric world of Kabuki is defying the odds at the Japanese box office, with tickets selling out at some cinemas.",
      "\u201cKokuho,\u201d which means \u201cnational treasure,\u201d has already grossed more than 10 billion yen ($68 million), making it the second-highest grossing Japanese live-action film of all time, and the first to achieve that in more than two decades.",
      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",
      "They look stunning, and convincing, having gone through months of training with a real Kabuki actor.",
      "Japan has submitted the film for the international feature category at the Academy Awards. The short list of the 15 films from which the final nominations come will be announced Dec. 16.",
      "\u201cKohuko\u201d got a favorable reception at the Cannes Film Festival. And it's been seen 7.4 million times in the first 73 days in Japanese theaters, many of them repeat viewers.",
      "The plot of \u201cKokuho\u201d \u2014 pronounced Koh-koo-hoe \u2014 explores perennial themes of family and the grueling hardships of being an artist, set to the backdrop of the intense but dreamlike life of the Kabuki actor.",
      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",
      "\u201cMany people can relate to the film,\u201d he added.",
      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "International officials say contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia could be the source of radioactive material behind recalls of imported shrimp",
      "Contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia may be the source of radioactive material that led to massive recalls of imported frozen shrimp, international nuclear safety officials say, as efforts are underway to halt more U.S.-bound shipments.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that officials are in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Indonesian nuclear regulators who have detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, at a processing plant that sent millions of pounds of shrimp to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPreliminary information suggests that it may have originated from activities at a metal melting facility at the same industrial site or from the disposal of scrap metal junk to other areas of the site,\u201d IAEA spokesperson Fredrik Dahl said in an email.",
      "No U.S. investigators have been sent to the site in Serang, west of Jakarta, federal officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the company that exported the shrimp, PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, also known as BMS Foods, has recalled more than 300 shipping containers that were already on their way to the U.S., Dahl said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",
      "This week, additional recalls were issued by Tampa Maid Foods LLC, of Florida, for breaded butterfly shrimp sold under Admiral of the Fleet, Portico Seafood Classic and other labels.",
      "None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.",
      "The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a \u201cpotential health concern\u201d for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.",
      "The FDA issued an import alert for shrimp from BMS Foods to stop the products from coming into the U.S.",
      "The company sent about 12 million pounds of shrimp to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia, in July and August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection records obtained by Import Genius, a trade data analysis company.",

      "The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA\u2019s level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.",
      "Still, it is unusual to see that concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, a nuclear medicine expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the contamination could have come from recycling old medical equipment that contained Cesium-137, Biegalski said. The material has been used in medical devices to reduce blood contamination and to treat cancer, for instance.",
      "When such equipment is no longer useful, it can be recycled. But if the Cesium-137 isn\u2019t properly removed, radioactive material can be released into the environment.",

      "BOSTON -- Massachusetts insurance carriers will be required to cover vaccinations recommended by the state\u2019s department of public health, whether or not those vaccines continue to be recommended by the federal government, Gov. Maura Healey announced Thursday.",
      "The Democratic governor issued a bulletin saying the move was to ensure Massachusetts residents can afford the vaccines they need and want, \u201ceven if the federal government issues narrower recommendations,\u201d according to a press release.",
      "The announcement comes after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s extensive restructuring and downsizing of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of former CDC Director Susan Monarez last month.",
      "\u201cMassachusetts has the best health care in the world,\u201d Healey said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t let Donald Trump and Robert Kennedy get between patients and their doctors.\"",
      "For decades, the CDC has set the nation\u2019s standards on vaccines \u2014 which ones are recommended and who should get them. The recommendations were guidance, not law. But they were automatically adopted by doctors, school systems, health insurers and others.",

      "A bill that would let Texas residents sue out-of-state abortion pill providers for up to $100,000 has been passed by lawmakers and sent to the governor",
      "Texas lawmakers on Wednesday approved letting private citizens sue abortion pill manufacturers, doctors and anyone who mails the medication, setting the state up to be the first to try to crack down on the most common abortion method.",
      "The law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.",
      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",
      "Under the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.",
      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",
      "The measure has provisions that bar making public the identity or medical details about a woman who receives the pills.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until those provisions were added, along with the limit of a $10,000 payment for people who aren\u2019t themselves injured by the abortion, that several major Texas anti-abortion groups backed the bill.",
      "Texas Right to Life, one of the state\u2019s most prominent anti-abortion groups, called it the \u201cstrongest pro-life law\u201d in the country.",
      "\u201cThis trend is killing tens of thousands of babies a year and harming their mothers, but today, our law became a blueprint for the rest of the country,\u201d said John Seago, the group\u2019s president.",
      "The idea of using citizens rather than government officials to enforce abortion bans is not new in Texas. It was at the heart of 2021 law that curtailed abortion there months before the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for other state bans to take effect.",
      "In the earlier law, citizens could collect $10,000 for bringing a successful lawsuit against a provider or anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion. But that measure didn\u2019t explicitly seek to go after out-of-state providers.",

      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",

      "Iran is paving over a lot in Tehran's largest cemetery believed to be the final resting place for some of the thousands killed in the mass executions that followed the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A desert-like patch of sand and scrawny trees in the largest cemetery in Iran's capital has been the final resting place for decades for some of the thousands killed in the mass executions that followed Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Now, Lot 41 at the sprawling Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran is becoming a parking lot, with their remains likely beneath asphalt.",
      "Images from Planet Labs PBC show the parking lot being laid over the site, where opponents of Iran's nascent theocracy and others were rapidly buried following their executions at gunpoint or by hanging.",
      "The site, long monitored by surveillance cameras searching for any sign of dissent or remembrance at what officials have referred to as the \u201cscorched section,\" has seen state-sponsored demolition in the past, with grave markers vandalized and overturned. Iranian officials have acknowledged the recent decision to build the parking, without going into detail about those buried there.",
      "That's as a United Nations special rapporteur in 2024 described Iran's destruction of graveyards as an effort to \u201cconceal or erase data that could serve as potential evidence to avoid legal accountability\u201d over its actions.",
      "\u201cMost of the graves and gravestones of dissidents were desecrated, and the trees in the section were deliberately dried out,\u201d said Shahin Nasiri, a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has researched Lot 41. \u201cThe decision to convert this section into a parking lot fits into this broader pattern and represents the final phase of the destruction process.\u201d",
      "Last week, both a Tehran deputy mayor and the cemetery\u2019s manager acknowledged the plans to create a parking lot on the site.",
      "\u201cIn this place, hypocrites of the early days of the revolution were buried and it has remained without change for years,\u201d Tehran's deputy mayor Davood Goudarzi told journalists in footage aired by state television. \"We proposed that the authorities reorganize the space. Since we needed a parking lot, the permission for the preparation of the space was received. The job is ongoing in a precise and smart way.\u201d",
      "The satellite photos show the work began in earnest at the start of August. An Aug. 18 image shows about half of Lot 41 freshly paved over, with construction material still on site. Trucks and piles of asphalt can be seen at the site, suggesting work continued.",
      "The reformist newspaper Shargh quoted Mohammad Javad Tajik, who oversees the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, as saying the parking lot would help people visit a neighboring lot, where authorities plan to bury those killed in the Iran-Israel war in June.",
      "A major airstrike campaign by Israel killed prominent military generals and others, with government officials putting the death toll at more than 1,060 people killed, with an activist group putting it at over 1,190.",
      "The decision to repurpose the graveyard appears to clash with Iran's own regulations, which allow for a cemetery to repurpose land where internments took place after more than 30 years \u2014 as long as families of the dead agree with the decision.",

      "\"The piece was not only for executed and political people. Ordinary people were buried there, too,\u201d he reportedly said.",
      "It remains unclear whether human remains sit beneath the layer of asphalt or if Iranian authorities moved the bones of the dead there. However, Iran has destroyed other graveyards in recent years for those killed in its 1988 mass execution that saw thousands put to death, leaving their bones there.",
      "Authorities have also vandalized cemeteries for the Baha'i, a religious minority in the country long targeted, and those home to protesters who have died in recent nationwide protests against Iran's theocracy from the 2009 Green Movement to the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations.",
      "\u201cImpunity for atrocities and crimes against humanity has been building for decades in the Islamic Republic,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran. \u201cThere is a direct line between the massacres of the 1980s, the gunning down of demonstrators in 2009, and the mass killings of protesters in 2019 and 2022.\"",
      "Behesht-e Zahra, or the \u201cParadise of Zahra,\u201d opened in 1970 on what was then the rural outskirts of Tehran. As hundreds of thousands of Iranians flooded into the capital under the shah as the country's oil wealth skyrocketed, pressure on Tehran's cemeteries had grown to a point that the burgeoning metropolis needed a place for all of its dead as well.",
      "The cemetery has long been a resting place for some of the most famous Iranians since \u2014 and a point where history turned for the country.",
      "On his return to Iran in 1979 after years in exile, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini traveled first to the cemetery, where some of those killed in the uprising against the shah had been buried. Khomeini's cleric courts later issued death sentences for those now interred at Lot 41.",
      "After his death in 1989, Iran built a towering, golden-domed mausoleum for Khomeini connected to the cemetery. As Behesht-e Zahra grew, Lot 41 found itself surrounded by an ever-expanding number of lots for burials.",
      "Nasiri said his research with others suggests there are 5,000 to 7,000 burial sites within Lot 41 of those Iran \u201cconsidered religious outlaws,\u201d whether communists, militants, monarchists or others.",
      "\u201cMany survivors and family members of the victims are still searching for the graves of their loved ones,\u201d Nasiri said. \u201cThey seek justice and aim to hold the perpetrators accountable. The deliberate destruction of these burial sites adds an additional obstacle to efforts of truth-finding and the pursuit of historical justice.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An expanding iron-ore mine and a deposit of rare-earth minerals are fragmenting the land in northern Sweden and altering ancient reindeer migration routes",
      "KIRUNA, Sweden -- High atop the Luossavaara Mountain in northern Sweden, Sami reindeer herder Lars-Marcus Kuhmunen mapped out a bleak future for himself and other Indigenous people whose reindeer have roamed this land for thousands of years.",
      "An expanding iron-ore mine and a deposit of rare-earth minerals are fragmenting the land and altering ancient reindeer migration routes. But with the Arctic warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, herders say they need more geographic flexibility, not less, to ensure the animals' survival.",
      "If a mine is established at the deposit of rare-earth minerals called Per Geijer, which Sweden heralds as Europe\u2019s largest, Kuhmunen said it could completely cut off the migration routes used by the Sami village of Gabna.",
      "That would be the end of the Indigenous way of life for Kuhmunen, his children and their fellow Sami reindeer herders, he said, in this far-north corner of Sweden some 200 kilometers (124 miles) above the Arctic Circle.",
      "\u201cThe reindeer is the fundamental base of the Sami culture in Sweden,\u201d Kuhmunen said. \u201cEverything is founded around the reindeers: The food, the language, the knowledge of mountains. Everything is founded around the reindeer herding. If that ceases to exist, the Sami culture will also cease to exist.\u201d",
      "Sami herders are descended from a once-nomadic people scattered across a region spanning the far north of Sweden, Norway, Finland and the northwestern corner of Russia. Until the 1960s, members of this Indigenous minority were discouraged from reindeer herding, and the church and state suppressed their language and culture.",
      "In Sweden alone there are at least 20,000 people with Sami heritage, though an official count does not exist because an ethnicity-based census is against the law. Today, a Sami village called a sameby is a business entity dictated by the state, which determines how many semi-domesticated reindeer each village can have and where they can roam.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more a problem to have a sort of sustainable reindeer husbandry and to be able to have the reindeers to survive the Arctic winter and into the next year,\u201d said Stefan Mikaelsson, a member of the Sami Parliament.",
      "In the Gabna village, Kuhmunen oversees about 2,500 to 3,000 reindeer and 15 to 20 herders. Their families, some 150 people in total, depend on the bottom line of the business.",
      "Even before the discovery of the Per Geijer deposit, they had to contend with the expanding footprint of Kiirunavaara. The world\u2019s largest underground, iron-ore mine has forced the village's herders to lead their reindeer through a longer and harder migration route.",
      "Swedish officials and LKAB, the state-owned mining company, say the proposed Per Geijer mine could reduce Europe's reliance on China for rare-earth minerals. LKAB hopes to begin mining there in the 2030s.",
      "Besides being essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles, rare-earth minerals also are considered crucial to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.",
      "But if work on Per Geijer goes forward, Kuhmunen said there will be no other routes for the Gabna herders to take the reindeer east from the mountains in the summer to the grazing pastures full of nutrient-rich lichen in the winter.",
      "The village will contest the mine in court but Kuhmunen said he is not optimistic.",
      "\u201cIt's really difficult to fight a mine. They have all the resources, they have all the means. They have the money. We don\u2019t have that,\" Kuhmunen said. \u201cWe only have our will to exist. To pass these grazing lands to our children.\"",

      "In the summer, mountain temperatures have risen to 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) and left reindeer over-heated and unable to graze enough to gain the weight needed to sustain them in winter.",
      "Some in Sweden suggest putting the reindeer onto trucks to ferry them between grazing lands if the Per Geijer mine is built. But Skarin said that isn't feasible because the animals eat on the move and the relocation would deny them food to be grazed while walking from one area to another.",
      "\u201cSo you\u2019re kind of both taking away the migration route that they have used traditionally over hundreds and thousands of years,\" she said, \"and you would also take away that forage resource that they should have used during that time.\u201d",

Of its rivals on the right, the Conservatives want it reduced and the Progress Party, which calls for lower taxes and more immigration controls, wants it scrapped. Previously a fringe issue, it has been at the heart of this campaign.",
      "Around 4.3 million people in the nation of some 5.6 million are eligible to vote for the new 169-member parliament, or Storting. Official results are expected on Tuesday. They are usually followed by weeks of horse-trading to form a coalition and agree on cabinet positions.",
      "The result isn\u2019t likely to have major implications for Norway\u2019s foreign policy. The country is a stalwart member of NATO and a strong supporter of Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia.",
      "The wealth tax is a levy of up to 1.1% on assets and shares worth more than 1.76 million kroner (around $176,000), though there are various reductions and discounts, for instance taking account of debt and property. Labor says that scrapping it would cost 34 billion kroner ($3.3 billion) per year.",
      "The Progress Party, which leads the right-wing coalition, is calling for the wealth tax to be abolished, arguing that it is detrimental to the economy. Party leader Sylvie Listhaug argues that it penalizes entrepreneurs who might have taxable stakes in valuable companies, but little real income.",
      "\u201cThe money paid in wealth tax could have been spent creating businesses, new jobs and more innovation,\u201d Listhaug wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",

      "Nigel Farage has made a bold pitch to his Reform UK party, echoing themes that helped Donald Trump rise to power",
      "LONDON -- The political pitch sounded familiar: The country is in crisis. The government must slash immigration, crack down on crime, ditch green energy targets and reopen factories to \u201cmake Britain great again.\u201d",
      "The words of Nigel Farage to his Reform UK party\u2019s two-day annual convention echoed themes that propelled U.S. President Donald Trump back to the White House.",
      "Farage, the veteran hard-right politician, hopes a similar strategy can make him prime minister \u2013 a once-unthinkable idea that allies and opponents alike are taking seriously.",
      "\u201cIf an election were held now, Reform would be the largest party by far, albeit probably short of an overall majority,\u201d John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, wrote on the BBC website. \u201cThe question hanging over the party is - can they sustain this?\u201d",
      "Farage played a major role in taking the U.K. out of the European Union in 2020, but has never held political power. He has led a succession of small, fractious parties and only became a lawmaker in 2024 after seven failed attempts to get elected to Parliament.",
      "Reform U.K. has only four lawmakers out of 650 in the House of Commons and got about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election. But for months it has led opinion polls, ahead of the center-left governing Labour Party and the main opposition Conservatives, which Reform aims to replace as Britain\u2019s major party on the political right.",
      "\u201cOur country is in a very bad place,\u201d Farage told delegates at the convention, which ends Saturday in Birmingham, central England. \u201cWe are the last chance the country has got to get this country back on track.\u201d",
      "Founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, Reform now claims to have 240,000 members. In May, it won control of a dozen local authorities in England with Trump-like promises like \u201ca DOGE for every county,\u201d inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s controversial spending-slashing agency.",
      "Farage made the most of Parliament\u2019s summer recess, when many politicians go on vacation, by holding regular news conferences to announce headline-grabbing policies like a plan to deport everyone who arrives in Britain without authorization.",
      "He has capitalized on \u2014 critics say stoked \u2014 concerns about migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, which he has called an invasion. He welcomed protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers over the summer, some of which turned violent.",
      "Opponents say Farage has demonized migrants and fueled misinformation. Last year, he inaccurately suggested police were withholding information about a stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three children dead. False claims that the attacker was an asylum-seeker sparked days of rioting across England.",
      "Reform\u2019s success in May\u2019s local elections has brought responsibilities that will test the party\u2019s competence and popularity.",
      "Some of the positions he shares with Trump, such as opposition to net-zero climate goals, are unpopular in Britain. Past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin could also be a disadvantage in a country where most people back Ukraine in its war against Moscow\u2019s invasion.",

      "Farage\u2019s depiction of Britain as a crime-ridden dystopia \u201cin societal breakdown\u201d has also met with skepticism.",
      "In Washington on Wednesday, Farage testified to the House Judiciary Committee about what he called the \u201cawful authoritarian situation\u201d and lack of free speech in the U.K., citing the arrest of TV comedy writer Graham Linehan for tweets attacking transgender people and the jailing of Lucy Connolly, a woman who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for a social media post urging people to burn down hotels full of asylum-seekers.",
      "\u201cAt what point did we become North Korea?\u201d Farage asked rhetorically.",
      "Farage was welcomed by Republicans on the committee, but was excoriated by Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin as a \u201cPutin-loving free speech impostor and Trump sycophant.\u201d In London, Prime Minister Keir Starmer noted Farage\u2019s absence from the House of Commons, saying that he had \u201cflown to America to badmouth and talk down our country.\u201d",
      "Both the Conservatives and Labour are struggling to respond to Reform\u2019s rise. Starmer has been criticized for not confronting the far-right party more strongly, instead seeming to agree with some of its talking points about immigration. In a May speech, Starmer said Britain risked becoming an \u201cisland of strangers,\u201d a phrase that some felt echoed Conservative politician Enoch Powell\u2019s notorious 1968 speech predicting \u201crivers of blood\u201d as a result of mass immigration.",
      "Starmer later said he regretted using the phrase.",
      "Political scientist Stuart Turnbull-Dugarte, who studied reaction to the speech, said Labour is \u201clegitimizing the immigration debate\u201d in a way that plays into Reform\u2019s hands and alienates its own supporters.",
      "\u201cAnti-immigration voters are not convinced by the turn, whereas pro-immigration voters are, and they\u2019re the ones who become really upset about it,\u201d said Turnbull-Dugarte, an associate professor at the University of Southampton.",
      "The media also comes in for criticism for amplifying Farage. The Green Party, which has the same number of lawmakers, receives a fraction of the attention. Reform is far ahead in opinion polls, however.",
      "The government does not have to call an election until 2029, and a lot can happen in four years.",
      "Farage said Friday that amid instability in Starmer\u2019s government, \u201cthere is every chance now of a general election happening in 2027, and we must be ready for that moment.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV has declared a 15-year-old computer whiz the Catholic Church\u2019s first millennial saint",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Leo XIV declared a 15-year-old computer whiz the Catholic Church\u2019s first millennial saint Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith and earn the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s influencer.\u201d",
      "Leo canonized Carlo Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. During the first saint-making Mass of his pontificate, Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \u201cmasterpieces\u201d out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\u201cThe greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God\u2019s plan,\u201d Leo said in his homily. The new saints \u201care an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\u201d",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "Acutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. He earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer,\u201d thanks to his main tech legacy: a multilingual website documenting so-called Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church, a project he completed at a time when the development of such sites was the domain of professionals.",
      "He was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day. The Catholic hierarchy has been trying to promote the practice of Eucharistic adoration because, according to polls, most Catholics don\u2019t believe Christ is physically present in the Eucharistic hosts.",
      "But Acutis limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones. That discipline and restraint has proved appealing to the Catholic hierarchy, which has sounded the alarm about the dangers of today's tech-driven society.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, Acutis fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",
      "In the years since his death, young Catholics have flocked by the millions to Assisi, where they can see the young Acutis through a glass-sided tomb, dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt. He seems as if he's sleeping, and questions have swirled about how his body was so well preserved, especially since parts of his heart have even toured the world as relics.",
      "Both saint-making ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but were postponed following Pope Francis\u2019 death in April. Francis had fervently pushed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to the faith while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like I can maybe not be as great as Carlo may be, but I can be looking after him and be like, \u2018What would Carlo do?\u2019\u201d said Leo Kowalsky, an 8th grader at a Chicago school attached to the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish.",
      "Kowalsky said he was particularly excited that his own namesake \u2014 Pope Leo \u2014 would be canonizing the patron of his school. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of all mashed up into one thing, so it is a joy to be a part of,\u201d Kowalsky said in an interview last week.",

      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints\u2019 enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.",
      "An hour before the Mass, St. Peter\u2019s Square was already full with pilgrims, many of them young millennial Italians, many with toddlers in strollers.",
      "\u201cI learned from different people what his professors, his teachers said about his joy and the light he carried around him,\u201d said Leopoldo Antimi, a 27-year-old Roman who got to the square early to secure a spot. \u201cSo for me personally as an Italian, even on social networks that are used so much, it is important to have him as an influencer.\u201d",
      "Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross college in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.",
      "\u201cHe becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,\u201d he said in statement. \u201cHe is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.\u201d",
      "Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Voters across Argentina\u2019s most populous province of Buenos Aires headed to the polls on Sunday to choose lawmakers in an unusually high-stakes local election seen as a referendum on the performance of libertarian President Javier Milei and a bellwether for crucial midterms next month.",
      "The Buenos Aires provincial election is polarized between Milei\u2019s recently formed libertarian party and Peronism, the ideologically flexible populist movement that has held sway in Argentina for decades.",
      "Milei, whose barely 4-year-old La Libertad Avanza party has subsumed much of the center-right, views this a chance to embarrass the Peronist opposition led by former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in its historic stronghold.",
      "\u201cThese elections will be useful to understand the level of support that the government has but also how strong the Peronist party is, especially ahead of October midterms where the government needs a good result to push its reforms,\u201d said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, the head of Cefeidas Group, a consultancy in Buenos Aires.",
      "But the test comes at a tough time.",
      "A bribery scandal has rocked the nation, entangling Milei\u2019s politically powerful sister and undercutting the president\u2019s image as a political outsider pitted against the corrupt Peronist elite. Milei denies the allegations that his sister took kickbacks from pharmaceutical contracts.",
      "The opposition-dominated Congress has started to turn against Milei\u2019s harsh cuts to social programs, overriding his veto on raising disability benefits and approving bills that boost scant funding for healthcare and universities.",
      "Adding to the pressure, Argentina\u2019s economy is shrinking, consumer confidence is falling, unemployment is rising and interest rates are soaring to record highs as the government repeatedly intervenes in the currency market to prop up the peso and hold down inflation in hopes of placating cash-strapped voters.",
      "As a result, Milei hasn\u2019t built up enough foreign currency reserves to assure global markets that he can make good on his promise to transform this nine-time serial defaulter into a normal country capable of servicing its debts.",
      "\u201cMilei has a very strong ideology, and his vision is that the state has to have a minimal impact and investments have to come from the private sector. But that hasn\u2019t materialized yet,\u201d said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine political analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO.",

      "Despite the headwinds, Milei has a few assets in his favor: He has fulfilled his flagship campaign pledge to bring down Argentina\u2019s sky-high inflation rate. And his rivals \u2014 whose reckless spending helped deliver the crisis that he inherited \u2014 are in disarray.",
      "Former President Fern\u00e1ndez, who pulled Peronism to the left during her 2007-2015 tenure and remains its most powerful leader, has been banned from politics for life and placed under house arrest over a corruption conviction.",
      "The party\u2019s future leadership remains uncertain. The movement has struggled to articulate a clear political vision beyond opposition to Milei or economic policy beyond the same patchwork of price controls and cash handouts.",
      "Nonetheless, a sputtering economy and ballooning government corruption scandal has given a jolt of optimism to Peronists in the province where Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, the charismatic army general and grandmaster of 20th century Argentine politics, first built his working-class base in the 1940s.",
      "\u201cRight now, people don\u2019t have a lot of options in front of them,\u201d said Iparraguirre. \u201cThey may be disillusioned with Milei. But they don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of admirers and VIPs have paid their respects to Giorgio Armani, who passed away Thursday at 91",
      "MILAN -- Hundreds of ordinary admirers and VIPs paid their last respects Saturday to Giorgio Armani, remembered by Milan\u2019s mayor as a \u201cman of extraordinary elegance\u201d who left an indelible mark on the city and the global fashion world.",
      "Armani died Thursday at 91 at his home in central Milan surrounded by loved ones. His fashion house said he worked up to the end. One of his final projects was a runway show marking 50 years of his signature Giorgio Armani brand, which is due to close Milan Fashion Week later this month.",
      "Mourners filed into the Armani Theater, where Armani regularly showed his ready-to-wear runway collections. Rows of candles in paper bags cast a shimmering light and piano music by Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi played softly in the background. The closed coffin was adorned with a bouquet of long-stem white roses, and flanked by carabinieri honor guards in ceremonial dress.",
      "Among them was including Donatella Versace, who wore a dark skirt suit and carried a bouquet of white flowers, which she left in tribute. She left without making any remarks.",
      "A sculpture featuring a crucifix on a raw block of marble stood nearby, brought from Armani's bedside.",
      "Armani, who was deeply private, was not known to be a practicing Catholic, but a priest who emerged from his central Milan home after his death told reporters that he attended Mass daily.",
      "Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala was among the first to arrive, offering condolences to Leo Dell\u2019Orco, Armani\u2019s longtime collaborator and the head of menswear, who stood near the coffin.",
      "\u201cA man of extraordinary elegance,\u2019\u2019 Sala told reporters outside. \u201cMilan is full of signs of Armani. It will be impossible to forget him.\u201d",
      "Sala remembered a phone call from Armani in early August, when news of a corruption scandal in the city broke.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I understand this is a difficult moment. There is always something positive in difficult moments. True friends show themselves. I am your true friend.' This I will always remember,\u2019\u2019 Sala said.",
      "Annamaria Longo Dorni traveled more than two hours from Lago Maggiore, north of Milan, to pay her last respects wearing an Armani midnight blue jacket for the occasion.",

      "Argentines have been captivated by a growing corruption scandal involving President Javier Milei's close associates",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentines are so used to the corruption in their political system that even Peronists \u2014 supporters of the populist movement that dominated Argentina\u2019s politics for decades \u2014 employ a fatalistic maxim to describe their politicians: \u201cRoban, pero hacen,\u201d or, \u201cThey steal, but they get it done.\u201d",
      "But for the past two weeks, Argentines have been riveted by a ballooning graft scandal drawing in close associates of libertarian President Javier Milei, the wild-haired economist who won Argentina's 2023 election in part by campaigning as an outsider against the corrupt, Peronist-dominated elite \u2014 \u201cthe caste,\u201d he calls it \u2014 whose unbridled spending helped precipitate Argentina\u2019s economic crisis.",
      "At a time of extreme fiscal austerity, the allegations that his powerful sister and chief of staff, Karina Milei, profited from a kickback scheme in Argentina\u2019s disability agency have exploded onto the headlines here, threatening to sully the government\u2019s reputation ahead of national midterms at the end of October. Milei denies the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt appears to be very similar to many other corruption scandals in Argentina, and taints his image as being completely different, of not being part of \u2018the caste,\u2019\u201d said Eugenia Mitchelstein, the chair of the social sciences department at Buenos Aires\u2019 San Andr\u00e9s University.",
      "The scandal broke out last month when local streaming channel Carnaval published secretly recorded audio clips purporting to show Diego Spagnuolo, then-director of the National Disability Agency, describe a scheme of kickbacks from drug distributor Suizo Argentina.",
      "The alleged voice of Spagnuolo claims that top officials \u2014 including Milei's sister Karina and her senior aide, Eduardo \u201cLule\u201d Menem \u2014 accepted bribes of $500,000 and $800,000 in exchange for government pharmaceutical contracts. The voice says Karina Milei takes kickbacks of 3-4% of the contract price.",
      "\u201cI told him, \u2018Javier, you know they\u2019re stealing, that your sister is stealing,\u2019\u201d the alleged Spagnuolo can be heard saying.",
      "It's not clear who captured the audio or when. Based on references to political events in the recordings, local media have reported that the conversations occurred over several months starting in August 2024.",
      "The leak appeared timed to have maximum impact, rocking Milei's government before Sunday\u2019s provincial elections in Buenos Aires, the country\u2019s most populous province and a historic Peronist opposition stronghold.",
      "The audio also surfaced soon after Milei vetoed an increase in benefits for people with disabilities, arguing it would jeopardize his much-vaunted fiscal surplus.",
      "\u201cCorruption scandals at times of economic scarcity tend to have a bigger impact,\" said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine political analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO. \u201cIt's hitting hard at Milei's potential to grow beyond his base.\u201d",
      "The typically voluble Milei kept silent about the recordings for six days after their release.",
      "Within hours of the leak, he sacked Spagnuolo, who was also his personal lawyer. A federal judge ordered raids at offices and homes belonging to Spagnuolo and Suizo Argentina executives.",
      "Under pressure, Milei\u2019s officials contested the veracity of the recordings and accused the political opposition of orchestrating the scandal to undermine the government's electoral prospects.",
      "Peppered with questions at a campaign caravan last Wednesday, Milei snapped, saying, \u201cEverything (Spagnuolo) says is a lie.\u201d The rally devolved into chaos as protesters threw stones at his motorcade.",
      "The next day Mieli offered a full-throated defense of his sister, condemning all the allegations as political theater.",

      "Just as Milei seemed to reclaim control of the narrative, recordings emerged of Karina Milei speaking to officials inside her private office at the Casa Rosada presidential palace.",
      "The same journalist at Carnaval who released the Spagnuolo recordings published two brief and innocuous audio clips \u2014 one in which Karina Milei can be heard urging colleagues to \u201cstay united\u201d and another in which she complains of working from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. each day.",
      "The journalist, Mauro Federico, claimed he had 50 minutes of recordings that he was prepared to release, prompting full-fledged panic in the presidency.",
      "Manuel Adorni, Milei's spokesperson, said the conversations were \u201cillegally recorded\u201d and denounced the leak as \u201can illegal intelligence operation intended to destabilize the country.\"",

      "The Russian Embassy was not pleased. \u201cThe desire to see \u2018Russian spies\u2019 around every corner is irrational and destructive,\" it said.",
      "Analysts say a key factor limiting Milei\u2019s ability to quash the scandal is the involvement Karina Milei, his sister and close confidant since childhood who now acts as his gatekeeper. The president has compared her to Moses and regularly refers to her as \u201cEl Jefe,\u201d the Spanish masculine form for \u201cthe boss.\"",
      "A former Instagram cake-baker and tarot card reader, Karina Milei successfully managed her unmarried brother\u2019s presidential campaign before becoming general secretary \u2014 a catch-all title under which she controls the president\u2019s agenda, chooses staff for top government roles and essentially runs his libertarian political party.",
      "It's not the first time that she has been mired in scandal. Milei's reputation took a hit earlier this year after he promoted a memecoin called Libra that crashed hours later, saddling investors with over $250 million in losses.",
      "The coin's creator bragged in text messages that he was paying Karina Milei to advance his crypto-ambitions. Milei and his sister have denied any wrongdoing. Class-action lawsuits filed by investors are crawling through U.S. courts.",
      "As fallout from the audio scandal spreads, Karina Milei has increasingly become the target of public outrage \u2014 evacuated from two consecutive campaign events in Buenos Aires last week.",
      "A catchy jingle \u2014 first sung on a popular streaming channel to the tune of \u201cGuantanamera\u201d \u2014 has gone viral, belted out at Buenos Aires nightclubs in recent days.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s Prince Hisahito is the first male royal to reach adulthood in 40 years. He could also be the last.",
      "The elaborate palace rituals to formally recognize Hisahito as an adult on Saturday are a reminder of the bleak outlook for the world's oldest monarchy. Much of this comes down to its male-only succession policy and dwindling numbers.",
      "Hisahito is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne and is likely to become emperor one day. After him, however, there is nobody left, leaving the Imperial family with a dilemma over whether they should reverse a 19th century ruling that abolished female succession.",
      "A freshman at Tsukuba University near Tokyo, Hisahito studies biology and enjoys playing badminton. He is especially devoted to dragonflies and has co-authored an academic paper on a survey of the insects on the grounds of his Akasaka estate in Tokyo.",
      "In his debut news conference in March, the prince said he hopes to focus his studies on dragonflies and other insects, including ways to protect bug populations in urban areas.",
      "Hisahito was born on Sept. 6, 2006, and is the only son of Crown Prince Akishino, the heir to the throne, and his wife, Crown Princess Kiko. He has two older sisters, the popular Princess Kako and former Princess Mako, whose marriage to a nonroyal required her to abandon her royal status.",
      "Hisahito\u2019s coming-of-age rituals fall a year after he turned 18, reaching legal adulthood, because he wanted to concentrate on college entrance exams.",
      "Hisahito is the nephew of Emperor Naruhito, who has one child, a daughter, Princess Aiko. Hisahito's father, Akishino, the Emperor's younger brother, was the last male to reach adulthood in the family, in 1985.",
      "Hisahito is the youngest of the 16-member all-adult Imperial Family. He and his father are the only two male heirs who are younger than Naruhito. Prince Hitachi, former Emperor Akihito's younger brother, is third in line to the throne but is already 89.",
      "The shortage of male successors is a serious concern for the monarchy, which historians say has lasted for 1,500 years. The issue reflects Japan\u2019s rapidly aging and shrinking population.",
      "Japan traditionally had male emperors, but female succession was permitted. There have been eight female emperors, including the most recent Gosakuramachi who ruled from 1762 to 1770. None of them, however, produced an heir during their reign.",
      "Succession was legally limited to males by the prewar Constitution for the first time in 1889. The postwar 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, also only allows male succession.",
      "But experts say the male-only succession system is structurally flawed and only worked previously thanks to the help of concubines who, until about 100 years ago, produced imperial children.",

      "To address succession concerns, the government compiled a proposal to allow a female emperor in 2005. But Hisahito's birth quickly changed the tide and nationalists turned against the proposal.",
      "A separate, largely conservative panel of experts in January 2022 recommended calling on the government to maintain its male-line succession while allowing female members to keep their royal status after marriage and continue their official duties. The conservatives also proposed adopting male descendants from now-defunct distant royal families to continue the male lineage.",
      "But the debate has stalled over the question of whether to give royal status to nonroyals who marry princesses and their children.",
      "The stalled debate has forced Hisahito to carry the burden of the Imperial Family's fate by himself, former Imperial Household Agency chief Shingo Haketa said in a Yomiuri newspaper article earlier this year. \u201cThe fundamental question is not whether to allow male or female succession line but how to save the monarchy.\u201d",
      "The conservative Yomiuri issued its own proposal in May, calling for an urgent revision to the Imperial House Law to give royal status to husbands and children of princesses and allow women to succeed the throne. It called on the parliament to \u201cresponsibly reach a conclusion on the crisis surrounding the state and the symbol of the unity of the people.\u201d",
      "Saturday's ritual for Hisahito was to start at his family residence, with him appearing in a tuxedo to receive a crown to be delivered by a messenger from Naruhito. He then was to put on traditional attire which symbolizes his pre-adulthood status to visit the Imperial Palace to perform a crown-wearing ritual.",
      "After changing into a costume which symbolizes adulthood, he is scheduled to ride in a royal horse carriage to pray at the three shrines within the palace compound.",
      "In the afternoon, Hisahito will put his tuxedo back on to visit the Imperial Palace to greet Naruhito and Empress Masako in the prestigious Matsu-no-Ma, or pine room. In another ritual he is to receive a medal, the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum, in a postwar tradition. He will also greet his grandparents, Akihito and his wife, former Empress Michiko, at their palace.",
      "In the evening, Akishino and Kiko will host a private celebration for their son at a Tokyo hotel where their relatives will gather.",
      "The rituals also include his visits early next week to Ise, Japan's top Shinto shrine, the mausoleum of the mythical first emperor Jinmu in Nara, as well as that of his late great-grandfather, wartime emperor Hirohito, in the Tokyo suburbs. He will also have lunch with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and other dignitaries Wednesday.",

      "The head of Greece's government traditionally outlines the following year\u2019s economic policies at the fair every September, while touting their achievements.",
      "At last year\u2019s speech, Mitsotakis had declared \u201cI have not come with a bag full of gifts.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s speech was mostly about gifts designed to boost as many incomes as possible. Mitsotakis himself put the beneficiaries \u2014 the middle class, the young, large families, pensioners and others \u2014 at around 4 million.",
      "This was not a pork barrel fest, yet it was clear that Mitsotakis was speaking with the next national election in mind. The election must take place by July 2027.",
      "The tax-cut package was limited by spending constraints imposed by the EU, but financed by better-than-expected tax revenue and a primary budget surplus, which excludes debt servicing.",
      "The tax cuts will be incorporated in the 2026 national budget, which will be voted on by Parliament in December.",
      "Other than the lowest tax bracket, 9%, and the top rate of 44%, all other tax rates will be cut by 2 percentage points \u2014 more for families, especially those with three or more children. A new 39% rate will be imposed on incomes from 40-60,000 euros ($46,800 - $70,200) that now pay the top rate.",

Income earners from rents will also pay significantly less, although Mitsotakis noted the incomes they declare from that source are almost absurdly low. Residents of small islands \u2014 under 20,000 population \u2014 will pay 30% less in value added tax, while village residents will see property taxes much reduced over the next two years.",

At 1.4 children per woman, the birthrate is well below the replacement level of 2.1. At this rate, the population will drop from a current 10.2 million to well under 8 million by 2050.

      "\u201cThe discovery of human remains was very important in letting the country know that we are not crazy, that we are not liars,\u201d said Galeano, a spokesperson for Women Walking for Truth, an organization for victims of forced disappearances in Medellin founded in 2022.",
      "These families have come to symbolize the search for the more than 120,000 people who disappeared in Colombia between 1985 and 2016.",
      "Galeano is searching for her husband, Luis Javier Laverde Salazar, whom she last saw on Dec. 9, 2008. Their last contact was a phone call in which he told her he would be home for dinner. She believes he is buried in La Escombrera and was disappeared by paramilitaries.",
      "La Escombrera sits on a steep hillside in the Comuna 13 district, a once strategic location for moving drugs and weapons. At the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, it was fought over by guerrillas and paramilitaries \u2014 groups that emerged to combat the leftist insurgents\u2014 with the latter eventually gaining control in the early 2000s.",
      "Between 2001 and 2004, Colombian security forces carried out 34 military operations in Comuna 13 in an attempt to take control. Some of these operations have come under scrutiny due to alleged human rights violations against the civilian population, which have been denounced by victims and are now being investigated by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.",
      "\u201cLa Escombrera was a paramilitary base since at least mid-2002,\u201d said Justice Gustavo Salazar, who is leading the investigation with the special tribunal. \"People detained by these groups were taken there to be interrogated, tortured, or simply killed and buried, under the belief that their bodies would never be found.\u201d",
      "According to Salazar, the peak period of disappearances in 2002 aligns with the paramilitaries\u2019 dominance in the area. At the same time, construction waste was being dumped at La Escombrera, a site once used to extract sand before being filled with rubble. While he believes the paramilitaries are the likely perpetrators, he doesn't rule out the possibility that other illegal groups also concealed bodies there.",
      "Former paramilitaries, who have taken part in the peace process since 2003, have admitted to killing and burying people in La Escombrera. They were later convicted.",

      "Carol disappeared on Oct. 25, 2002, during Operacion Orion, a military operation in Comuna 13 carried out by police, soldiers and aerial support at the start of the administration of then- President \u00c1lvaro Uribe.",
      "The discovery of human remains in La Escombrera ignited a debate in Colombia. The conservative party Centro Democr\u00e1tico defended Uribe\u2019s security policy and Operation Orion, arguing the disappearances didn\u2019t happen then and accusing the peace tribunal of political opportunism. In contrast, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first left-wing leader, saw it as confirmation of the state and paramilitary violence he has long condemned.",
      "Restrepo's fear was reignited in July when two bodies were discovered in La Escombrera. One, she was told, belonged to a young woman between 16 and 18 years old who had \u201cperfect teeth,\u201d a detail that matches her memory of her daughter.

Because of the lack of privacy and close quarters, the woman and children sleep inside, with the men bedding down outside in the courtyard.",

Israel intervened on the side of the Druze, launching airstrikes.",
      "Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed and Sweida has remained under what residents describe as a siege since then, with limited aid and supplies going in.

      "Many of the pilgrims attributed their feeling of welcome to Francis. More than any of his predecessors, Francis distinguished himself with a message of welcome, from his 2013 quip, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d about a purportedly gay priest, to his decision to allow priests to bless same-sex couples.",
      "He never changed church teaching saying homosexual acts are \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d But during his 12-year papacy from 2013 to 2025, Francis met with LGBTQ+ advocates, ministered to a community of trans women and, in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, declared that \u201cbeing homosexual is not a crime.\u201d",
      "John Capozzi of Washington D.C., who was participating in the pilgrimage with his husband, del Rosario, said Francis\u2019 attitude brought him back to the church after he left it in the 1980s, at the height of the AIDS crisis. Then, he said, he felt shunned by his fellow Catholics.",
      "\u201cThere was that feeling like I wasn\u2019t welcome in the church,\u201d he said. \u201cNot because I was doing anything, just because I was who I was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was this fear of going back in because of the judgment.\u201d",

      "Lauren McChesney got more than admission to a double feature when she handed her ticket to Matt McClanahan at a different drive-in he managed in 2018. They started dating a year later, and, in August, got engaged. In between, they purchased Shankweiler\u2019s Drive-In Theatre, which was Pennsylvania\u2019s first drive-in and only the nation\u2019s second when it opened in 1934.",
      "The couple began brainstorming about drive-ins during a cross-country road trip that included stops at both operational and abandoned theaters. Their original goal was to open a new drive-in, but when they learned Shankweiler's might get sold to developers, \u201cthe light bulb went off,\u201d McClanahan said.",
      "\u201cWhy are we spending so much time trying to build one when there\u2019s one literally down the road from our house that\u2019s for sale and is like the most important drive-in?\u201d he said.",
      "The drive-in movie theater industry began in Camden, New Jersey, in 1933 and peaked in the late 1950s, with more than 4,000 drive-ins, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association. The numbers dropped rapidly in the 1970s and 80s as other entertainment options increased, along with land values that made selling for redevelopment attractive. Though popular during the pandemic, by 2024, there were only 283 left, according to the association.",
      "McClanahan, 35, who grew up going to Shankweiler\u2019s, had managed another drive-in and started a mobile movie business during the coronavirus pandemic. In contrast, McChesney, 41, had never been to a drive-in before 2018, and she left a stable corporate job in the health care industry to take on this new venture. Buying Shankweiler's was a risk for both of them \u2014 they pooled their savings and secured a $1 million loan to buy the drive-in in 2022 \u2014 but one they say has paid off.",
      "\u201cThis was an undertaking that was leaps and bounds bigger than anything I\u2019d ever done in my life, in terms of investment, monthly expenses, and debt,\u201d McClanahan said. \u201cIt still feels surreal when I think about it.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve built a successful business with the help of strong summer attendance, the occasional big-name film like \u201cWicked,\u201d and special events like Valentine\u2019s Day \u201cdate night\u201d screenings of \u201cThe Notebook.\u201d The drive-in is open seven days a week from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and Thursdays through Sundays the rest of the year. Tickets are $9 for children and $13 for adults.",
      "Ken Querio, 52, of Kutztown, Pennsylvania, has been going to Shankweiler\u2019s since he was a teenager. He made a point to seek out the owners before a recent viewing of \u201cJaws.\u201d",

      "Friday's jobs report showed employers added a mere 22,000 jobs in August, as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%. Factories and construction firms shed workers. Revisions showed the economy lost 13,000 jobs in June, the first monthly losses since December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "The plea for patience has done little to comfort Americans, as economic issues that had been a strength for Trump for a decade have evolved into a persistent weakness.

Investors expect a rate cut by the Fed at its next meeting in September, although that\u2019s partially because of weakening job numbers.",

      "\u2014 At his April tariffs announcement, Trump said, \u201cJobs and factories will come roaring back into our country and you see it happening already.\u201d Since April, manufacturers have cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",

But the logging and mining sectors \u2014 which includes oil and natural gas \u2014 have shed 12,000 jobs since January. While gasoline prices are lower, the Energy Information Administration in August estimated that crude oil production, the source of the wealth promised by Trump, would fall next year by an average of 100,000 barrels a day.",
      "\u2014 At 2024 rallies, Trump promised to \u201cend\u201d inflation on \u201cday one\u201d and halve electricity prices within 12 months. Consumer prices have climbed from a 2.3% annual increase in April to 2.7% in July. Electricity costs are up 4.6% so far this year.",

      "The Trump administration is taking the fight over tariffs to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to rule quickly that the president has the power to impose sweeping import taxes under federal law",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration took the fight over tariffs to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking the justices to rule quickly that the president has the power to impose sweeping import taxes under federal law.",
      "The government called on the court to reverse an appeals court ruling that found most of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are an illegal use of an emergency powers law.",
      "It's the latest in a series of Trump administration appeals to a Supreme Court he helped shape, and one that is expected to put a centerpiece of the president's trade policy before the justices.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left the tariffs in place for now, but the administration nevertheless called on the high court to intervene quickly in a petition filed electronically late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press. It was expected to be formally docketed on Thursday.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to take up the case and hear arguments in early November.",
      "\u201cThat decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe stakes in this case could not be higher.\u201d",
      "But the stakes are also high for small businesses battered by tariffs and uncertainty, said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.",
      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he said.",
      "The businesses have twice prevailed, once at a federal court focused on trade and again with the appeals court's 7-4 ruling.",
      "Their lawsuit is one of several challenging the tariffs and erratic rollout that have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "But Trump has also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",

      "Most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, did not let Trump usurp congressional power to set tariffs. The dissenters, though, said the law does allow the president to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations.",
      "The ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.",
      "Some Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, weren\u2019t covered by the appeals court ruling. It also does not include tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "The government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it\u2019s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.",

      "NEW YORK -- Paul Colford, an inexhaustibly curious journalist and author who covered the media business for decades before seeing it from another vantage point as The Associated Press' chief spokesperson, has died. He was 71.",
      "Colford, who retired from the AP in 2017, died Aug. 26 after a fall the previous month turned a long struggle with Parkinson's disease into a rapid decline, said his wife, Anne LaBate. Despite his health problems, he was working even in recent months on his third book, about a notorious figure from his hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey.",
      "During a decade as AP's director and ultimately vice president of media relations, Colford was known for his sage, unflappable handling of the news cooperative's dealings with other media outlets, from requests for interviews with its journalists to inquiries about its practices.",
      "\u201cPaul was both graceful and tough and believed completely in the AP\u2019s journalists and their mission. That was important during some pretty tough moments, particularly when an AP journalist was hurt or worse,\" said Kathleen Carroll, who was the news service's executive editor from 2002 to 2016. She recalled Colford as \u201ca talented and classy colleague\u201d who loved journalism.",
      "Colford knew the media ecosystem from the inside out and the outside in, having been a media reporter and columnist for the Daily News of New York, Newsday and the former New York Newsday. He covered magazines, book publishing, newspapers' digital evolution and the new media of the dot-com era. Reporting on the radio landscape as conservative talk rose to prominence, Colford penned unauthorized biographies of Rush Limbaugh and shock jock Howard Stern.",
      "\u201cHe just was indefatigable,\u201d said longtime Newsday TV writer and critic Verne Gay, a colleague and friend of Colford's. \u201cHe vacuumed everything up. He knew everything and everybody. And he constantly broke stories on the beat.... I was just in awe of him.\"",
      "Born Sept. 24, 1953, in Jersey City, Colford grew up there with seven siblings and graduated in 1975 from St. Peter's University. He spent part of his college years studying in Turin, Italy, and still spoke Italian in phone calls with friends from that time, his wife said.",
      "His early jobs included a stint at The Courier News of central New Jersey, where the couple met and dated for a time in the 1970s. He took her to the first Shakespeare in the Park production she ever attended, she recalled.",
      "The relationship fizzled, Colford went on to New York Newsday and later the Daily News, and he married the late Jane Colford and had two children, Catherine and Liam. He and LaBate still had ties through friends and family, and they got back together after he was widowed.",
      "\u201cWe certainly both had lived whole lives\u201d in the meantime, she said, but \u201cit was probably even a clearer connection.\u201d They married in 2022.",
      "Colford's professional life also had evolved. He took the AP's media relations job in 2007.",

      "The job, in a 24/7 global news operation, is not easy. Tom Kent, who was AP's standards editor during much of Colford's tenure, recalled him as invaluable in responding to public controversies that erupted at times over its reports.",
      "As editors debated, readers and viewers complained and other news outlets called for comment, Colford kept his cool and gave smart guidance about how best to react, said Kent, now a consultant. He said editors and executives ended up taking Colford's advice, which came with \u201ca journalistic sensitivity and ethical integrity that won the confidence and respect of journalists and editors across the AP.\u201d",
      "Lauren Easton, whom Colford hired in a junior role, is now an AP vice president overseeing global communications. She said he was \u201ca fierce defender of The Associated Press, always stepping up to advocate for press freedom, access and the importance of factual, nonpartisan journalism.\u201d",

And he worked on his book, amassing a new batch of news clippings and other research in his home office in Trenton, N.J., said Gay, who visited him in June.",

      "A midstage study of the psychedelic drug LSD showed positive results for easing symptoms in people with generalized anxiety disorder",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 LSD reduced symptoms of anxiety in a midstage study published Thursday, paving the way for additional testing and possible medical approval of a psychedelic drug that has been banned in the U.S. for more than a half century.",
      "The results from drugmaker Mindmed tested several doses of LSD in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder, with the benefits lasting as long as three months. The company plans to conduct follow-up studies to confirm the results and then apply for Food and Drug Administration approval.",
      "Beginning in the 1950s, researchers published a flurry of papers exploring LSD's therapeutic uses, though most of them don't meet modern standards.",
      "\u201cI see this paper as a clear step in the direction of reviving that old research, applying our modern standards and determining what are the real costs and benefits of these compounds,\u201d said Frederick Barrett, who directs Johns Hopkins University\u2019s psychedelic center and was not involved in the research.",
      "Psychedelics are in the midst of a popular and scientific comeback, with conferences, documentaries, books and medical journals exploring their potential for conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

      "Still, the drugs have not had a glide path to the market.",
      "Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA \u2014 also known as ecstasy \u2014 as a treatment for PTSD, citing flawed study methods, potential research bias and other issues.",
      "The new LSD study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, addresses some of those problems.",
      "MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy.",
      "The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD \u2014 under professional supervision, but without therapy \u2014 and then were followed for about three months.",
      "The paper does not detail how patients were prepared for the experience or what sort of follow-up they received, which is crucial to understanding the research, Barrett noted.",
      "\u201cIn many cases people can have such powerful, subjective experiences that they may need to talk to a therapist to help them make sense of it,\u201d he said.",
      "For the study, researchers measured anxiety symptoms in nearly 200 patients who randomly received one of four doses of LSD or a placebo. The main aim was to find the optimal dose of the drug, which can cause intense visual hallucinations and occasionally feelings of panic or paranoia.",
      "At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose \u2014 100 milligrams \u2014 continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches.",
      "Patients who got dummy pills also improved \u2014 a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies \u2014 but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug.",

      "The research was not immune to problems seen in similar studies.",
      "Most patients were able to correctly guess whether they\u2019d received LSD or a dummy pill, undercutting the \u201cblinded\u201d approach that\u2019s considered critical to objectively establishing the benefits of a new medicine. In addition, a significant portion of patients in both the placebo and treatment groups dropped out early, narrowing the final data set.",
      "It also wasn\u2019t clear how long patients might continue to benefit.",
      "Mindmed is conducting two large, late-stage trials that will track patients over a longer period of time and, if successful, be submitted for FDA approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that some people may need retreatment,\u201d said Dr. Maurizio Fava of Mass General Brigham Hospital, the study's lead author and an adviser to Mindmed. \"How many retreatments, we don\u2019t know yet, but the long-lasting effect is quite significant.\"",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other administration officials have expressed interest in psychedelic therapy, suggesting it could receive fast-track review for veterans and others suffering psychological wounds.",
      "Generalized anxiety disorder is among the most common mental disorders, affecting nearly 3% of U.S. adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Current treatments include psychotherapy, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.",
      "The possibility of using LSD as a medical treatment isn\u2019t new.",
      "In the 1950s and 1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting LSD's use treating alcohol addiction, depression and other conditions. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to \u201cturn on, tune in and dropout.\u201d",
      "A 1970 law classifying LSD and other psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs \u2014 without any medical use and high potential for abuse \u2014 essentially halted U.S. research.",
      "When a handful of nonprofits begin reassessing the drugs in the 1980s and 1990s, they focused on lesser-known hallucinogens like MDMA and psilocybin, the main ingredient in magic mushrooms, to avoid the historic controversies surrounding LSD.",
      "\u201cLSD was right there in front of everybody, but Mindmed is the first company that actually decided to evaluate it,\u201d Fava said.",

      "The trend of ditching traditional office space to work from living rooms and hotels accelerated when the coronavirus hit in 2020",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kate Smith worked a 9-to-5 office job, she was burned-out, suffering from daily migraines and thinking, \u201cI can't do this for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "She didn't have to. For her next role, Smith landed a remote, full-time marketing job that enabled her to travel the world.",
      "Her laptop lifestyle took her to Bali, where she lived and worked for a year-and-a-half. \u201cEvery day, I was riding my scooter through the rice fields and thinking, \u2018I love my life, this is amazing,'\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that feeling never fades. ... I feel so grateful for the freedom and flexibility.\u201d",
      "While Smith, 36, has worked remotely for more than a decade, the trend of ditching traditional office spaces to work from living rooms or beachfront shacks accelerated in 2020, when the coronavirus hit and workers who could began performing their jobs from home.",
      "Many people grew accustomed to the lifestyle change once they tasted the freedom and flexibility a home office afforded. Working parents enjoyed meeting children at the school bus. Others found more time for exercise, socializing and basking in nature once their jobs did not include long commutes.",
      "But after the pandemic subsided, many large companies began calling employees back into the office, creating fierce competition for jobs that could be done from anywhere. Many positions advertised as remote attract hundreds, if not more than a thousand, of applications, experts said.",
      "\u201cFully remote is very rare now in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Ma, associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt is getting much more difficult and you need to look for the smaller firms or medium-sized firms ... and those firms do not provide as competitive financial packages as the big firms, but they try to attract talent by providing more flexibility.\u201d",
      "About 9% of paid U.S. job postings on social networking platform LinkedIn in July offered remote work, while those types of roles attracted 37% of applications, according to the company.",
      "Below, employers and people who haven't returned to an office offer advice on how to land remote jobs in a competitive climate.",

This is how much I\u2019ve built in a period of time,\u2019\u201d said Rover, who mostly has worked remotely since 2010. Assembling a strong portfolio showcases what you can do while working outside an office, Rover advised.",
      "\u201cTime management and independence, being self-motivated, are really critical,\u201d said Toni Frana, career expert at FlexJobs, a platform dedicated to helping people find remote or flexible work.",
      "If you've worked remotely before, highlight that on your resume. List communication tools you've used, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, said Dawn Fay, operational president at staffing firm Robert Half International. \u201cCall out that you have worked remotely, independently, for X amount of time successfully,\" Fay added. \"You really want to stress that.\u201d",
      "After moving on from the office job that made her miserable, Smith created a side hustle coaching other professionals who longed for a nomadic lifestyle. Her coaching eventually grew into a full-time job.",
      "When looking to transition into remote work, find a job that's similar to your current role instead of competing with better-qualified candidates for jobs that require more experience, she advised. \u201cGet your foot in the door ... and then from there work your way to the long-term goal,\u201d Smith said.",
      "You can also try to convert your current job into a remote role. That's what Courtney Sandifer attempted after her husband, 60, had a heart attack and underwent cancer treatment within the same year. He retired early and they bought a small property in Mexico near the beach, hoping to reduce stress. \u201cWe just got tired of the rat race,\u201d Sandifer said.",

      "RIO FRIO, Portugal -- U.S. winemakers have something to celebrate: the corks they\u2019re popping aren\u2019t subject to tariffs.",
      "Cork comes from the spongy bark of the cork oak tree, which is primarily grown and harvested in the Mediterranean basin. The framework trade agreement between the United States and the European Union singled out the material as an \u201cunavailable natural product.\u201d So as of Sept. 1, cork joined a handful of other items, including airplanes and generic pharmaceuticals, that are exempt from a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU products.",
      "The cork carve-out was vital for Portugal. The European country is the world\u2019s largest cork producer, accounting for about half of global production.",
      "Portuguese diplomats lobbied for the exemption on both sides of the Atlantic. Patrick Spencer, the executive director of the U.S.-based Natural Cork Council, raced from Salem, Oregon, to Washington in June to explain cork\u2019s origins to U.S. trade officials and to seek a tariff reprieve. The Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, said it also pushed for the special dispensation.",
      "Spencer said he was thrilled when a summary of the U.S.-EU agreement released in August mentioned cork.",
      "\u201cIt was a great day in our neighborhood,\u201d said Spencer, a self-described \u201ccork dork.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if cork is unique or if other natural products will be exempt from U.S. tariffs in future trade agreements. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond when The Associated Press asked about tariff exemptions.",
      "It\u2019s not even clear if the tariffs President Donald Trump put on imports from the EU's 27 member nations and almost every country will remain. Late last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump had no right to impose his sweeping tariffs, although it left them in place while his administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But if the tariffs stay in place, cork may signal other exemptions to come. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated during a July interview with CNBC that natural products like mangoes or cocoa may be free from tariffs",
      "The U.S. is the second-largest market for Portuguese cork after France. In 2023, the U.S. imported $241 million worth of cork from Portugal; just over 70% of it came in the form of stoppers for wine, spirits, olive oil, honey and other liquids, according to the Natural Cork Council, a trade group.",
      "Cork has other applications, too. NASA and SpaceX have used it for thermal protection on rockets. Cork crumbles are also used as infill for sports fields and inserted into concrete on airport runways to help absorb the shock of plane landings.",
      "Even though California has a similar climate to the Mediterranean, the U.S. has never developed a cork industry. There was an attempt to start one during World War II, and around 500 cork oaks from that period remain on the campus of the University of California, Davis.",
      "But the effort evaporated when the war ended. The problem: it takes 25 years for a cork tree to produce its first bark for harvesting, and the initial yield typically isn\u2019t high quality. After that, it takes the tree about nine years to grow new bark.",
      "\u201cAmericans are not patient enough to wait for a tree that takes 25 years to give its first harvest,\u201d said Antonio Amorim, the chairman and CEO of Portugal\u2019s Corticeira Amorim, one of the world\u2019s largest cork companies.",

      "Cork harvesting is also an extremely specialized skill, since cutting into a tree the wrong way could kill it. Cork harvesters are the highest paid agricultural workers in Europe, Spencer said.",
      "Amorim, which exports cork to more than 100 countries, has more than 20 million cork trees spread over 700,000 hectares (1.7 million acres) of woodland.",
      "On a recent day at Amorim\u2019s Herdade de Rio Frio, a farm 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Lisbon, crews zig-zagged across the thin, pale grass between scattered cork trees, kicking up dust.",
      "The quiet woodland echoed with the gentle thud of the workers\u2019 axes. They gently pierced the bark, feeling for the thickness of cork that could be peeled off without harming the trunk. The Portuguese have harvested cork this way for more than 200 years.",
      "The tree bark came off in featherweight slabs that the workers, their hands black from the oaks' natural tannins, tossed onto a flatbed truck. It would go to factories to be cut into strips and fed into a machine that punches out stoppers.",
      "Once the trees were bare, a woman painted a white \u201c5\u201d on the orange-colored trunks, signaling they were stripped in 2025. Herdade de Rio Frio's cork oaks, which are native to Portugal and can resist frequent droughts and scorching summer temperatures, were planted more than 100 years ago.",
      "Cork\u2019s sustainable harvesting process and its biodegradability are two reasons many U.S. winemakers have returned to plugging bottles with it after experimenting with closures made of aluminum, plastic and glass. In 2010, 53% of premium U.S. wines used cork stoppers; by 2022, that had risen to 64.5%, according to the Natural Cork Council.",
      "Cork taint, which gives wine a funky taste and is caused by a fungus in natural corks, was a big problem in the 1990s, and it pushed many vintners into aluminum screw caps and other closures, said Andrew Waterhouse, a chemist and director of the Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis.",
      "The cork industry has largely solved that problem, Waterhouse said. In the meantime, the wine industry came up with new technology, like screw caps that can mimic cork in the amount of oxygen they let into a bottle over time.",
      "Many wineries, including Trump Winery in Virginia, now use both screw caps and natural corks. Waterhouse said screw caps generally make more sense for a wine like ros\u00e9, which isn\u2019t intended to age, while cork is the standard for aging wines.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News seemed to be dealt a crippling blow in a $787 million settlement of a libel lawsuit more than two years ago, but has instead thrived",
      "NEW YORK -- Twice recently, the people who run Fox News were reminded of their biggest nightmare.",
      "The conservative network Newsmax's $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over false claims after the 2020 election recalled Fox's own $787.5 million deal with the same company more than two years ago. New legal papers filed last month by a second company suing Fox, Smartmatic, also put an episode they would like to forget back in the news.",
      "Between the staggering payment to bypass a defamation trial and revelations about the lengths to which Fox went to avoid telling its audience what it didn't want to hear about Donald Trump's defeat, many wondered if its actions in November 2020 would damage Fox News or compel it to change directions.",
      "Not so much, it turns out.",
      "Fox News Channel has defied gravity with its ratings, and is more popular with viewers this summer than ABC, CBS or NBC. Its top personalities resolutely support Trump, who has filled his second administration with former Fox stars like Pete Hegseth and Jeanine Pirro. Time after time, the White House turns to Fox to make news; shortly after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was sitting with Sean Hannity.",
      "Reached by The Associated Press, Fox declined to make anyone available to speak for this story.",
      "An ethos many at Fox share with the president \u2014 no expressed regrets, no apologies \u2014 has also shown signs of spreading, given Newsmax's swagger following the Aug. 11 settlement announcement.",
      "Fox News averaged 2.63 million viewers in weekday prime-time for the second quarter of 2025, up 56% from the same period in 2023, the Nielsen company said. While the increase is somewhat inflated since Fox took a hit in the ratings two years ago following the firing of Tucker Carlson, the advance of cord-cutting means that any network gaining viewers now is unusual.",
      "MSNBC's prime-time audience of 1 million this spring was down 21% in two years, and CNN's viewership of 538,000 was down 6%, Nielsen said. Forty-five percent of people watching one of the top three cable news networks at any given time two years ago were tuned to Fox. This year, that audience share jumped to 62%.",
      "Clearly, Fox's audience is more interested in following a Trump administration than it was for a Joe Biden administration. Just as clearly, the Dominion case had little appreciable impact on viewership.",
      "\u201cFox's audience didn't really look at that verdict and say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t watch them anymore,'\u201d said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cI think Fox's audience looked at that and said, \u2018oh, the left is coming after them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Financially, the Dominion settlement was stiff enough that Newsmax is spreading its payments out over three years. The much larger Fox had a greater ability to absorb its hit. Fox confirmed at the time that it could deduct the settlement from its income taxes, and insurance could make the payment lower. Meanwhile, Fox News is a profit engine and becoming even more so; Axios reported earlier this year that the company expected to make half a billion dollars on non-TV products like books, podcasts and streaming.",
      "Carlson was the face of the network before he was fired shortly after the settlement was announced, but Fox has always been able to generate new stars. Carlson took over from Bill O'Reilly when he was fired in 2017. Fox started \u201cThe Five,\u201d arguably its centerpiece show, when Glenn Beck was shown the door in 2011. Jesse Watters now owns Carlson and O'Reilly's old time slot.",
      "Yet, it's hard to understate the worry many at Fox had about losing audience immediately following the 2020 election. Trump, and many of his fans, were angry that the network declared Biden the winner in Arizona before most news outlets, a pivotal moment in the vote-counting.",
      "Internal messages and deposition interviews revealed in court papers tied to Smartmatic's lawsuit reveal much of that drama. Management criticized anchor Neil Cavuto for ordering his show to cut away from Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she began talking about election fraud. News reporters were disciplined for fact-checking some of Trump's claims. Many in Fox's audience expressed anger at hearing Trump corrected and wanted to hear conspiracy theories.",

      "Fox has also maintained its dominance by playing a form of hardball that Newsmax alleged, in a lawsuit filed this week, violates antitrust laws.

Coomer, in turn, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.",
      "According to court papers in the case, Newsmax executive Gary Kanofsky wrote about conspiracy theorists to a colleague shortly after the election: \u201cSimply giving them a microphone to spew more anti-election rhetoric and advance their claims without being properly equipped to question the legitimacy or factual accuracy of their assertions may be fun, but it\u2019s terrible journalism.\u201d",

      "The network said on the air: \u201cNewsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020. We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\u201d",
      "What has changed? Newsmax has grown, and two months after Trump took office again, it went public. It invites members of its audience \u2014 dominated by Trump fans \u2014 to invest in the network.",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",

      "Oregon coach Dan Lanning suggested that comments Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy made this week about the financial disparities between the two teams contributed to the Ducks' 69-3 rout of the Cowboys on Saturday.",
      "\u201cI told our team right before the game that, it never requires extra motivation for an opportunity to go out and kick ass, but it never hurts when somebody pours gasoline on the fire,\u201d Lanning said.",
      "Earlier in the week, Gundy talked about Oregon's apparent NIL resources, saying the Cowboys spent \u201caround $7 million\u201d on their team over three years while claiming the Ducks had spent close to $40 million last year alone \u2014 while admitting that he might be off a few million.",
      "\u201cOregon is paying a lot, a lot of money for their team,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a nonconference standpoint, there\u2019s coaches saying they should play teams that are spending the same amount of money.\u201d",
      "Lanning responded in his Monday news conference.",
      "\u201cUltimately, how blessed are we to be in a place that\u2019s invested in winning? If you want to be a Top 10 team in college football, you better be invested in winning. And we spend to win. Some people save to have an excuse for why they don\u2019t, right?\u201d Lanning said.",

      "Scientists conducting a first-of-its-kind drilling operation have extracted samples of fresh water hiding in massive reservoirs deep under the ocean",
      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",
      "It found an eye-opening amount of fresh or freshened water in borehole after borehole.",

      "Soon after Robert arrived at the first of three drilling sites May 19, samples drawn from below the seabed registered salinity of just 4 parts per thousand. That's far below the oceans' average salt content of 35 parts per thousand but still too briny to meet the U.S. freshwater standard of under 1 part per thousand.",
      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",
      "In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.",
      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",
      "In a prelude to the poem, in some editions, Coleridge wrote: \"I readily believe that there are more invisible than visible Natures in the universe.\u201d",

      "A congressional investigation finds the Pentagon has funded research involving collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense sector",
      "WASHINGTON -- Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.",
      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "The scientist, who has done research on high-energy materials, nitrogen and high-pressure physics \u2014 all of which are relevant to nuclear weapons development \u2014 has been honored in China for his work to advance the country's national development goals, the report said. It called the case \u201ca deeply troubling example\u201d of how Beijing can leverage U.S. taxpayer-funded research to further its weapons development.",
      "In another Pentagon-backed project, Arizona State University and the University of Texas partnered with researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Beihang University to study high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments, which has direct applications for electronic warfare and cyber defense, the report said. The money came from the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Office and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",
      "The Shanghai university is under the supervision of a central Chinese agency tasked with developing defense technology, and Beihang University, in the capital city of Beijing, is linked to the People's Liberation Army and known for its aerospace programs.",
      "The report takes issue with Defense Department policies that do not explicitly forbid research partnerships with foreign institutions that appear on U.S. government blacklists.",
      "It makes more than a dozen recommendations, including a prohibition on any Pentagon research collaboration with entities that are on U.S. blacklists or \u201cknown to be part of China\u2019s defense research and industrial base.\u201d",
      "Moolenaar's legislation includes a similar provision and proposes a ban on Defense Department funding for U.S. universities that operate joint institutes with Chinese universities.",
      "A senior Education Department official said the report \u201chighlights the vulnerability of federally funded research to foreign infiltration on America\u2019s campuses.\u201d Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said the findings reinforce the need for more transparency around U.S. universities' international ties, along with a \"whole-of-government approach to safeguard against the malign influence of hostile foreign actors.\u201d",
      "House investigators said they are not seeking to end all academic and research collaborations with China but those with connections to the Chinese military and its research and industrial base.",

      "If you have trouble finding dates, spare a thought for Ned, a perfectly nice snail with dire romantic prospects",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",
      "Ned\u2019s shell coils to the left, not the right, making him the 1 in 40,000 snails whose sex organs don\u2019t line up with those of the rest of their species. Unless another lefty snail is found, the young gastropod faces a lifetime of unintentional celibacy.",
      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",
      "Back in Wairarapa, Ned\u2019s constant presence in a tank in Clarkson\u2019s living room has kindled a life of quiet companionship and existential questions.",
      "\u201cMaybe snails don\u2019t have a concept of loneliness,\u201d Clarkson found herself thinking. What if Ned didn\u2019t mind being single?",
      "However the young snail feels about his prospects, Ned probably has time. Garden snails live for two to five years and his shell suggests he\u2019s about 6 months old, Clarkson said.",

      "IRVING, Texas -- Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.",
      "The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.",
      "\u201cOh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,\u201d said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.",
      "In de Zavala\u2019s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that\u2019s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala\u2019s higher grades \u2014 whose students joined before it was a STEM school \u2014 some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.",
      "Efforts to close the gap between boys and girls in STEM classes are picking up after losing steam nationwide during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have extensive work ahead to make up for the ground girls lost, in both interest and performance.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys' scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.",
      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",
      "Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just call it what it is,\u201d Stie said. \u201cWhen society is disrupted, you fall back into bad patterns.\u201d",
      "In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP's analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",
      "A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.",
      "Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,\u201d said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, teaching practices shifted to deemphasize speed, competition and rote memorization. Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.",
      "Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls\u2019 confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.",
      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City. Girls were significantly more engaged after the district moved some of its introductory hands-on STEM curriculum to the lower grade levels and balanced classes by gender, he said.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",

The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists revealed Wednesday that Mars\u2019 innermost core appears to be a solid hunk of metal just like Earth\u2019s.",
      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",
      "Previous studies pointed to liquid at the heart of the red planet. The latest findings indicate the inner core, while small, is indeed solid and surrounded by molten metal \u2014 a liquid outer core.",
      "The Martian inner core extends from the planet\u2019s center out to a radius of approximately 380 miles (613 kilometers), according to the scientists whose findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "It\u2019s likely composed of iron and nickel, the same ingredients as Earth\u2019s core, but quite possibly also enriched with lighter elements like oxygen.",
      "Mars\u2019 liquid outer core is bigger, stretching from 380 miles (613 kilometers) to as much as 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the planet\u2019s center.",
      "Crystallization of Mars\u2019 inner core may have occurred in the past and still be occurring today, one of the lead investigators, Daoyuan Sun of the University of Science and Technology of China, said in an email.",
      "Mars\u2019 core initially would have been entirely liquid. It\u2019s unclear whether the liquid outer core contains any solid material like droplets or whether there might be \u201ca mushy zone\u201d near the boundary between the inner and outer cores, he added.",
      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "The 6.0 magnitude quake late Sunday hit towns in the province of Kunar, near the city of Jalalabad in neighboring Nangarhar province, causing extensive damage.",
      "The quake at 11:47 p.m. was centered 27 kilometers (17 miles) east-northeast of Jalalabad, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was just 8 kilometers (5 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more damage. Several aftershocks followed.",

      "Eastern Afghanistan is mountainous, with remote areas.",
      "The quake has worsened communications. Blocked roads are forcing aid workers to walk four or five hours to reach survivors. Dozens of flights have operated in and out of Nangarhar Airport, transporting the injured to hospitals.",
      "One survivor described seeing homes collapse before his eyes and people screaming for help.",
      "Sadiqullah, who lives in the Maza Dara area of Nurgal, said he was woken by a deep boom that sounded like a storm approaching. Like many Afghans, he uses only one name.",
      "He ran to where his children were sleeping and rescued three of them. He was about to return to grab the rest of his family when the room fell on top of him.",
      "\u201cI was half-buried and unable to get out,\u201d he told The Associated Press by phone from Nangarhar Hospital. \u201cMy wife and two sons are dead, and my father is injured and in hospital with me. We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.\"",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA\u2019s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",

But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ranchers are compensated if they can prove that a wolf killed their livestock. But there are uncompensated costs of having stressed-out cows, such as lower birth rates and tougher meat.",
      "Rickert said if the drones don't work over the long term, she might have to close the business, which she's been involved in since at least the 1980s. She wants permission to shoot wolves if they're attacking her animals or if they come onto her property after a certain number of attacks.",
      "If the technology proves effective and costs come down, someday ranchers might merely have to ask the wolves to go away.",
      "Oregon-based Paul Wolf \u2014 yes, Wolf \u2014 is the USDA's southwest district supervisor and the main Five Finger Death Punch fan among the drone pilots. He recalled an early encounter during which a wolf at first merely seemed curious at the sight of a drone, until the pilot talked to it through the speaker.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Hey wolf \u2014 get out of here,\u2019\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThe wolf immediately lets go of the cattle and runs away.\u201d",

      "Ishiba, who took office in October, had resisted demands from mostly right-wing opponents within his own party for more than a month, saying such a step would cause a political vacuum when Japan faces key challenges in and outside the country.",
      "The resignation came one day before his Liberal Democratic Party was to decide whether to hold an early leadership election, a virtual no-confidence motion against him if approved.",
      "Ishiba said during a televised press conference he would start a process to hold a party leadership vote to choose his replacement and that there was no need for Monday\u2019s decision.",
      "If the prime minister had stayed on, he would have inevitably struggled to manage his divided party and minority government.",
      "In July, Ishiba \u2019s ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government. The loss added to an earlier election defeat in the lower house, where the party-led coalition also had lost a majority.",
      "His decision came after his meeting Saturday with Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and his perceived mentor, former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who apparently suggested Ishiba\u2019s resignation ahead of Monday\u2019s vote.",
      "He had previously insisted on staying, stressing the need to avoid a political vacuum at a time Japan faces big challenges, including U.S. tariffs and their impact on the economy, rising prices, rice policy reforms and growing tension in the region.",
      "Since the LDP\u2019s last week adoption of its review of the election loss, which called for \u201da complete overhaul\u201d of the party, requests for an early leadership vote or for Ishiba\u2019s resignation before Monday\u2019s results have gained traction.",
      "A conservative heavyweight Taro Aso, known for his anti-Ishiba stance, and a minister and several deputy ministers in the Ishiba Cabinet have requested an early vote, prompting others to follow suit.",
      "Former Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told an NHK talk show earlier Sunday that the best way to stop the party divide and move forward is for Ishiba \u201cto settle\u201d the dispute before Monday\u2019s vote, urging his resignation. The party has already been distracted from necessary work on economic measures and on figuring out ways to gain opposition support in the next parliamentary session, Tamura said.",

      "Lacking a majority in both houses, the next LDP leader will have to work with the main opposition parties to get bills passed, experts say, or else face constant risks of no-confidence motions.",
      "The opposition parties, however, are too splintered to form a big coalition to topple the government.",
      "In recent weeks, Ishiba successfully got U.S. President Donald Trump to lower the tariff rates the US administration imposed on Japan from 25% to 15%. Ishiba also said he has had his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, deliver his letter to Trump, stating his wish to work with him to create \u201cthe golden era\u201d of the Japan-U.S. alliance, inviting the American leader to visit Japan.",
      "Ishiba's top aide, LDP Secretary General Hiroshi Moriyama, a key figure who negotiated with main opposition leaders to help achieve legislation since the prime minister took office, has also expressed his intention to step down on Sept. 2 over the election loss, though Ishiba hasn\u2019t granted him resignation. Moriyama's departure would have dealt a blow to the prime minister.",

      "Thousands have taken to the streets of Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of protesters marched across Washington, D.C., on Saturday in one of the largest demonstrations against President Donald Trump's federal takeover of policing in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Behind a bright red banner reading \u201cEND THE D.C. OCCUPATION\u201d in English and Spanish, protesters marched over two miles from Meridian Hill Park to Freedom Plaza near the White House to rail against the fourth week of National Guard troops and federal agents patrolling D.C.\u2019s streets.",
      "The \u201cWe Are All D.C.\u201d protest \u2014 put together by local advocates of Home Rule and the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 was perhaps the most organized demonstration yet against Trump's federal intervention in Washington. The president justified the action last month as a way to address crime and homelessness in the city, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "Trump targeted D.C. after deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier this summer as the administration ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts and attempted to quell protests. The White House then turned to Washington, which presented a unique opportunity for Trump to push his tough-on-crime agenda because of its subservient status to the federal government.",
      "The presence of armed military officers in the streets has put Washington on edge and spurred weeks of demonstrations, particularly in D.C. neighborhoods. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration taking charge of D.C. police is set to expire on Wednesday.",
      "Mark Fitzpatrick, a former U.S. diplomat who has been a D.C. resident for around a decade, told The Associated Press on Saturday that he's worried about the \u201cauthoritarian nature\u201d in which the administration is treating D.C.",
      "\u201cFederal agents, national guards patrolling our streets, that\u2019s really an affront to the democracy of our city,\" he said, adding that it\u2019s worse for D.C. residents due to their lack of federal representation. \"We don\u2019t have our own senators or members of the House of Representatives, so we\u2019re at the mercy of a dictator like this, a wanna-be dictator.\u201d",
      "Among the protesters Saturday were also former D.C. residents like Tammy Price, who called the Trump administration's takeover \u201cevil\" and \u201cnot for the people.\u201d",
      "Jun Lee, a printmaker artist living in Washington, showed up with a \u201cFree DC\u201d sign that she made on a woodcut block. She said she came to the protest because she was \u201csaddened and heartbroken\u201d about the impact of the federal intervention on her city.",

      "Also on Saturday, Trump repeated threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he wants to target for expanded federal enforcement. His administration is set to step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, similar to what took place in Los Angeles, and deploy National Guard troops. Like the District of Columbia, Chicago's recent crime data does not reflect the war zones Trump has repeatedly compared it to.",
      "Violent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. Shootings are down 37%, and homicides have dropped by 32%, while total violent crime dropped by over 22%.",

      "Dr_ Joseph Ladapo, a Nigerian-born physician with impeccable U_S_ medical credentials, says that requiring vaccinations for diseases like measles, polio and chickenpox amounts to government-imposed \u201cslavery.\u201d",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Dr. Joseph Ladapo, whose credentials include two Harvard University degrees, says that requiring vaccinations for diseases like measles, polio and chickenpox amounts to government-imposed \u201cslavery.\u201d It\u2019s far from the first time Florida\u2019s surgeon general has cut against the medical establishment grain.",
      "Ladapo, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, made worldwide headlines this week by announcing Florida would seek to eliminate all mandated vaccinations for schoolchildren and others. He cast the immunization requirements, which date back decades and are considered a major global medical achievement that has saved millions of lives, as improper government intrusion in personal health decisions.",
      "\u201cEvery last one is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,\" Ladapo said at a news conference with DeSantis this week. \u201cWho am I, or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body? Who am I to tell you what your child should put in their body? I don\u2019t have that right.\u201d",
      "So far, a concrete action plan for eliminating immunization mandates in Florida has not emerged, despite multiple requests by The Associated Press. Ladapo acknowledged some proposed changes would require the state Legislature to act. Educators and many health professionals are aghast.",
      "\u201cRemoving policies that keep our children healthy creates unnecessary confusion and fear,\u201d said Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cSchools are tight-knit networks of children, educators, and families, making it easy for contagious diseases to spread.\"",
      "Ladapo, 46, emigrated from Nigeria to the U.S. at age five with his parents. He earned a degree in chemistry from Wake Forest University and then attended Harvard, where he got his medical degree and also a doctorate in health policy.",
      "This is a well-trodden path for medical expertise. Ladapo was affiliated after Harvard with New York University and later UCLA, where his op-eds against the pandemic response were noticed by DeSantis, who tapped him as Florida surgeon general in 2021. Ladapo also got a professor position at the University of Florida medical school in the deal.",
      "Like the governor, Ladapo raised questions about COVID-19 policies that forced people to wear masks and move education online, keep their distance from others and show proof of COVID vaccinations to attend public events, go to a restaurant or take a cruise. Ladapo also misrepresented studies to raise doubts about the mRNA vaccine, the studies' authors said.",
      "In a 2024 guidance statement, Ladapo's Department of Health warned against using the COVID vaccine at all, contending that \u201cthe federal government has failed to provide sufficient data to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 boosters, or acknowledge previously demonstrated safety concerns associated with COVID-19 vaccines and boosters.\u201d Those purported risks include respiratory tract infections, greater chance of autoimmune disease and cardiovascular problems.",
      "Almost every major medical or public health organization disputed those assertions, including the Food and Drug Administration: \u201cThe challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake,\u201d said the FDA statement, adding that the agency \u201crespectfully disagrees with the Florida Surgeon General\u2019s opinion.\u201d",
      "In his public comments, Ladapo makes clear he does not follow the guidance of government health experts who, in his view, don't look at the full picture of how to tackle disease and improve public health. His agency did not respond to an Associated Press request for an interview.",

      "\u201cAt what point are you free to make your own decisions?\" DeSantis said this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot over the years to really be on the right side of fighting against the hysteria.\u201d",
      "Ladapo has many critics in the public health realm and, increasingly, among politicians seeking to tie his unorthodox policies to DeSantis and other Republicans. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat from South Florida, wants Ladapo ousted.",
      "\u201cAre we losing our minds? This is getting ridiculous and pathetic. Are we trying to kill millions of innocent children? Childhood vaccines save lives,\u201d Wilson posted on social media this week. \u201cGovernor DeSantis must either remove Joseph Ladapo as Surgeon General or have him resign.\u201d",
      "There's no indication that will happen. Ladapo appears to have full support from DeSantis and many conservatives cheer his willingness to buck the medical establishment, including what some see as the untoward influence of pharmaceutical companies.",
      "\u201cThere are many brave people out there \u2014 moms & dads, doctors, scientists, and others \u2014 who have shown admirable courage in the fight for medical freedom,\u201d Ladapo posted recently on the X social media platform. \u201cLet's continue. Much more work to be done.\u201d",

      "South Korea says it has reached a deal with the U.S. for the release of South Korean workers detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- More than 300 South Korean workers detained following a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home, the South Korean government announced Sunday.",
      "Presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said that South Korea and the U.S. had finalized negotiations on the workers\u2019 release. He said South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home as soon as remaining administrative steps are completed.",
      "U.S. immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, when hundreds of federal agents raided Hyundai's sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where the Korean automaker Hyundai makes electric vehicles. South Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun later said that more than 300 South Koreans were among the detained.",
      "The operation was the latest a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site state officials have long called Georgia\u2019s largest economic development project.",
      "Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist.",

      "The U.S. Capitol Police have led a massive training exercise in Maryland to improve coordination among law enforcement agencies",
      "LAUREL, Md. -- The car jolted as protesters pounded on its windows, boxing in the lawmaker trapped inside. Within seconds, officers in full riot gear surged forward in formation, yanking open the doors and pulling the passenger to safety. A few hundred yards away, another team of police moved just as quickly, surrounding, isolating and arresting a man spotted in the crowd with a gun.",
      "The clashes were staged, unfolding Friday at a Secret Service training complex in Maryland. The U.S. Capitol Police led the operation, joined by 600 officers representing nearly 20 agencies \u2014 including the Secret Service and local police and sheriff\u2019s departments \u2014 in one of the largest law enforcement training drills in the country. The goal was to sharpen coordination among the many agencies that must work side by side in Washington, a push shaped by the glaring security breakdowns of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "With 2025 on track to bring more threats against members of Congress than any year in history, law enforcement agencies are bracing for a volatile era defined by surging political violence, swelling protest movements and a more muscular federal role in local communities. The training highlighted how quickly multiple dangers can erupt at once, and how determined authorities are to prepare for the next flashpoint.",
      "The exercise comes at a moment when threats and attacks against public officials are mounting, and federal authorities have stepped more aggressively into cities to confront unrest. From the storming of the Capitol to more recent attacks targeting lawmakers and judges, the scenarios practiced in Friday\u2019s drill carried an unmistakable resonance: In today\u2019s America, the line between routine dissent and potential disaster feels increasingly thin.",
      "Commanders emphasized that the drills are not just about riot shields and tactical maneuvers. They also showcased new tools meant to prevent the kinds of communication breakdowns that hobbled the Jan. 6 response. Drones provided real-time aerial views of the mock protests, while mobile command posts allowed leaders from different agencies to track the action simultaneously and direct units on the ground.",
      "Officials said the biggest shift since Jan. 6 has been the rhythm of coordination itself. Agencies that once trained largely in isolation now drill together, building muscle memory for rapid deployments and cross-agency communication that can determine whether a protest remains peaceful or spirals into violence.",
      "\u201cTraining like this is incredibly important,\u201d said Michael Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. \u201cMaking sure that we understand how the different teams work is critically important if we ever have to make that call for them to come in and help.\u201d",
      "The push reflects how deeply Jan. 6 still looms over the force. Sean Gallagher, an assistant chief who has overseen the department\u2019s response to scathing inspector general and congressional reports, said the agency is not ignoring those failures. Instead, he cast the drill as a deliberate attempt to turn lessons into action.",

It\u2019s a heightened political environment that we continuously operate in on Capitol Hill. We\u2019ve taken the lessons of the past, we\u2019ve incorporated them into these scenarios and the goal with this is to be proactive and not reactive.\u201d",
      "That urgency is felt not just in the command ranks but also on the front lines. Aaron Davis, a Capitol Police officer who has worked on the civil disturbance unit for nearly eight years and responded to the Jan. 6 attack, said the drills are essential because no scenario feels implausible anymore.",
      "\u201cWe use our imagination like crazy in training, just because you don\u2019t want that to be the first time you encounter something of that nature,\u201d he said, recalling the storming of the Capitol that left hundreds of his fellow officers injured.",
      "In other scenarios, demonstrators shouted \u201cFree D.C.\u201d as they hurled wooden blocks meant to simulate bricks \u2014 a nod to the rising anger over the surge of federal agents and National Guard troops into the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cKeep moving, back up!\u201d officers yelled as they marched the crowd down the street behind riot shields, while an unmarked police van pulled in to carry away those taken off in handcuffs. The realism of the drills, officials said, was intentional: Each scenario was designed to mirror the volatile mix of protest and confrontation that has become increasingly common in American cities.",
      "For the Secret Service, the lessons stretch back to the mass demonstrations that filled Washington in 2020 during the first Trump administration. Andrew Ackley, assistant chief of the agency\u2019s Uniform Division, said those experiences underscored how much tactics must change as threats evolve.",
      "\u201cThe training has evolved significantly because we\u2019re constantly learning. None of these situations are identical, right? None of these situations can be copycat from another one. So we\u2019re constantly evolving. We\u2019re constantly training,\u201d Ackley said.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A scramble is underway for some Ohio families over a staple of the back-to-school season: rides on the big, yellow school bus.",
      "Public school districts canceled bus transportation for thousands of high schoolers again this year while in some cases still busing students to private and charter schools to avoid steep fines under state requirements. In Dayton, a stopgap effort that gives students public transit passes in lieu of school bus rides was temporarily restored by a judge last week. This came after the district sued, alleging the state illegally restricted the program.",
      "The crunch for rides emerged as a bus driver shortage was compounded by Ohio's school transportation regulations and its expansion to a universal voucher program to help pay for students to attend private schools. Districts have been required for years to transport students with EdChoice vouchers, but disputes over how to do that intensified as the program added nearly 90,000 students over the past four years.",
      "Advocates for public education argue Ohio's transportation mandates are inflexible, vague and expensive.",
      "It makes public school districts responsible for transporting K-8 students to their private or charter schools, even on district holidays or when buses break down. It also requires districts to extend whatever transportation service they offer to their own high schoolers to every high schooler at a private or charter school in the same area.",
      "Some large districts responded by canceling bus service to high schools altogether, providing city transit passes where available or leaving public school students to find their own rides. And those districts still might have to bus private students if those students weren\u2019t notified within a certain timeframe.",
      "\u201cTo know that they are having to take those public dollars to funnel into other entities is not a fair situation, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right,\" said Ronnee Tingle, a Dayton mom whose 7th-grader rides the school bus and whose teens in public school have to take a city bus.",
      "Her daughter Suelonnee Tingle, a senior, begins her mornings checking an app for when a public bus will arrive at her stop. Riding it is \u201cnot bad,\u201d but learning routes, catching connections and getting to school on time can be challenging as arrival times fluctuate, she said.",
      "Dayton Superintendent David Lawrence calls it \u201cmadness\u201d that the Republican-led Legislature diverted roughly $2.5 billion in state education funding to the voucher program over the next two years \u2014 and still is still is requiring public districts to foot transportation costs for those students. His district runs 54 bus routes for its students and 74 for non-public students, according to data compiled by the Ohio 8 Coalition, representing the eight largest districts.",
      "The Dayton district could easily provide bus rides for all of its public school students if the state ended some of the requirements about transporting voucher students, Lawrence said.",
      "\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have to transport charter school and parochial students, we could transfer all of our students almost door to door from K through 12,\u201d he said. That would also help eliminate ancillary issues that arose with public high schoolers making their own ways to school, including disruptions on city buses and threats to their physical safety, he said.",
      "Republican state Sen. Andrew Brenner, a school choice advocate who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said he doesn't believe that financial hardship, logistical nightmares and driver recruitment challenges are creating a school transportation crisis in Ohio, as public education advocates contend.",
      "\u201cThat's a completely inaccurate description,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they have done is they're excluding all the kids with school choice in many districts and they're doing everything they can to avoid transporting them.\u201d",

Spokesperson Mike Brown said the district has $75 million budgeted this school year for transportation, and another $15 million budgeted for transportation-related fines.",
      "Lawrence said Ohio's setup requires public districts to cover overhead for transportation systems. In Dayton, that includes buses that can cost more than $150,000 each, a stable of $66,000-a-year mechanics, a $1.1 million maintenance division, and drivers who make about $22 an hour with benefits on average.

      "\u201cThe threat for any wind is diminishing,\u201d Joseph Clark, a meteorologist with the weather service in Honolulu, said Saturday. \u201cWith the storm going north, it tends to actually make the winds lighter than normal over the islands. So if the current track holds up, the winds will be pretty light, and it might end up being hot and muggy without much wind.\u201d",

      "A Black man in South Carolina is pushing for the state to pass its own hate crime law after police say he was shot at by a white man in a racist attack",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- When Jarvis McKenzie locked eyes with the man in the car, he couldn't understand the hate he saw. When the man picked up a rifle, fired over his head and yelled \u201cyou better get running, boy!\u201d as he scrambled behind a brick wall, McKenzie knew it was because he is Black.",
      "McKenzie told his story a month after the shooting because South Carolina is one of two states along with Wyoming that don't have their own hate crime laws.",
      "About two dozen local governments in South Carolina have passed their own hate crime ordinances as the latest attempt to put pressure on the South Carolina Senate to take a vote on a bill proposing stiffer penalties for crimes driven by hatred of the victims because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender or ethnicity.",
      "A decade of pressure from businesses, the survivors of a racist Charleston church massacre that left nine dead, and a few of their own Republicans hasn't been enough to sway senators.",
      "Richland County, where McKenzie lives, has a hate crime ordinance and the white man seen on security camera footage grabbing the rifle and firing through his open car window before driving into his neighborhood on July 24 is the first to face the charge.",
      "But local laws are restricted to misdemeanors with sentences capped at a month in jail. The state hate crimes proposal backed by business leaders could add years on to convictions for assault and other violent crimes.",
      "McKenzie sat in the same spot at the edge of his neighborhood for a year at 5:30 a.m. waiting for his supervisor to pick him up for work. For him and his family, every trip outside now is met with uneasiness if not fear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to know that I get up every morning. I stand there not knowing if he had seen me before,\u201d McKenzie said.",
      "The lack of a statewide hate crime law rapidly became a sore spot in South Carolina after the 2015 shooting deaths of nine Black worshippers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. After a summer of racial strife in 2020, business leaders made it a priority and the South Carolina House passed its version in 2021.",
      "But in 2021 and again in the next session in 2023, the proposal stalled in the South Carolina Senate without a vote. Supporters say Republican Senate leadership knows it will pass as more moderate members of their own party support it but they keep it buried on the calendar with procedural moves.",
      "The opposition is done mostly in silence and the bill gets only mentioned in passing as the Senate takes up other items, like in May 2023 when a debate on guidelines for history curriculum on subjects like slavery and segregation briefly had a longtime Democratic lawmaker ask Republican Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey why hate crimes couldn't get a vote.",
      "\u201cThe problem right now is there is a number of people who think that not only is it feel good legislation, but it is bad legislation. It is bad policy not because people support hate but because it furthers division,\u201d Massey responded on the Senate floor.",

      "Democrats in the Senate were especially frustrated in this year's session because while senators debated harsher sentences for attacking health care workers or police dogs, hate crimes again got nowhere.",

      "\"The subliminal message that says if you\u2019re racist and you want to commit a crime and target somebody for their race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or whatever it is you can do it here,\u201d said McKenzie's attorney, Tyler Bailey.",
      "Republican Gov. Henry McMaster understands why local governments are passing their own hate crime laws, but he said South Carolina's laws against assaults and other violent crimes have harsh enough sentences that judges can give maximum punishments if they think the main motivation of a crime is hate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a love crime. There is always an element of hatred or disrespect or something like that,\u201d said the former prosecutor who added he fears the danger that happens when investigators try to enter someone's mind or police their speech.",

      "And while the man charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature for shooting at McKenzie faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, the man who was just waiting to go to work feels like the state where he lives doesn't care about the terror he felt just because of his race.",
      "\u201cI feel like somebody is watching me. I feel like I'm being followed,\u201d McKenzie said. \"It spooked me.\u201d",

      "This is the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda.

      "Attorney Charles Kuck said one of his clients has been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks, while the other has been in the country for about 45 days, adding that they had been planning to return home soon.",
      "Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday that none of its employees had been detained as far as it knew and that it is reviewing its practices to make sure suppliers and subcontractors follow U.S. employment laws.

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to dispatch National Guard troops and immigration agents into Chicago has put many Latino residents on edge",
      "CHICAGO -- President Donald Trump's plan to dispatch National Guard troops and immigration agents into Chicago has put many Latino residents on edge, prompting some to carry their U.S. passports while giving others pause about openly celebrating the upcoming Mexican Independence Day.",
      "Though the holiday falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants. Festivities will kick off with a Saturday parade through the heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood and continue with car caravans and lively street parties.",
      "But this year the typically joyful period coincides with Trump's threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democrat-led cities he has targeted for expanded federal enforcement. His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, as it did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops to help fight crime. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Although details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, local opposition is already widespread and includes suburban communities with their own bases of immigrant communities. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.",
      "The extended Mexican Independence Day celebrations reflect the size and vitality of Chicago\u2019s Mexican American community. Mexicans make up more than one-fifth of the city\u2019s total population and about 74% of its Latino residents, according to 2022 U.S. Census estimates.",
      "Organizers of the regular community parades and festivals have been divided over whether to move forward with precautions or postpone, in hopes that it will feel safer for many participants to have a true celebration in several months' time. In Pilsen, organizers said this week that community safety should be prioritized. A downtown Mexican Independence Day festival set for next weekend, though, was postponed this week by organizers, who said the decision was made to protect people.",
      "\u201cBut also we just refuse to let our festival be a pawn in this political game,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, an organizer of El Grito Chicago.",
      "In Pilsen and Little Village, two of the city's best-known neighborhoods with restaurants, businesses and cultural ties to Mexican culture, residents expressed disappointment at the fear and anxiety the potential federal intervention was instilling within the community during a time of year usually characterized by joy, togetherness and celebration of Mexican American culture and heritage.",
      "For Galiela Mendez, the decision to postpone El Grito Chicago was both heartbreaking and understandable.",
      "And while the nation's third-largest city has its problems, including persistent gun violence in some areas, Mendez said Trump and his supporters are maligning Chicago for political gain while disrupting festivities for a large cross-section of the population.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a slap in the face,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cI think we are all on edge because it\u2019s the same people that describes our home this way, but they never come here and see it for themselves.\u201d",
      "Vianney Alarcon, 42, said she expects people to be targeted by immigration officials regardless of their legal status.",
      "\u201cThey're just going to catch and ask questions later,\u201d she said.",
      "But in an act of defiance, she'll be taking part in the festivities, while bringing along her passport.",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.",
      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",

Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.",

      "Armani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s.

But a small gymnasium in Nashville \u2013 the home of the Donelson Christian Academy Wildcats \u2013 is where he's recently made his mark. He's donated more than a million dollars to his alma matter, which now features the Nate Bargatze Gymnasium.",

His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own. Golf is, uh, you're so much like thinking about what you're doing out there. I realized, like, I can't turn my brain off, so I just need to direct it to something else.\"",
      "Bargatze has a lot to focus on. The day before he hosts the Emmys in Los Angeles, he's performing two back-to-back arena shows in Denver. But he wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "He said, \"I know how to kind of operate in this chaos. And if you pulled me out and gave me a month off, I think I would be like lost right now. Let's keep going. We're in a good groove. You don't want to kind of stop the groove. Yeah, it'll be a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff!\"",

    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

    "summary": "The NFL season opened with the defending champ Philadelphia Eagles edging the Dallas Cowboys, 24-20 in a game with a rare, hour-long lightning-related delay.",
    "story": [
      "Philadelphia \u2014 Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns for the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, who lost their hot-tempered star defender for spitting on Dak Prescott, then withstood a rare weather delay and needed a late stop to beat the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 early Friday in a wild start to the NFL season.",
      "With one last chance at a comeback, Prescott threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-3 with 1:54 left to send what was left of a thinned out Eagles crowd into a frenzy.",
      "The game ended at 12:18 a.m.",
      "It was delayed 65 minutes because of lightning in the area. The Eagles led 24-20 with 4:44 left in the third quarter when the gamn was stopped - and that's the way it ended.",
      "Hurts wore out a defense without Micah Parsons on TD runs of 4 and 8 yards - no legal tush push needed. Saquon Barkley also ran for a 10-yard score, even if his final rushing total of 60 yards was minuscule compared to the last season, when he topped 2,000 yards.",
      "Hurts punctuated one score by chucking the ball into the stands and shrugging his shoulders much like his friend and mentor, Michael Jordan, who received a nice ovation when he was shown on the big screen.",
      "\"I think our discipline wasn't in it early in the game,\" Hurts said. \"Great job by our defense being able to battle and respond. Guys stepped in and filled those roles. We came into this game talking about discipline and focus, and we'll leave it saying the same things.\"",
      "Hurts, Barkley and the rest of the Eagles spent a pregame ceremony where the team raised their 2024 championship banner inside the locker room, per the wishes of coach Nick Sirianni.",
      "\"It's a new team. It's a new journey. We got tested tonight,\" Hurts said. \"We know how they are when Dak is back and they've got their crew all together. We've played better football, but it's always good to say that and find a way to win.\"",
      "Jalen Carter headed right back inside only moments after the banner was raised.",
      "Prescott and Carter exchanged words after the opening kickoff, and Carter spit on Prescott's jersey before backing away. Prescott quickly motioned to a nearby official who threw the flag and sent Carter packing. Fans booed as Carter walked off slowly, the standout defensive tackle holding his helmet in his hands behind his back.",
      "Carter could be headed toward a hefty financial penalty, if not worse, in the first major test of the NFL's increased emphasis this season on sportsmanship.",
      "The ejection was the quickest in a game since 2005, when former Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Sr. was ejected from the game for a pregame altercation prior to Philadelphia's season opener, notes CBSSports.com's Garrett Podell and Jeff Kerr.",
      "Still one of the NFL's nastiest division rivalries, the game was full of skirmishes and a near-costly unnecessary roughness penalty late in the third against the Eagles that put the Cowboys in position to take the lead.",
      "Dallas running back Miles Sanders, though, fumbled the ball at the 10 and the Super Bowl champions recovered. Prescott made a touchdown-saving diving tackle on cornerback Quinyon Mitchell on the play.",
      "It would be a while until the Eagles got the ball back, thanks to the delay.",
      "The scores by Hurts and Barkley made the Eagles the first defending Super Bowl champions to score touchdown on the first three drives of the season since Green Bay in 2011. Jake Elliott put the finishing touches on the scoring with a 58-yard field goal.",
      "Javonte Williams had a pair of 1-yard touchdown runs - the first on the opening driving after Carter was ejected - and Brandon Aubrey kicked field goals of 41 and 53 yards.",
      "Eagles offensive lineman Landon Dickerson left with a back injury.",
      "Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer lost his head coaching debut. He was promoted him from offensive coordinator to be the 10th coach in the storied franchise's history.",
      "Dallas plays its home opener against the Giants.",

      "The couple announced their engagement on Aug. 26, 13 days after Swift's \"New Heights\" episode dropped. Fans were quick to speculate about when Kelce popped the question \u2014 and they didn't have to wait long before getting a timeline from Kelce's dad Ed, who told News 5 Cleveland that the couple got engaged roughly two weeks earlier.",
      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",

      "As Swifties and Chief fans alike already know, their relationship began after Kelce's failed attempt to meet Swift at Arrowhead Stadium. He talked about the show in a July 2023 episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast, telling his brother Jason Kelce that he was disappointed that he wasn't able to give her a friendship bracelet he had made with his number on it.",
      "After the episode aired, Swift heard from people close to Kelce, including Chiefs coach Andy Reid, encouraging her to reach out to him. And the rest is history.",

    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On August 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",

      "Over 1,000 HHS staffers call on Trump to fire RFK Jr. for \"endangering the nation's health\"",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2013 not skeptics \u2013 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2013 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2013 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2013 now featuring Kennedy appointees \u2013 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy denied pressuring the ousted CDC director to preapprove vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday denied that he pressured the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to preapprove vaccination recommendations from a panel he overhauled before her firing.",
      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",
      "\"One of the troubling directives from that meeting more than a week ago: I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,\" she wrote.",
      "The piece was published shortly before Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where he faced tough questioning about his vaccine policies.",
      "\"I did not say that to her,\" Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. \"I never had a private meeting with her. Other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say, I never said that.\"",
      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Later, Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia that he did not demand Monarez accept the recommendations of the panel without further review from career scientists at the CDC.",
      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed every member of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations. At the time, he asserted that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\" He then named several members to the panel, including vaccine skeptics, circumventing the usual CDC practice for selecting medical and public health experts.",
      "The newly constituted ACIP is set to meet later this month to consider vaccine recommendations. In her op-ed, Monarez wrote that \"[i]t is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.\"",
      "After Monarez's firing, several other top CDC officials resigned, citing the Trump administration's stance on vaccines, which they found troubling, and budget cuts.",

    "summary": "A large group of current and former HHS staffers are pushing for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired, after weeks of tumult at the health agency.",
    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy ousted every member of a CDC panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations earlier this year, in some cases replacing them with people who have questioned the safety of vaccines.",
      "And last week, the FDA only authorized a set of updated COVID-19 vaccines for younger adults and children with preexisting health conditions, in addition to all seniors.",

      "In states with higher taxes, the total yearly payments would add up to less in states with higher taxes.

    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",

      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",

We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:35:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Employers added far fewer jobs last month than economists had predicted, prompting some experts to reassess the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Many economists say Friday's disappointing jobs report\u00a0is sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. and the broader health of the economy.",
      "Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, far short of Wall Street analyst forecasts of 80,000, while the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% \u2014 the highest level since October of 2021, when the economy was still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. In 2024, the economy added an average of 168,000 per month, labor data shows.",
      "The job market is faltering partly because of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty, boosting costs for importers and complicating business planning.. Some economists also think that rapid employer adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for recent college graduates and other entry-level workers, although there is ongoing debate among researchers about how much AI is affecting job growth.",
      "\"Uncertainty makes it very, very difficult for people in companies to make decisions,\" Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job-search firm Indeed and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"My former boss says that when you are driving through fog, you slow down \u2014 but if it gets thick enough, you pull over.\"",
      "The Trump administration defended its trade and other economic policies, expressing confidence they will eventually drive growth.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",
      "Here are three key takeaways from economists about the latest employment figures.",
      "The job market is stalling",
      "Overall hiring in August was far weaker than economists expected. More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "summary": "The latest employment data could inform the Federal Reserve's next rate decision meeting, set for Sept. 17.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

      "North Dakotans are perhaps the most realistic about their chances of winning. They spent just $50 on lottery tickets in 2023, the lowest of any other state.",

    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him, famously created luxury looks for Hollywood stars, while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Transportation is dropping a proposed rule that would have required airlines to offer cash to passengers whose flights were disrupted.",
      "The rule, which never went into effect, would have required carriers to provide compensation \"to mitigate passenger inconveniences\" for cancellations or delays that were within a carrier's control.",
      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",
      "The proposal was introduced under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. It would've required airlines to pay up to $300 for domestic delays of three to six hours and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "\"The ability of airlines to choose the services that they provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from flight disruptions under current U.S. law contrasts with consumer protection regimes in other jurisdiction,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told CBS News: \"We will faithfully implement all aviation consumer protection requirements mandated by Congress, including the requirement to refund ticket prices to passengers in the case of airline canceled or substantially delayed flights when consumers choose not to travel. Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",
      "Airlines were opposed to the proposed regulation when it was announced in December. At the time, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the nation's carriers, said it would \"drive up ticket prices, make air travel less accessible for price-sensitive travelers and negatively impact carrier operations.\"",
      "The group on Thursday cheered the Transportation Department's decision to drop the compensation proposal.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this Department of Transportation reviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don't solve issues important to our customers,\" Airlines for America said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with DOT on implementing President Trump's deregulatory agenda.\"",
      "The DOT is also reviewing what types of flight cancellations trigger refunds for consumers, and is considering repealing a Biden-era rule that requires airlines to disclose ancillary fees upfront to help consumers avoid unexpected charges.",

      "For Musk to earn the full pay package, Tesla would have to reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 about eight times its current value \u2014 in 10 years. At that level, the stock awarded to Musk would be worth more than $1 trillion.",
      "Tesla would also need to hit certain operational targets for Musk to collect the full pay package. Those include delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million of the automaker's self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development.",
      "Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan.",
      "The company's new compensation scheme \"represents a critical next step to keep Musk as CEO at least until 2030,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a report, adding that Tesla is \"heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep.\"",
      "The entrepreneur's previous compensation has drawn legal challenges. In 2018, Tesla investors filed a lawsuit challenging Musk's $56 billion pay package, alleging that he and the company's board had breached their fiduciary duties. In December, a Delaware judge ordered the company to revoke that award.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-refunds-court-ruling-business-refunds/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:01:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "Spirit Airlines is ending flight service in a dozen cities less than a week after the discount carrier announced it was filing for bankruptcy for a second time this year.",
      "The Florida company confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that it would exit the following markets on Oct. 2: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Oakland, California; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; and San Jose, California. The airline also said it is nixing plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia, which was slated for Oct. 16.",
      "Spirit serves dozens of cities in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, according to its route map.",
      "\"We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience this may cause and will reach out to those with affected reservations to notify them of their options, including a refund,\" a Spirit spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement.",
      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes. In its quarterly earnings report in August, the company said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to stay in business, citing factors including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and \"adverse market conditions.\"",
      "Rival airlines swoop in",
      "Rival airlines reacted quickly by announcing new lineups of domestic flights and international flights as they sought to gain some of the market share left in Spirit's absence.",
      "United Airlines, the world's largest airline carrier, said in an email statement that it would add flights to 15 cities starting Jan. 6 including trips to and from Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Las Vegas.",
      "\"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in the company's statement.",
      "In response to United's statement, a spokesperson for Spirit said, \"While we appreciate the obsession certain airline executives have with us, we're focused on competing and running a great operation.\" Spirit plans to continue offering low fares to customers \"for many years to come,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines, a low-cost airline carrier based out of Denver, announced it was introducing 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. The flights range in price from $29 to $89.",

      "The 2026-2027 GoWild! pass is valid for 20 months and can be used immediately, marking the longest travel window since Frontier launched the program in 2022. Previously, the pass would have only been valid for trips beginning in May 2026, according to the airline.",
      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/august-jobs-report-labor-market-bureau-labor-statistics/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase.

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year.

      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",

      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin this morning with the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good morning and thank you for being here.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Yes I agree with this article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical that we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Other ways to implement tariffs. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- But it might be like, yeah, too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday. But, but yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you, it's great to be here."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

But she outlined that \"we don't have any indications\" that the administration is getting ready to send troops into the nation's third-largest city, despite signals in recent weeks that he is preparing to do so.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Duckworth said of Mr. Trump's statements on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"This is not acceptable behavior.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that read \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" alongside an AI-generated image that appeared to be inspired by the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, though a formal name change would have to go through Congress. He is expected to seek congressional approval.",
      "The post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago. The comments came one day after Mr. Trump again suggested he would send federal forces to Chicago, saying \"we're going in.\"",
      "Still, Duckworth said she takes what the president says seriously.",
      "\"I take what the president of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,\" Duckworth said. \"And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear: it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.\"",
      "Duckworth was among a group of Illinois leaders who visited the Naval Station Great Lakes Saturday, following news that some federal immigration enforcement agents will be based there. She said military leadership confirmed that the only assistance they've been requested to provide to the federal government is for office space for ICE.",
      "\"No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago,\" Duckworth said.",
      "The Illinois Democrat said \"we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing,\" adding that the administration hasn't reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate.",

      "The developments come after Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C. last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, while vowing to intervene in cities like Chicago and Baltimore next.",
      "Local leaders have pushed back on the federal government's threats to intervene on crime in Chicago, which could draw legal challenges.",

    "story": [
      "Amy Coney Barrett had been teaching full-time for nearly two decades, at Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana, until she was selected by President Donald Trump, in 2020,  to serve on the Supreme Court. Now, she's traded the classroom for the courtroom, although she continues to teach a weeklong seminar on Constitutional Law.",
      "In her first television interview since she filled the seat left by the  late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett was asked whether she believed  the Court has shifted to the right. \"I think shifting to the right, or  shifting to the left, I think those are other  people's labels, and that's other people's game,\" she said. \"I don't  think of it that way. You know, I just decide the cases as they come.  I've been criticized by both the right and the left.\"",
      "Justice Barrett's legal philosophy and personal story are the focus of her new book, \"Listening to the Law,\"\u00a0out on September 9. In it, she writes that, for her, the past five years  have not been easy since joining the Supreme Court: \"I'm happiest with  my old friends who knew me before I became Justice Barrett, and I am  wistful when we're back in South Bend.\"",
      "But she does not regret joining the High Court. \"No, I don't regret it,\"  she said. \"And I think it's really important work, and I'm proud to  serve. And we do have a good life in Washington, and we have friends in  Washington. But there is something nice about  our old life.\"",
      "Observers at the Supreme Court describe the 53-year-old mother of seven  as \"the most influential justice\" on the court today. Among the most  notable instances of that was her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned nearly 50 years of precedent surrounding the right to an abortion.",
      "For the minority's dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote:",
      "\"[T]he Court may face questions about the application of abortion  regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from  abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro  fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation  or medication for miscarriage management?\"",
      "Asked whether she sees those issues coming about now as a result of  Dobbs, Barrett replied, \"Those are issues inherent in medical practice.  And sure, they surround pregnancy care and the care of women. And those  are issues that are left now to the democratic  process. And the states are working those out. We have not had those  cases on our docket.\"",
      "But, Barrett added, \"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did  not say anything about whether abortion is immoral. Dobbs said that  these are questions that are left to the states. And all of these kinds  of questions \u2013 decisions that you mention that  require medical judgments \u2013 are not ones that our Constitution connects  to the courts, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of  abortion might extend. You know, the court was in the business of  drawing a lot of those lines before, and what Dobbs  says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process.  And the states have been working those out. There's been a lot of  legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since  the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",

      "For some, Dobbs raised concerns about the future of other rights. In  an  appearance on the Raging Moderates podcast\u00a0last month,  former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton predicted that the Court \"will  do to gay marriage what they did to abortion.\"",
      "Barrett said, \"Well, I think people who criticize the Court or who are  outside, say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make  in the book is that we have to tune those things out.\"",
      "She also notes in her book that the rights to marry and engage in sexual  intimacy, to use birth control, and to raise children are, in her  words, \"fundamental.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Barrett said. \"Again, I'm describing what our doctrine is. And that is what we've said.\"",
      "Ruling on Trump's policies",
      "At issue now: cases on the \"emergency docket,\" challenging Mr. Trump's  executive orders. The nation's highest court has routinely allowed the  president's policies (including on immigration\u00a0and mass layoffs of federal workers) to temporarily  proceed.",

      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "Barrett was asked to respond to Court observers who say that Mr. Trump  is pushing the boundaries of executive power, even overreaching, and  that the Supreme Court is not providing an adequate check on that.",
      "\"The Supreme Court, you know \u2013 and I can speak for myself and the way  that I make these decisions \u2013 it's not our job to survey and decide  whether, you know, the current occupant of an office in this particular  moment is, you know, to form a political view.  You know, that's the job of journalists, that's the job of other  politicians, or that's the job of the people. But our job is to decide  these legal questions.",
      "\"And so, in the cases that we've decided, what I can say, and what I try  to explain in the book, is that we're trying to get the law right,\" she  said.",
      "One White House policy that has faced pushback from federal courts is  the president's deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities,  such as Los Angeles and Chicago. On August 26, Mr. Trump said, \"Not  that I don't have \u2013 I would \u2013 the right to do anything I want to do. I'm  the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger  \u2014 and it is in danger in these cities \u2014 I can  do it.\"",

      "Judge rules Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law",
      "Asked if she thought the president is right when he says he has  unlimited power to deploy the National Guard in any state, Barrett  replied, \"So, we don't have any cases pending before us that I'm aware  of. I would not be surprised if there are some cases pending  below. And so, I can't answer that question. But actually, this is a  good opportunity for me to say why\u00a0I can't answer that question, because it's something I cover  in the book. Any particular legal issue, I mean, I might be sitting  there with my kids and watching TV, and I might have an idea about it.  But if I'm going to decide something as a judge,  it really has to happen in the context of a particular case, because  judges have to approach things with an open mind on a specific set of  facts. We read briefs. I listen to oral argument. I talk to my law  clerks. I write out notes. I look at the cases. I  talk to my colleagues. And at any step of that process, I might change  my mind from my initial reaction. In fact, I often do.",
      "\"And so not only should I not, but I don't think you would want me to be  in a position where I would just shoot from the hip and say, 'Oh yeah. I  think that's constitutional,' or, 'Oh no. I think that's not.' That  really kind of the opposite of the judicial  rule,\" she said.",
      "\"But you are a scholar of the Constitution,\" O'Donnell said, \"so I do  also want to ask you, do you believe that the power to impose tariffs is  something the Constitution gives to the president, or is that left to  Congress?\"",
      "\"Ugh, and I have to give the same answer again, because that one  actually is pending in the courts, and we may well (dare I say likely  will) see that case,\" Barrett replied. \"And so, same thing goes. You  know, that's the kind of thing that's a wait-and-see.  I'm not trying to hide the ball. And I'm sure that not only you, but  probably others would be interested in, you know, what I think about  that question. I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can  honestly say. You know, stay tuned. If that case  comes before us, and after I dive in and read all the relevant  authorities, then I'll draw a conclusion.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:00:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump's approval rating ticks back up; support for tariffs declines as some pull back buying.",
    "story": [
      "The National Guard was deployed to Washington, D.C., and reportedly may be sent to other cities. But wherever Americans live, it is speaking to larger issues \u2013 ranging from crime and their safety, to rights and freedoms and their views on the powers of a president.",
      "Those in favor of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to cities are largely in his Republican base and say it reduces crime, feel it makes them personally safer \u2014 even if they don't live in cities \u2014 and that in principle they'd support deployment to other U.S. cities.",
      "The majority of Americans are opposed, though, and those who are, tend to feel their own rights and freedoms would be less secure as a result. They do not think it would be effective at reducing crime or make them any safer.",
      "To those in favor, it's not a case of red-versus-blue cities. They'd support the Guard being sent to either Democratic- or Republican-led places, or coming to their own local area as well.",
      "To those opposed, they believe the president is acting out of politics more than crime prevention.",
      "People who live in cities generally oppose the idea of sending troops to other cities and Americans in rural areas are mostly in favor of sending the Guard to other cities. Opinion is more tied to partisanship than geography, though.",
      "The people who think the presence of the National Guard does reduce crime, but still oppose the deployment to Washington or elsewhere, tend to see Trump acting for political reasons, not just crime prevention.",
      "The bulk of Americans, wherever they stand on this deployment, think in principle, both the president and a local leader like a mayor or governor should have the authority to deploy the National Guard. Fewer \u2014 including a lot of those opposed \u2014 think it should be only a local leader. Very few think it should be only Donald Trump.",
      "Approval ratings",
      "The policy on which one judges a president can of course affect the overall evaluation of him.",
      "Republicans, and Trump's supporters overall, say they're judging him on immigration and deportation policy more than on his economy and inflation policies; that topic, plus crime, together far outpaces inflation and the economy as their most important metric.",
      "Of late, the deployments may have the political effect of focusing on matters other than inflation, at least for the president's political base. And that in turn has helped his overall numbers a bit.",
      "His Republican approval now ticks back up over 90%, and his overall approval has stabilized, up two points now, after steadily declining over the weeks and months of his term.",
      "Meanwhile, those judging him on economic and inflation policies don't approve of him overall or on the matter of inflation, specifically.",
      "The relatively small group of people who disapprove of him on inflation, but approve on immigration, mostly approve of him overall.",
      "Tariffs",
      "Economic matters remain tougher for Mr. Trump, as they have been. Many continue to say Trump's policies have made them financially worse off.",
      "Four in 10 Americans report buying fewer things because of tariffs.",
      "Support for tariffs continues to drop incrementally, if steadily.",
      "And as with many other items, support for tariffs is centered in the Republican and MAGA political base, but not elsewhere.",
      "That extends to a call for some financial sacrifice, too. Seven in 10 Republicans say Americans should be willing to pay more for what they buy to support Trump's trade policies. This is true for Republicans across income levels.",
      "On balance, people overall are mixed about the potential impact on manufacturing jobs. Relatively more do think the tariffs will lead to manufacturing jobs more than will lead to losses, and Republicans are also the most likely to think this.",
      "Views of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act remain underwater and its approval rating is unchanged from July, shortly after it was signed into law.",
      "The Fed",
      "Most Americans continue to call for a Federal Reserve that operates independently of what Donald Trump wants.",
      "Unlike matters related to immigration or the National Guard, there is a bit of difference within the GOP ranks. MAGA Republicans specifically would like the Fed more under Trump's guidance than non-MAGA Republicans. Nor would all Republicans have Trump replace Fed members who disagree with him.",
      "Trump's approach",
      "All of these matters also speak to questions of executive power and how it is applied.",
      "In all, as a general description, people tend to like Trump's goals relatively more than his approach.",
      "In general, two-thirds of Americans feel Donald Trump is trying to increase the powers of a president. That's not collectively what they'd want; most would say not to change those powers.",
      "And while Democrats see an approach they'd describe as Trump trying to bring the federal government more under his direct control, Republicans describe him trying to make it work more efficiently.",

      "\"There's certainly folks \u2014 folks who may have been not thinking about those kinds of issues who are starting to think about them,\" Gifford, who was named chairman of the library board, told The Associated Press. \"That being said ... we're not going to create a budget, we're not going to set a goal for ourselves that we don't believe we can hit.\"",
      "The cost of presidential libraries has soared over the decades.",
      "The George H.W. Bush library's construction cost came in at about $43 million when it opened in 1997. Bill Clinton's cost about $165 million. George W. Bush's team met its $500 million fundraising goal before the library was dedicated.",

      "Biden advisers have met with officials operating 12 of the 13 presidential libraries with a bricks-and-mortar presence that the National Archives and Records Administration manages. (They skipped the Herbert Hoover library in Iowa, which is closed for renovations.) They've also met Obama library officials to discuss programming and location considerations and have begun talks with Delaware leaders to assess potential partnerships.",
      "Private money builds libraries",
      "Construction and support for programming for the libraries are paid for with private funds donated to the nonprofit organizations established by the former president.",
      "The initial vision is for the Biden library to include an immersive museum detailing Biden's four years in office.",

    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",
      "The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county's Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.",

      "The email from a top ICE official noted that Abrego Garcia's attorneys have warned he fears being persecuted or tortured in Uganda, where federal authorities threatened to deport him last month after he was detained once again by immigration officials following his release from criminal custody.",
      "The ICE official said Abrego Garcia, through his attorneys, has also claimed fear of being harmed if deported to more than 20 countries, most of them in Latin America.",
      "In the email, the official called the alleged claims \"hard to take seriously,\" but added: \"Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa.\"",

      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination that the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face federal smuggling charges.",
      "Africa's sole remaining absolute monarchy, Eswatini is one of several nations that has agreed to the Trump administration's requests to accept deportees who are not their citizens from the U.S. Earlier this year, the U.S. sent a small group of deportees from Asia and Latin America who had been convicted of violent crimes to Eswatini. Attorneys say the men are being held incommunicado in a prison there.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial jail last month, but ICE almost immediately detained him during a check-in appointment with the agency in Baltimore and began processing him for deportation to Uganda. His attorneys have fought that move, and alleged the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica instead if he agreed to a plea deal in his smuggling case.",
      "And on Thursday, federal authorities argued they could have a legal route to deport him to El Salvador a second time. A 2019 immigration court ruling barred the government from sending him to the Central American country, citing a risk of persecution by gangs. But in a filing obtained by CBS News, the government argued those legal protections would be voided if Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration court case is granted.",
      "Despite that legal protection issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, which government lawyers acknowledged was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "A senior Trump administration official said, \"Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are playing with fire. If their attempts to reopen his immigration case are successful, his own lawyers will have opened the door for his return to El Salvador.\"",

      "The administration argued that Abrego Garcia is not eligible for asylum and other benefits, citing his alleged affiliation with the gang MS-13, his smuggling charges and a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife. The government alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of a foreign terrorist group, since MS-13 has been classified as such by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has strongly denied any affiliation with MS-13 and has pleaded not guilty to his smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"vindictive and selective.\" Abrego Garcia's wife filed a protective order alleging domestic violence in 2021, but she later said she decided not to follow through with the case. Abrego Garcia was not criminally charged in the matter.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CBS News that if his client \"is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there's no way he's not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.\"",

    "summary": "Judge Edward Chen ruled against the Trump administration in a challenge to its effort to end the Temporary Protected Status program for roughly 1 million Venezuelan and Haitian migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ruled Friday that the Trump administration's attempt to end the Temporary Protected Status program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants was unlawful.",
      "The move by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively sets aside the administration's attempt to end temporary legal protections and work permits for certain people from Venezuela and Haiti \u2014 unless his ruling is overturned on appeal. Chen ruled in favor of the National TPS Alliance, an organization that represents TPS holders across the country, and a group of Venezuelan migrants who received protections under the program.",
      "\"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,\" Chen wrote in a 69-page decision. \"The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law.\"",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, freezing an earlier ruling by Chen.",
      "Chen said that decision concerned only preliminary relief he ordered that postponed the Department of Homeland Security's actions. The high court's order, he said, did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits or issuing relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling in a statement, and said Noem will \"use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.\"",
      "\"For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program. Its use has been all the more dangerous given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country,\" the statement read.",
      "Congress in 1990 established the Temporary Protected Status program, which allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program lets TPS holders temporarily remain in the U.S. and apply for renewable work permits.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security designated Venezuela, which is the largest country included in the TPS program, covering roughly 600,000 migrants. It also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Biden administration had extended the TPS designations for Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "After President Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem first sought to reverse the TPS extension for Venezuela, and then moved to terminate the designation altogether. She also sought to unwind TPS protections for Haitians and migrants of several other countries.",
      "The National TPS Alliance and Venezuelan TPS holders filed their lawsuit challenging Noem's decisions in February and argued she did not have the authority to unilaterally roll back the extension granted by her predecessor.",
      "In his decision against the Trump administration, Chen said Noem's attempts to reverse the TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were \"extraordinary and unusual,\" and marked the first time in the program's 35-year-history that such a step had been taken. He called the decision-making process surrounding the move \"truncated and condensed,\" and said Noem failed to consult the appropriate agencies.",
      "\"As a matter of law, the Secretary lacked the implicit authority to vacate. Even if she had such authority, there is no genuine dispute that she exceeded that authority,\" he wrote.",

John Cornyn, but he's facing a primary challenge from his right in Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Talarico will also need to face off against several other Democratic primary hopefuls, including Rep. Colin Allred, who announced a bid for the seat in July.",
      "Members of both parties are taking a serious look at the race, given a clear weakness for Cornyn among base Republican voters in public and private polling. But recent surveys suggest Cornyn, who has served in the Senate since 2003, is keeping even or pacing ahead of Paxton. The state attorney general survived an impeachment trial in 2023, but his wife announced plans this summer to divorce him amid accusations of extramarital affairs.",

      "The executive order will allow the DOD to start using the term Department of War as a \"secondary title,\" and will let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title Secretary of War, according to a fact sheet obtained by CBS News. Other government agencies will be directed to \"recognize and accommodate\" those secondary titles.",
      "The order also instructs Hegseth to recommend \"legislative and executive actions\" to make the renaming effort permanent. The Pentagon is\u00a0currently officially\u00a0referred to\u00a0as the Department of Defense in federal law.",
      "In remarks at the White House Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump said the post-World War II decision to name it the Department of Defense was \"woke.\"",
      "The White House fact sheet argues the term Department of War \"conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve.\"",
      "\"It's gonna fight to win, not to lose. We're gonna go on offense, not just on defense,\" Hegseth said Friday, adding that the U.S. will \"raise up warriors, not just defenders.\"",
      "In a statement, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell called the new name \"a nod to our proud heritage\" and said, \"this change is essential because it reflects the Department's core mission: winning wars. This has always been our mission, and while we hope for peace, we will prepare for war. Defense isn't enough \u2014 we've got to be ready to strike and dominate our enemies.\"",
      "Plans for the executive order were first reported by Fox News Digital.",
      "The White House didn't immediately provide any information on how much a permanent renaming might cost, as everything from vehicles and stationery to email addresses and clothing would have to be redone.",
      "Asked by a reporter how much it would cost, Mr. Trump responded, \"Not a lot. You know, we know how to rebrand without having to go crazy. We don't have to re-carve a mountain or anything. ... We're going to start changing the stationery as it comes to, and lots of things like that. We're not going to be doing things like have been done in the past, when they change the name of forts that shouldn't have been changed.\"",

      "\"We want to be defensive, but we want to be offensive, too, if we have to be,\" the president said.",
      "When did the Department of War change to the Department of Defense?",
      "The department changed its name in the late 1940s, part of a larger post-World War II effort to reorganize the nation's military bureaucracy, cut redundancies and remove references to \"war\" after two deadly worldwide battles.",
      "Beginning in the 1790s, the U.S. military was split into two Cabinet-level agencies: a War Department that oversaw the Army, and a Navy Department that oversaw naval forces and the Marine Corps.

The justice has written a new book, called \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" that will hit shelves Sept. 9.",

The decision came in a trio of challenges to President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",

      "\"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,\" Barrett wrote. \"We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.\"",

      "\"I did draft the opinion and I think sometimes arguments that are, you know \u2014 you match the tone that's appropriate for the moment,\" Barrett said. \"And Justice Jackson made a formal, a very \u2014 she made a spirited argument, and so I thought it merited a spirited response. But it is about the merits, it was about the case. I have great respect for Justice Jackson.\"",

      "\"That is the spirit in which, you know, I write my opinions,\" she said.",
      "Asked if there was any \"beef\" with Jackson, Barrett replied, \"Of course not. No.\"",
      "\"One thing I want people to know about the court is that it's a place where we can have disagreements, but still get along, because we can have disagreements that really are confined to the page, that are confined to cases,\" she said. \"And so we can debate ideas, sometimes vigorously, as you pointed out, but it doesn't inhibit us in our ability to be colleagues and friends.\"",

      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",

      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",

      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",

      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

But she outlined that \"we don't have any indications\" that the administration is getting ready to send troops into the nation's third-largest city, despite signals in recent weeks that he is preparing to do so.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Duckworth said of Mr. Trump's statements on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"This is not acceptable behavior.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that read \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" alongside an AI-generated image that appeared to be inspired by the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, though a formal name change would have to go through Congress. He is expected to seek congressional approval.",
      "The post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago. The comments came one day after Mr. Trump again suggested he would send federal forces to Chicago, saying \"we're going in.\"",
      "Still, Duckworth said she takes what the president says seriously.",
      "\"I take what the president of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,\" Duckworth said. \"And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear: it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.\"",
      "Duckworth was among a group of Illinois leaders who visited the Naval Station Great Lakes Saturday, following news that some federal immigration enforcement agents will be based there. She said military leadership confirmed that the only assistance they've been requested to provide to the federal government is for office space for ICE.",
      "\"No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago,\" Duckworth said.",

Now, she's traded the classroom for the courtroom, although she continues to teach a weeklong seminar on Constitutional Law.",
      "In her first television interview since she filled the seat left by the  late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett was asked whether she believed  the Court has shifted to the right. \"I think shifting to the right, or  shifting to the left, I think those are other  people's labels, and that's other people's game,\" she said. \"I don't  think of it that way. You know, I just decide the cases as they come.  I've been criticized by both the right and the left.\"",
      "Justice Barrett's legal philosophy and personal story are the focus of her new book, \"Listening to the Law,\"\u00a0out on September 9. In it, she writes that, for her, the past five years  have not been easy since joining the Supreme Court: \"I'm happiest with  my old friends who knew me before I became Justice Barrett, and I am  wistful when we're back in South Bend.\"",
      "But she does not regret joining the High Court. \"No, I don't regret it,\"  she said. \"And I think it's really important work, and I'm proud to  serve. And we do have a good life in Washington, and we have friends in  Washington. But there is something nice about  our old life.\"",
      "Observers at the Supreme Court describe the 53-year-old mother of seven  as \"the most influential justice\" on the court today. Among the most  notable instances of that was her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned nearly 50 years of precedent surrounding the right to an abortion.",
      "For the minority's dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote:",
      "\"[T]he Court may face questions about the application of abortion  regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from  abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro  fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation  or medication for miscarriage management?\"",
      "Asked whether she sees those issues coming about now as a result of  Dobbs, Barrett replied, \"Those are issues inherent in medical practice.  And sure, they surround pregnancy care and the care of women. And those  are issues that are left now to the democratic  process. And the states are working those out. We have not had those  cases on our docket.\"",
      "But, Barrett added, \"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did  not say anything about whether abortion is immoral. Dobbs said that  these are questions that are left to the states. And all of these kinds  of questions \u2013 decisions that you mention that  require medical judgments \u2013 are not ones that our Constitution connects  to the courts, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of  abortion might extend. You know, the court was in the business of  drawing a lot of those lines before, and what Dobbs  says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process.  And the states have been working those out. There's been a lot of  legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since  the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",

      "Barrett said, \"Well, I think people who criticize the Court or who are  outside, say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make  in the book is that we have to tune those things out.\"",
      "She also notes in her book that the rights to marry and engage in sexual  intimacy, to use birth control, and to raise children are, in her  words, \"fundamental.\"",

I would not be surprised if there are some cases pending  below. And so, I can't answer that question. But actually, this is a  good opportunity for me to say why\u00a0I can't answer that question, because it's something I cover  in the book. Any particular legal issue, I mean, I might be sitting  there with my kids and watching TV, and I might have an idea about it.  But if I'm going to decide something as a judge,  it really has to happen in the context of a particular case, because  judges have to approach things with an open mind on a specific set of  facts. We read briefs. I listen to oral argument. I talk to my law  clerks. I write out notes. I look at the cases. I  talk to my colleagues. And at any step of that process, I might change  my mind from my initial reaction. In fact, I often do.",
      "\"And so not only should I not, but I don't think you would want me to be  in a position where I would just shoot from the hip and say, 'Oh yeah. I  think that's constitutional,' or, 'Oh no. I think that's not.' That  really kind of the opposite of the judicial  rule,\" she said.",
      "\"But you are a scholar of the Constitution,\" O'Donnell said, \"so I do  also want to ask you, do you believe that the power to impose tariffs is  something the Constitution gives to the president, or is that left to  Congress?\"",
      "\"Ugh, and I have to give the same answer again, because that one  actually is pending in the courts, and we may well (dare I say likely  will) see that case,\" Barrett replied. \"And so, same thing goes. You  know, that's the kind of thing that's a wait-and-see.  I'm not trying to hide the ball. And I'm sure that not only you, but  probably others would be interested in, you know, what I think about  that question. I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can  honestly say.

    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On August 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",

      "Over 1,000 HHS staffers call on Trump to fire RFK Jr. for \"endangering the nation's health\"",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2013 not skeptics \u2013 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2013 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2013 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2013 now featuring Kennedy appointees \u2013 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

      "Notre Dame law professor Amy Coney Barrett was serving on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Indiana when she was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump in 2020. In her new memoir, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\" (to be published September 9 by Sentinel), Barrett writes of the decision she and her family made to \"burn the boats\" upon being asked to serve on the High Court.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Justice Barrett on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" September 7!",
      "\"Listening to the Law\" by Amy Coney Barrett",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "I really loved my job on the Seventh Circuit and settled into the rhythm of hearing arguments and writing opinions. But after a few years, life took another turn: the White House counsel, who runs the judicial selection process for the president, invited me on behalf of President Trump to interview for a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Though I was deeply honored, I thought hard about whether to go forward. I knew that if I was chosen, both the confirmation process and the work of serving on the Court would require sacrifices, particularly from my family. Unlike my job on the Seventh Circuit, this one would require a move to Washington, D.C. We had a good life, wonderful friends, and close family in South Bend. We were attached to our old Prairie-style home, which was a short walk to campus for tailgates during football season\u2014a fall family high- light. The move would mean changes for Jesse's career and new schools for the children. We knew that public criticism was sure to come. And if I was nominated and confirmed, there would be a long-term loss of privacy for all of us. Public service was appealing, but the changes to our personal life were not.",
      "In fact, I felt a pit in my stomach when I considered what might lie ahead. I had been considered for a seat on the Court two years earlier, when Justice Anthony Kennedy retired. Being a finalist had thrust me into the spotlight, which (to put it mildly) was not enjoyable. There had been an avalanche of news stories and social media posts\u2014true and untrue, kind and cruel. It was difficult to have my life so publicly picked apart. There had also been a loss of physical privacy. Multiple camera crews parked outside our house and followed me by car when I pulled out of the driveway. I had one experience, funny only in retrospect, of realizing that I had been followed to church on a Sunday morning. I spent the whole Mass, not in prayer, but plotting an escape\u2014a plan that culminated in my sneaking out a side door, scaling a fence in high heels, and\u2014to the surprise of the associate pastor sitting on the rectory porch\u2014dropping into the priests' vegetable garden. (He was a happy co-conspirator; he took my keys and retrieved my car from the parking lot, allowing me to avoid the camera after all.) The scrutiny had affected my family too\u2014given the number of strangers who had started walking past and driving by our house, Jesse and I were reluctant to let our kids play in the yard. It was not an experience I was eager to repeat.",
      "Jesse and I had a very brief time to make one of the biggest decisions in our marriage. His position was full support on one condition: if we did it, we had to \"burn the boats.\" The phrase comes from a military strategy used by Alexander the Great, who, after landing on the shores of enemy territory, ordered his men to burn the ships they had come in. With the option of exit gone, there was no choice but to forge ahead, no matter the challenge. Likewise for us. There would be difficulties in store, some we could anticipate and others we couldn't. Jesse wisely thought that it would be unsustainable to face the difficulties\u2014whether in the confirmation process or beyond\u2014if we gave ourselves the option to look back, wishing that we could unwind what we had done. There would be no second-guessing and no turning back to our comfortable life in South Bend.",
      "So despite what might seem like a self-evident decision from the outside, saying yes to the interview, and then to the nomination, was not an easy call. I had just watched Brett Kavanaugh, whom I knew and respected, undergo a brutal confirmation process, and I was afraid of what I might face. I was reluctant to give up the good life we had for one that might prove to be less happy. Yet it seemed cowardly to bow out because we didn't want to make the sacrifice. As I later told the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe deeply in the rule of law and the Supreme Court's role in preserving it; I also think that Americans of all backgrounds deserve an independent Supreme Court that interprets our Constitution and laws as they are written. It seemed strange to hold those views and be unwilling to serve, given that any nominee would face the same hardships. I accepted the interview and flew to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Trump. He announced my nomination on September 26, 2020, and the Senate confirmed me a month later. I have served as an associate justice since.",

      "During the raid on Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally, authorities said at the time. According to South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, more than 300 of the detained workers were South Korean nationals.",

They worked for different companies, including subcontractors, Schrank said.",
      "The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site that state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project.",

He described the raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit within ICE.",
      "Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside.

      "Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman accused of setting a fire to her family home and murdering her husband, discusses her case in her only broadcast interview with \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty in \"The Death of Todd Stermer,\" reairing Saturday, Sept. 6 at 10/9c on CBS.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2007, Linda Stermer says she was doing laundry in the basement of her family's Michigan home when she heard her husband Todd Stermer let out a chilling scream and ran upstairs to find their living room engulfed in flames. Todd Stermer, says Linda, was in the middle of the room attempting to fight the fire. Unable to get to him, she says she fled the burning house with no shoes, jacket or cellphone.",
      "In an interview for \"48 Hours,\" correspondent Erin Moriarty asks Linda Stermer, \"You didn't think about calling 911?\" \"That wasn't my first thought,\" Linda Stermer replies. \u00a0\"My first thought was to get out. Todd's gonna get out \u2026 As long as he knows I'm out \u2026 he's gonna get out.\"",
      "The Stermer home was in a rural area outside Kalamazoo, Michigan, with an electrified fence surrounding the large property to help keep the couple's 31 horses safe. Without a cellphone, Linda Stermer says the only way for her to get help that day was to jump into her husband's van, which always had the keys inside, and drive to the nearest neighbor. But just as she was about to take off in the van, she says she saw that her husband had escaped the burning house, and that she got out of the van to help him. \"He's jumping around and he's patting himself. His skin is burnt terribly \u2026 I'm screaming at him, get in the van ... And he won't get in the van,\" Linda Stermer tells Moriarty. \"I can't touch him \u2026 And, so, I get back in the van \u2026 And I lost sight of him.\"",
      "According to weather reports for that day, there was some light rain and snow in the area. Linda Stermer says their driveway was so wet and muddy that it was hard for her to get the van moving. \"The tires were just spinning \u2026 so I couldn't get any traction,\" she says \u2014 but what happened next is something she still cannot explain. \"Did you know you had run over your husband,\" asks Moriarty. \"No,\" says Linda Stermer. Investigators would later find Todd's blood on the van's front bumper and undercarriage. Linda Stermer had hit her husband with his own van.",
      "Emergency workers tried to save Todd Stermer, but he died on the scene from his burn injuries. Van Buren County sheriff's detectives investigated the fire and Todd's death for a little over two years. Then, on June 5, 2009, the prosecutor's office felt it had enough evidence to arrest Linda Stermer and charge her with arson and the murder of her husband. Linda Stermer maintains she is innocent, but the couple's sons say that over time they came to feel that their mother was guilty.",
      "\"What do you believe happened,\" Moriarty asks 28-year-old Trevor Stermer.",
      "\"Our mother murdered our father,\" he replies. \"She set the house on fire, doused him in gasoline, then after the fact when he managed to get out of the house, she ran him over with her van.\"",
      "The evidence presented at trial was mainly circumstantial. Among other things, a gas station clerk testified that she saw Linda Stermer on the morning of the fire seemingly pumping gas into a gas can at the back of her SUV. Her sons testified that when Linda got home from the gas station, she woke them and gave them money to go to the movies. A former close friend testified that Linda Stermer had talked about wanting to kill Todd Stermer by running him over, and accused Linda of having an affair with a coworker.",
      "Linda Stermer's defense countered with testimony from the brother of that former friend, who told the jury that his sister has a history of psychiatric illness and cannot be trusted.\u00a0 As for pumping gas into a can that morning, Linda Stermersays it was cold out and she went to the back of her SUV to get gloves to pump gas into her car. Nothing more. She also insists that the reason she sent her sons to the movies that day is that she and Todd were in the throes of a heated argument. She was planning on leaving Todd that day, says Linda, and did not want her sons there to see it.",
      "On Jan. 13, 2010, the jury convicted Linda Stermer. A month later, she was sentenced to life in prison without parole \u2014 but after serving nearly 9 years, she was once again free, at least temporarily.",
      "Erin Moriarty and I first met Linda Stermer and her new attorney Wolfgang Mueller at the 2019 Innocence Network Conference. A federal judge had overturned Linda's conviction in December \u00a02018 and set her free. Judge Arthur J. Tarnow declared that Linda did not get a fair trial and said he found prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.",
      "The State of Michigan immediately filed an appeal to reinstate Linda's conviction and put her back behind bars. Prosecutors declared that if they lost, they would retry her.",
      "On May 15, 2020, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Linda Stermer and upheld Judge Tarnow's decision to overturn her conviction. The Van Buren County Prosecutor's office then refiled murder charges against Stermer.",
      "Through the next nearly five years of pretrial hearings and delays, Linda Stermer remained a free woman. Then, on March 27, 2025, she was back in court facing a second jury of her peers.",
      "In a family divided, Linda's sons testified against her. Their half-sisters \u2014 Linda's daughters from a previous marriage, Ashley and Brittany \u2014 believe their mother is innocent and say they prayed that she would remain free. But after seven-and-a-half hours of deliberation, a jury of six men and six women once again found Linda Stermer guilty of the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer. Stermer is now serving a mandatory life sentence, without the possibility of parole.",

      "When Linda first met Todd in 1989, she says there was an instant attraction.",
      "Linda Stermer: He was so beautiful, so charismatic. You could just see the light in his eyes.",
      "They were both 25 when they started dating. Linda was separated at the time, with two young daughters: 3-year-old Ashley and 2-year-old Brittany. It was clear Todd wanted the whole package.",
      "Linda Stermer: I said, \"I'm in the middle of a divorce,\" and I said, \"I have two little girls.\" And he says, \"Well, that's perfect. I'll only make boys.\" [laughs] Like, what?",
      "By the time they got married in August of 1993, Linda had given birth to their two sons, Trevor and Trenton.",
      "Linda Stermer: He did not have to marry me. \u2026 We just wanted to be a family. \u2026 Todd was the epitome of family.",
      "Trenton Stermer: He was a great man, great father. Coached all of us through as many sports as he could \u2026 and definitely a family man.",
      "He was such a devoted family man, says Linda, he even offered to take in her nephew, Cory, to save him from a broken home.",
      "Linda Stermer: Todd sat me down one night and he said, \"Do you want him to come and live here with us? Maybe that would be good for him.\"",

      "Cory Pierce: Yeah. \u2026 He loved to play sports with us and hang out with us, he'd go out in the yard to play with us and he was really athletic.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did he ever treat any of these kids differently?",
      "Linda Stermer: Oh, no. Anybody who he had ever, ever introduced his family to \u2014 \"these are my sons, these are my daughters.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: It sounds at that point your relationship was pretty ideal.",
      "Linda Stermer: Amazing. It was amazing.",
      "But that happiness, says Linda, didn't last very long. It turns out Todd had a temper.",
      "Ashley Gibson | Daughter: The first incident I just remember my stepdad, like, throwing a clothes basket of laundry \u2026 at my mom. I remember him going out with friends at night and my mom having to load all of us kids up in the car to go pick him up at a friend's house where he was drunk and just belligerent and screaming at her and ...",
      "Brittany Gibson | Daughter: It got like so bad. It scared us. We were young then.",
      "Ashley Gibson says that when she was about 11 years old and started speaking up, she became a target of that anger.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What would he say to you Ashley?",
      "Ashley Gibson: \"You're a two-legged dog just like your mom. You're gonna be a whore just like she is.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: Would he hit you?",
      "Ashley Gibson: Oh, yeah.",
      "Erin Moriarty: With what?",

      "Linda says Todd also hit her.",
      "Linda Stermer: It wasn't a regular thing. \u2026 He would get extremely fired up and extremely frustrated. And he hit me one time and left a bruise on my cheek. \u2026 But he sent me flowers. \u2026 He told me how sorry he was. \u2026 And then you believe that it's never going to happen again, until it does.",
      "But Trenton, Trevor and Cory say they never actually saw their father hit their sister, Ashley, or their mother.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did you see your dad ever be abusive to your mom?",
      "Cory Pierce: No. I never seen him physically harm her.",
      "Trenton Stermer: \u2026 we never saw a black eye or bruises.",
      "Trevor Stermer: Our father definitely had a temper. And perhaps he grabbed her and squeezed her arm maybe a little too hard \u2026 But never any hitting.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you really worried he might hurt Linda?",
      "Marti Bakhuyzen: Yes, I was.",
      "Linda says not long before the fire, she was ready to call it quits, and started talking to a divorce attorney.",
      "Brittany Gibson: She told me that she had planned on leaving \u2026 it was getting, you know, to be too much.",
      "On Jan. 6, 2007, the night before the fire, then-20-year-old Ashley says she called the Stermer home to speak to her mother.",
      "Ashley Gibson: I've never gotten to talk to anybody about this, so it's really hard for me \u2026",

      "THE CASE AGAINST LINDA STERMER",
      "After Todd Stermer's death, Van Buren County Sheriff's detectives spent two years investigating \u2014 focusing on the troubled Stermer marriage, and the fact that Todd's wife Linda ran him over when he escaped the fire.",
      "Then, on June 5, 2009, the prosecutor's office felt it had enough evidence to arrest Linda Stermer on charges of arson and murder.",
      "Trevor Stermer | Son: For so long we had all held the notion in our head that it was possible that she killed our father. \u2026 But when all the details and the evidence came out, it was just overwhelming.",
      "On Jan. 5, 2010, Linda went on trial. The evidence was mainly circumstantial, focusing on Linda's actions before and after the fire. Her sons testified she pushed them to go to the movies that Sunday morning.",
      "Trevor Stermer: Saying, \"You need to get up. \u2026 You need to go. You need to leave the house right now.\"",
      "Trenton Stermer: I went to go say goodbye to our father \u2014",
      "Trevor Stermer: \u2014she physically stopped us. She said, \"No he's sleeping. Don't go over there.\"",
      "They now believe their dad had been sedated.",
      "Trevor Stermer: I believe that he was drugged just because he was clearly incapacitated in the living room.",
      "Bolstering that theory was Kate Fox, a former friend and coworker of Linda's. Fox testified that Linda confided in her, saying she was afraid investigators would find a coffee cup she used to try to drug Todd.",
      "But Linda's trial attorney, Jeffrey Getting says, there was no evidence that Todd was drugged.",
      "Jeff Getting: The evidence introduced at the trial was \u2026 contained in the autopsy report, which didn't find any significant evidence of sedatives \u2026",
      "But Kate Fox also testified that Linda had discussed ways of getting rid of her husband, including running him over with a car.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did you?",
      "Linda Stermer: No. \u2026 Kate really hated me at that point.",
      "Linda says that by trial their friendship had ended, and that Fox lied on the witness stand because, among other things, she was angry at Linda for changing her shift at work.",
      "Linda Stermer: My lawyer asked her why she was so angry at me \u2026 And she says, \"she lied to me. She lied to me. She changed shifts without me.\"",
      "But Kate Fox also provided a motive for murder, telling jurors that, at the time of the fire, Linda was having an affair with a coworker named Chris Williams. That testimony was backed up by Williams himself, who claimed that he and Linda had a \"romantic relationship\" while she was \"a married woman.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you having an affair with Chris Williams?",
      "Linda Stermer:\u00a0 I started seeing Chris Williams romantically, but it wasn't until after I lost my husband.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why would a man you went out with turn around and lie at trial?",
      "Linda Stermer: Unless he was manipulated by someone, I don't know.",
      "Linda says that Kate Fox was so angry, she convinced Williams to lie about when the relationship began. The defense presented evidence that Fox had a history of mental illness and her own brother took the stand and said her stories couldn't be trusted.",
      "Stephen Berry | Kate Fox's brother: I do know my sister she can manipulate the \u2014 the truth to whatever she wants it to be. \u2026 And yeah, she will lie if it's \u2014 if it's to her benefit.",
      "But it may have been Linda's early morning trip to the gas station that was most damaging to her case.\u00a0 Remember, she says she went out to buy milk and top off the gas tank in her car. But a gas station clerk testified she thought she saw Linda at the back of her car, seemingly pumping gas not into her vehicle, but into a gas can, like the one found on the scene. It's something Linda denies.",
      "Linda Stermer: It was frigid. And I had winter gloves and a warmer coat back there. \u2026 So I got my gloves out to pump gas.",
      "As for the gas can found at the house, Linda says they lived on a farm, and there were gas cans everywhere.",
      "The prosecutor argued that Linda started the fire by dousing Todd with gasoline \u2014 and his sweatpants, underwear and socks did test positive. But defense attorney Getting never called his own fire expert to refute any of that.",
      "Linda Stermer: I begged him numerous times for an expert and he says, \"We don't need an expert, Linda. We will use their expert for our benefit,\"",
      "Getting says his plan was to agree the fire was arson, but to convince jurors that it was Todd who started it.",
      "Jeff Getting: Todd is in the middle of the fire. \u2026 The best defense in this case is Todd set the fire and was accidentally killed in the fire that he set.",
      "In fact, Todd Stermer had twice been suspected by police of arson in the past. Two other properties he owned mysteriously burned to the ground. Both times, Todd was reportedly in debt and needed money. But Todd was never charged, and in his closing argument, the prosecutor called the claim nonsense and reminded the jury that when Todd escaped the burning house, Linda ran him over. He also said Linda owned two cell phone and should have been able to call 911.",
      "Linda Stermer: And he pointed his finger in my face just inches away from my face. And he says, \"She's a liar, a manipulator, a diabolical murderer.\"",
      "That may have crossed a line but Getting never objected. Just hours after the case went to the jury, the judge read their verdict:",
      "JUDGE: Count one, guilty as charged. Count two, guilty as charged.",
      "Linda's sons say the jury got it right.",
      "Trenton Stermer: We knew it in our hearts that she was guilty. \u2026 And it felt like we could finally breathe again.",
      "Linda's daughter, Ashley, has barely spoken to her brothers since that day.",
      "Ashley Gibson: I lost my brothers, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles. \u2026 because I believed in my mom.",
      "Linda was sentenced to life without parole, but she was determined to fight her conviction and reunite her family:",
      "LINDA STERMER (in court): I am determined and hopeful that I will get back to my children someday.",
      "Determined to free her mother, Linda's daughter, Brittany, begged well-respected fire investigator Robert Trenkle to reexamine her mother's case.",
      "Brittany Gibson: He said, \"If there's any doubt in your mind at all whatsoever that your mom did this, don't hire me. \u2026 because if she did it, I will find out.\"",
      "LINDA PETITIONS THE COURT",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you went to prison, did you think, \"this is it?\"",
      "Linda Stermer: No. My lawyer told me, he says \u2026 \"Linda we will not give up. \u2026 We're going to fight this.\"",
      "Over the next 5 years, Linda Stermer filed appeal after appeal in state court, all the way to Michigan's Supreme Court; all of them denied.",
      "Linda Stermer: It was devastating. It was really devastating.",
      "Then she turned to the federal court and took advantage of a prison resource: the law library.",
      "Linda Stermer: I was in that law library almost every single day of the week. And I learned as much as I could.",
      "Linda wrote her own petition to the federal court. In part, she blamed her conviction on her own defense attorney, who had chosen not to hire a fire expert. An expert, like veteran fire investigator Robert Trenkle, who would have testified there wasn't enough evidence to prove the fire that killed Todd Stermer was deliberately set.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How would you describe the investigation that was made into this case? Adequate?",
      "Robert Trenkle: No, absolutely not adequate. Inadequate. Just the opposite.",
      "For example, Trenkle says, investigators failed to sift through the remains of the house and took very few samples of debris.",
      "Robert Trenkle: If you think the fire started the living room, it started in the center of that living room \u2026 you're going to have to take that floor and move it out to the outside. Look at what kind of burn patterns are on that floor to give you that reason to be able to believe that \u2026 and then take a sample and see if you have something.",
      "Trenkle says the evidence doesn't support the state's theory that Linda doused Todd with gasoline and then set him on fire.",
      "Robert Trenkle: I've asked probably 30 or 40 people who are firefighters, investigators \u2026 And they all laughed when I told them about somebody getting out of a building after they \u2026 had gasoline poured all over them.",
      "And when asked about the gasoline found on Todd's clothing? Well, Trenkle says it was likely a case of cross-contamination. Remember that neighbor who came to the rescue that day? He recycled auto parts for a living, and a shirt he used to cover Todd also tested positive for gas.",
      "And then there's the fact that no gasoline was found on Linda's clothing.",
      "Robert Trenkle: If you get one little speck on your finger, you try to wash it off and wash it off to wash it off, it's still there. So, it should've been smelled on Ms. Stermer. And it should certainly have been on something that she was wearing.",
      "Trenkle says there simply isn't enough evidence to prove arson, but even if there was, the more likely suspect was Todd Stermer himself.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And why do you believe that?",
      "Robert Trenkle: Because of his burn injuries \u2026 It certainly shows that Mr. Stermer was in the area of the fire.",
      "In 2016, an attorney filed Linda's amended petition, which included Trenkle's findings. Two years later, a judge responded \u2014 granting her another day in court.",
      "In October 2018, Federal Judge Arthur J. Tarnow held an evidentiary hearing in Linda's case.",
      "Linda Stermer: I knew that the science was the key. \u2026 There is no evidence to support a theory of arson.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you believe started that fire then?",
      "Linda Stermer: I believe that something came out of that fireplace - a coal or a log or something fell out, popped out, and started that floor on fire.",
      "The state's fire expert testified that he followed proper investigative procedures and didn't take samples of the remains because he saw no evidentiary value in them.",
      "When Jeff Getting took the stand to defend his work, the judge was quite stern with him.",
      "Jeff Getting: He was critical of me \u2026 He was critical of the entirety of \u2014 of this trial.",
      "But Getting says he still believes he presented the only case he could have\u2014that Todd Stermer started the fire that ended his life.",
      "Jeff Getting: This defense to the case was the one that I felt, my client felt, we together felt gave us the best likelihood of success.",
      "Two months later, just before Christmas 2018, Judge Tarnow issued his ruling.",
      "He found the prosecutor was wrong telling jurors that Linda had two cell phones when there was no evidence of that and he also found fault with the defense, saying Getting failed his client by not calling a fire expert. The judge also pointed out that although Kate Fox's trial testimony was incriminating, she did suffer from mental health problems, and that her brother testified she was known to be untruthful. The judge also agreed that if there was an arson, \"significant evidence pointed the finger of suspicion at Mr. Stermer.\"",
      "In December 2018, nearly 12 years after the fire and after spending almost 9 years in prison, Linda Stermer's conviction was overturned and Judge Tarnow set her free.",

      "For nearly nine years, Trevor Stermer and his brothers went on with their lives, believing their father's killer was behind bars. And then, in December 2018, a federal judge set their mother free.",
      "Erin Moriarty: The fact that a judge took a look at the evidence, and didn't feel she had a fair trial, thought she might be innocent, that doesn't change the way you feel?",
      "Cory Pierce: No. I know that she did what she did.",
      "But Linda's daughters, who believed in her innocence, were afraid they could lose her again.",
      "Ashley Gibson: I have no faith in the justice system right now, to be honest with you.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What's the worst thing that could happen?",
      "Brittany Gibson: They'll send her back to prison.",
      "A year later, Michigan's attorney general tried to do just that, by filing an appeal asking to have Linda's conviction reinstated.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Are you scared?",
      "Linda Stermer: I am. I'd be ignorant not to. \u2026 I know what's at stake now. \u2026 I know what the prison system is like.",
      "On Dec. 3, 2019, Linda Stermer, her daughters, and her mother were in Cincinnati, Ohio, to attend a Federal Court of Appeals hearing, where a panel of three judges would hear the case.",
      "Linda's attorney, Wolfgang Mueller, argued that there is no physical evidence proving that his client intentionally set her house on fire. And without an expert to explain that to the jury, Mueller said Linda did not have a fair trial.",
      "Wolf Mueller: I'm a former auto engineer. I'm a science guy and I am offended by the lack of science and what passed for science in this case.",
      "Mueller won. The court denied the state's appeal, but it wasn't over for Linda. The Van Buren County Prosecutor's Office could retry her and that's exactly what happened. The charges against Linda Stermer for the first-degree murder of her husband were reinstated.",
      "Wolf Mueller: Those penalties are life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "Still, through the next nearly five years of pretrial hearings and delays, Linda remained a free woman. And then, on March 27, 2025, Linda was back in court for opening statements, with a legal team that now included criminal defense attorney Ronald Kelly and her own fire expert, Robert Trenkle. The state presented a long list of witnesses, many who repeated what they had said in the first trial.",
      "Todd Stermer's mother, Sandra testified that, in the aftermath of the fire, her daughter-in-law kept changing her story.",
      "SANDRA STERMER (in court): There was three different stories that I heard within two days, about how she got out of the house.",
      "Linda and Todd's son Cory said the same.",
      "CORY PIERCE (in court): The story changed a few different times.",
      "Cody also testified that Linda pressured him and his brothers to lie to the insurance company, about the state of her marriage to Todd Stermer.",
      "CORY PIERCE (in court): You'll need to tell them that there weren't any issues that you've ever seen. That the marriage good and that they were happy together.",
      "Linda's former co-worker Chris Williams told the jury about his affair with Linda \u2014 and said they were together just two days before the fire.",
      "PROSECUTOR (in court) Your relationship ended the Friday before the fire?",
      "CHRIS WILLIAMS: No, no, it didn't end. She was at my house the Friday.",
      "And there was Linda's former friend Kate Fox, who testified that Linda had talked about wanting to kill Todd.",
      "KATE FOX (in court): She talked about shooting him. she talked about running over him with her car.",
      "Former fire investigator, Scott LeRoy testified about the gas can that was found on the Stermer's front lawn. He also said he smelled gasoline on Todd Stermer's clothing, and that based on the size and speed of the fire, he felt that an accelerant, like gasoline, had been used to start the fire.",
      "SCOTT LEROY (in court): That would in \u2014 incl \u2014 lead me to believe that this is an intentionally set fire.",
      "But in cross examination, LeRoy admitted that he had not been able to test for evidence of gasoline in the Stermer living room.",
      "WOLF MUELLER (in court): There was no gasoline found, other than Todd Stermer's sweatpants, in the area of origin, is that correct?",
      "SCOTT LEROY: I was unable to locate any gasoline in the living room, due to the heavy destruction of the living room.",
      "On day seven, the prosecution rested, and the defense team began calling their witnesses, including a close friend who said she had been to the Stermer home and recalled seeing holes in the ceilings, with wires hanging down and no smoke detectors.",
      "CASANDRA GRIGG \u00a0(in court) Nothing was finished in the house. \u2026 you could see some of the instulation (sic) around the windows. \u2026 the fireplace upstairs didn't have any drywall on it, or anything, it was all board.",
      "Then, Linda's own fire expert took the stand. Robert Trenkle told the jury that, in his opinion, there is no way to know how the fire started, because the state investigator, Scott LeRoy, failed to properly excavate and examine the ruins, and did not take proper photographs.",
      "ROBERT TRENKLE (in court): If you don't collect data, you can't analyze it.",
      "Trenkle also wanted to explain why he believes that gasoline had not been used to set Todd Stermer on fire. To demonstrate his theory, Mueller played two videos of an experiment conducted by Trenkle.",
      "First Trenkle attempts to ignite a clean section of material from a pair of polyester sweatpants like the ones Todd Stermer was wearing the day of the fire. Trenkle holds a match to it for quite a while and, eventually, a small patch does catch fire and then quickly burns out.",
      "A second clip shows the same piece of fabric, splashed with two ounces of gasoline, and then set on fire. This time we see huge flames, and the material quickly melts. But that's not what happened to Todd Stermer.",
      "Wolf Mueller: His sweatpants were not burned.",
      "Wolf Mueller: The whole case hinges on, was there an arson? Was there intentionally set fire? \u2026 If the jury does what they're supposed to do and follows the law \u2026 then they'll focus on the arson. No arson, no crime.",
      "But Mueller also had to explain why, when Todd Stermer did finally escape the burning house, his wife hit him with their van?",
      "Wolf Mueller: Remember, this is a 5,000-pound Ford Econoline van. If she'd wanted \u2026 to kill him \u2026 he would've probably had injuries, organ damage. He had none of that. He had lacerations.",
      "After a day-and-a-half of testimony, the defense rested. The next morning, the case went to the jury.",
      "It took seven-and-a-half hours of deliberation, for the jury of six men and six women to reach a verdict. As Linda Stermer prepared to hear her fate, her sons and Todd's mother sat nervously behind the prosecution team.",
      "We the jury find the defendant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder.",
      "Guilty. Linda Stermer was visibly shaken. Trevor, Trenton and Cory, appeared to fight back tears. Their mother, once again convicted of killing their father, would go back to prison.",
      "Trevor Stermer, as he told \"48 Hours\" in 2019, will never get over the loss of his father, Todd Stermer.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How much do you miss your dad?",
      "Trevor Stermer: Every day. Every single day. It kills me that he can't be a part of my children's life anymore, that they \u2014 they don't have that privilege of having a grandfather like him. It's devastating.",

The pouch, which students carry with them, is locked and unlocked using magnets affixed to the entrance of the school and outside the main office.",
      "Gallagher, 16, said she had already started to put limits on her phone use this summer when she found out the pouches would be required at school, and she was \"partially excited,\" but also worried about \"how everyone else was going to take it.\"",
      "She said some students welcomed the idea, but others plotted how to destroy or dismantle the dark gray pouch with bright green lining \u2014 a sentiment heard across several New York districts as the school year started.",
      "Still, a solution to containing cellphones was needed, many educators and parents say.",
      "\"Our children were distracted\" by their cellphones, said Dr. Sandy Hattar, the principal at Yonkers Middle High School and an educator for 20 years. She said students always wanted to know what was going on in the bathrooms, in the next room or across the hall instead of being \"centered in the classroom and learning from what was happening in front of them.\"",
      "Students in 35 states, including New York, Florida, Texas, California,\u00a0Massachusetts and Georgia, now contend with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. At least 2.5 million students across the country are using Yondr pouches, and the company said the number could triple after the 2025 numbers are tallied in about three months.",
      "Experience life outside of a \"fully digital realm\"",
      "Yondr CEO Graham Dugoni said he founded the company in 2014 when he was living in San Francisco and had the idea of creating \"phone-free spaces.\"",
      "Dugoni, who uses a flip phone, said reading philosophers from S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard to Albert Borgmann helped shape his ideas to create spaces where people can be free \"from the constant tug and pull of smartphones,\" and build opportunities for people \"to experience life outside of a fully digital realm.\"",
      "He said a school in San Francisco was their first client and the company now has school partners in all 50 states and 45 different countries. More than 100 people work for the company and several collaborate closely with the schools to ensure not only compliance but also a successful implementation.",
      "Alana Berk was a teacher in Nashville before joining Yondr to help schools from Virginia to Maine integrate the pouches into\u00a0 students' lives. Berk said many schools welcome the change.",
      "The cost of buying the pouches \u2014 roughly $25-30 per student \u2014 has set off debates around how schools should be spending their limited budgets. It's a particular issue for districts struggling with crumbling infrastructure, limited textbooks and access to other technology needed to learn.",
      "Dugoni declined to disclose the company's revenue but said that since the end of the pandemic, they've had triple-digit annual growth. A national database of school spending is not available, but some states and districts made their budgets public. New York's 2024 state budget\u00a0set aside $13.5 million to assist school districts in enforcing the statewide \"bell-to-bell\" cellphone ban.",
      "Yonkers principal Hatter said the pouches cost about $30 and each student is responsible for their Yondr if it's lost or ruined \u2014 \"just like a textbook,\" she said. Districts in various states have reported spending from $26,000 to over $370,000, with Cincinnati Schools saying they spent $500,000 to provide pouches for students in grades 7-12.",
      "From skepticism to anger, students adjust to a new pouch reality",
      "Sariyah Fidelis,17, was skeptical when she first heard the pouches were coming to her school. She wanted to listen to music on her phone and be able to check things in class as she needed. The senior was worried about delays in getting and out of the building and there being chaos at the school.",
      "The students each got a pouch on the first school day to keep for the year. The pouches with their phones are kept with the students, but they need to use one of the school's magnetic openers in order to take their phone out of the pouch. Some students have reported long lines and disruption at their schools as they wait to open their pouches.",
      "But Fidelis said on the first day at Yonkers, the lines went pretty smoothly and she saw quick benefits. Instead of being on her phone the whole lunch period, she spoke to her friend. \"I felt human,\" she said.",
      "\"Our whole perspective is that it's not taking something away from students, it's giving them something back,\" Dugoni told CBS News.",
      "Other students were not so enthralled by the pouch; some reported seeing classmates bypass the Yondr pouch by using their Apple watches, buying \"burner\" phones and putting them in the pouch, breaking the pouch and other tricks to get to their phones.",
      "Dugoni acknowledged that there will always be some students who can figure out how to get around the restrictions. The purpose of the pouches, he said, was to create a culture change in a school and create an environment conducive to their learning and development.",
      "More than 70% of high school teachers in the U.S. say cellphones are a major classroom distraction, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center Center.",
      "Leila Pasqualini, a math teacher at Yonkers for 27 years, was hopeful the new system would work and stay in place. She said she wanted her students to know right from wrong and learn critical thinking \u2014 and that wasn't possible with technology, she said.",
      "Hattar said that although she was initially worried that banning students' phones would be challenging, now she hopes taking phones out of the classrooms will help students engage.",
      "\"Of course, there will be kinks, but we'll iron it out together,\" said Hatter, adding that she already notices a difference.\u00a0 \"There is more talking, it's louder, but it's a positive loud.\"",

    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin this morning with the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good morning and thank you for being here.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Yes I agree with this article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical that we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Other ways to implement tariffs. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- But it might be like, yeah, too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday. But, but yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you, it's great to be here."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

      "Associated Press reporters saw a plume of smoke rising from the roof of Kyiv's cabinet of ministers building, but it was not immediately clear if the smoke was the result of a direct hit or debris, which would mark an escalation in Russia's air campaign, which has so far spared government buildings in the city center.",

      "In July, Ishiba's ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government. The loss added to an earlier election defeat in the lower house, where the party-led coalition also had lost a majority.",

      "A conservative heavyweight, Taro Aso, known for his anti-Ishiba stance, and a minister and several deputy ministers in the Ishiba Cabinet have requested an early vote, prompting others to follow suit.",
      "Former Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told an NHK talk show earlier Sunday that the best way to stop the party divide and move forward is for Ishiba \"to settle\" the dispute before Monday's vote, urging his resignation. The party has already been distracted from necessary work on economic measures and on figuring out ways to gain opposition support in the next parliamentary session, Tamura said.",
      "With Ishiba stepping down as party leader, the LDP is expected to set a date for its party presidential election, likely to be held in early October.",
      "Possible candidates include Koizumi, as well as ultra-conservative former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, a moderate and the protege of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.",
      "Lacking a majority in both houses, the next LDP leader will have to work with the main opposition parties to get bills passed, experts say, or else face constant risks of no-confidence motions.",
      "The opposition parties, however, are too splintered to form a big coalition to topple the government.",
      "In recent weeks, Ishiba successfully got President Trump to lower the tariff rates the U.S. administration imposed on Japan from 25% to 15%. Ishiba also said he has had his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, deliver his letter to Trump, stating his wish to work with him to create \"the golden era\" of the Japan-U.S. alliance, inviting the American leader to visit Japan.",
      "Ishiba's top aide, LDP Secretary General Hiroshi Moriyama, a key figure who negotiated with main opposition leaders to help achieve legislation since the prime minister took office, has also expressed his intention to step down on Sept. 2 over the election loss, though Ishiba hasn't granted him resignation. Moriyama's departure would have dealt a blow to the prime minister.",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Sep 2025 08:22:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Carlo Acutis has generated near rock star-like fame among young Catholics.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of young Catholics flock to the small central Italian town of Assisi every year to pay tribute to Carlo Acutis \u2013 the Italian teenager informally known as \"God's Influencer.\"",
      "The 15-year-old computer whiz became the Catholic Church's first millennial saint on Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith.",
      "Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \"masterpieces\" out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\"The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God's plan,\" Leo said in his homily. The new saints \"are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\"",
      "Who was Carlo Acutis?",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy Italian family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born, and according to reports, he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood that was marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "He launched and managed a website for his local parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world, available in nearly 20 languages. The site provides information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events in the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "\"Carlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\" the late Pope Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \"Yet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\"",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\"This was the fixed appointment of his day,\" his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that is airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. He died in Monza, Italy, within days of his diagnosis. His body was entombed in Assisi and is on full display alongside other relics linked to him.",
      "Fast track to sainthood",
      "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Acutis has generated a near rock star-like fame among young faithful the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn't seen in ages.",
      "Those who can't make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of internet accessibility not afforded even to popes buried in St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Acutis' path to sainthood began more than 10 years ago, initiated by a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis assumed the papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a significant site associated with St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was beatified in 2020 \u2013 the first step to sainthood \u2013 after Acutis was credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "Last year, Francis approved the second miracle needed for Acutis to be made a saint. The second miracle involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "The canonization \u2013 the first for Pope Leo XIV \u2013 was initially scheduled for earlier this year but was postponed following Francis' death in April.",
      "An appeal to the youth",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things: a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\"When I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me, because from a very early age, he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\" Sona Harrison, an eighth grader at the St. John Berchmans' school, which is part of the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago's Northwest Side, told the Associated Press. \"I feel like he's a lot more relatable, and I definitely feel like I'm closer to God when I read about him.\"",
      "During Mass this week before the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have carried: a soccer ball, a laptop and a knapsack.",
      "\"He fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\" said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \"a great man.\" Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games \u2014 and awe at Acutis' restraint.",
      "\"He played video games for like only one hour a week, which I don't think I can do,\" he told the AP.",
      "Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.",
      "\"He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,\" he said in a statement. \"He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.\"",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints' enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.",
      "Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.",

    "summary": "Israel's army has urged Palestinians in Gaza City to move to a designated humanitarian area in the south. Meanwhile, an ailing Palestinian toddler recovers in Italy.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's army called Saturday on Palestinians in Gaza City to move to a humanitarian area it designated in the south as it expanded its operations in preparation for seizing the famine-stricken city.",
      "Parts of the city, home to nearly 1 million people, are already considered \"red zones,\" where evacuation orders have been issued ahead of expected heavy fighting.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned that a large-scale evacuation of Gaza City would exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. Palestinians have been uprooted and displaced multiple times during the nearly two-year-long war, with many being too weak to move and having nowhere to go.",
      "Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in X that the army declared Muwasi \u2014 a makeshift tent camp in southern Gaza Strip \u2014 a humanitarian area and urged everyone in the city, which it called a Hamas stronghold and specified as a combat zone, to leave. The army said they could travel in cars down a designated road without being searched.",
      "The military, in a statement, provided a map showing the area in Khan Younis that the humanitarian area encompasses, which includes the block where Nasser Hospital is located. The area around the hospital has been considered a red zone, though not the medical facility itself. Last week, Israel struck the hospital, killing 22 people, including Mariam Dagga, who worked for The Associated Press and other media outlets. The hospital was not under evacuation.",
      "The designated safe zone would include field hospitals, water pipelines, food and tents, and relief efforts \"will continue on an ongoing basis in cooperation with the U.N. and international organizations,\" the statement said. The United Nations couldn't be immediately reached for comment.",
      "Israeli forces have struck humanitarian areas throughout the war, including Muwasi, which they previously declared a safe zone, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "The evacuation order came a day after Israel struck a high-rise building in Gaza City, saying Hamas used it for surveillance, without providing evidence.",
      "The war started after Hamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in their attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with many released through ceasefires or other agreements. Israel believes about 20 are still alive, though the bodies of two hostages were recovered during a joint operation in late August.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up around half the dead. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "Israel says the war will continue until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed, and that it will retain open-ended security control of the territory of some 2 million Palestinians. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "\"Lack of food, treatment and possibilities\"",
      "Shamm Qudeih, a toddler who was photographed by Dagga and evacuated to Italy for treatment for severe malnutrition and a genetic metabolic disease, celebrated her second birthday in an Italian hospital this week. She was evacuated with her mother and 10-year-old sister. The Italian Foreign Ministry says 181 Palestinian children are being treated in Italy.",
      "A photo of Shamm in her mother's arms in Gaza went viral for the child's thin limbs, visible ribs and distressed face. Shamm weighed about nine pounds when she arrived at the Santobono Pausilipon Children's Hospital in Naples.",
      "The toddler was \"in a serious and challenging clinical state,\" said Dr. Daniele de Brasi, a pediatric genetic disease specialist who is treating Shamm. De Brasi said \"a big part\" of her undernourishment was due to a genetic metabolic disease called glycogen storage disease, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients, particularly carbohydrates, and can cause muscle weakness and impede growth. The condition is primarily managed through a high-carbohydrate diet.",
      "Shamm's mother, Islam Qudeih, said that the family has moved more than a dozen times since the start of the war in Gaza. It has been a struggle to get proper medical care, she said. Doctors suspected Shamm had the rare condition, but could not test for it or treat it properly. Qudeih said her daughter's condition \"became worse as a result of the lack of food, treatment and possibilities.\"",
      "Shamm now weighs just over 12 pounds, which is still no more than half of the median weight for a child her age, de Brasi said. Her current caloric intake is about 500 calories a day, which doctors are gradually increasing. A cornerstone of her diet is a carbohydrate-rich porridge. At night, a feeding tube ensures she gets the right mix of nutrients while she sleeps. Doctors hope to remove the tube in about a month.",
      "Shamm's sister Judi has also been treated by doctors after they noticed she was underweight, de Brasi said. Judi has gained about five pounds and is in condition. Qudeih said that she is allowing herself to experience relief as her daughters improve, but she can't imagine going back to Gaza, where Shamm's father remains.",
      "\"Now there is no way to go back, as long as the war is going on. There are no possibilities for my daughters,\" Qudeih said.",

      "The Universal Postal Union says it has started rolling out new measures that can help postal operators around the world calculate and collect duties, or taxes, after the U.S. eliminated the so-called \"de minimis exemption\" for lower-value parcels.",
      "Eighty-eight postal operators have told the UPU that they have suspended some or all postal services to the United States until a solution is implemented with regard to U.S.-bound parcels valued at $800 or less, which had been the cutoff for imported goods to escape customs charges.",
      "\"The global network saw postal traffic to the U.S. come to a near-halt after the implementation of the new rules on Aug. 29, 2025, which for the first time placed the burden of customs duty collection and remittance on transportation carriers or U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency-approved qualified parties,\" the UPU said in a statement.",
      "The UPU said information exchanged between postal operators through its electronic network showed traffic from its 192 member countries \u2014 nearly all the world's countries \u2014 had fallen 81% on Aug. 29, compared to a week earlier.",
      "The Bern, Switzerland-based agency said the \"major operational disruptions\" have occurred because airlines and other carriers indicated they weren't willing or able to collect such duties, and foreign postal operators had not established a link to CBP-qualified companies.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has skyrocketed over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to about 1.4 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was processing more than 4 million \"de minimis\" shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.",
      "Before the measure took effect, the postal union sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to express concerns about its impact.",
      "The de minimis provision was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law was passed. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs now require vetting and are subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome on Saturday, celebrating a new level of acceptance in the Catholic Church after long feeling shunned and crediting Pope Francis with the change.",
      "The vice president of the Italian bishops conference, Bishop Franceseco Savino, celebrated Mass for the pilgrims in a packed Chiesa del Gesu, the main Jesuit church in Rome. He received a sustained standing ovation in the middle of his homily when he recalled that Jubilee celebrations historically were meant to restore hope to those on the margins.",
      "\"The Jubilee was the time to free the oppressed and restore dignity to those who had been denied it,\" he said. \"Brothers and sisters, I say this with emotion: It is time to restore dignity to everyone, especially to those who have been denied it.\"",
      "Several LGBTQ+ groups participated in the pilgrimage, which was listed in the Vatican's official calendar of events for the Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. Vatican organizers stressed that the listing in the calendar didn't signal endorsement or sponsorship.",
      "The main organizer of the pilgrimage was an Italian LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, \"Jonathan's Tent,\" but other groups participated, including DignityUSA and Outreach, another U.S. group.",
      "\"I was here 25 years ago at the last Holy Year with a contingent of LGBTQ people from the U.S. and we were actually detained as a threat to the Holy Year programs,\" said DignityUSA's Marianne Duddy Burke.",
      "To now be invited to walk through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica \"fully recognized as who we are and the gifts we bring to the church, and that we have both our faith and our identities combined, is a day of great celebration and hope,\" she said.",
      "A 2020 study\u00a0from UCLA's Williams Institute discovered that there were about 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the U.S., and about 5.3 million of them are religious, including about 1.3 million who are Roman Catholics.",
      "Pope Leo XIV celebrated a special Jubilee audience Saturday at the Vatican for all pilgrim groups in Rome this weekend, but made no special mention of the LGBTQ+ Catholics.",
      "A legacy of LGBTQ+ acceptance",
      "Many of the pilgrims attributed their feeling of welcome to Francis. More than any of his predecessors, Francis distinguished himself with a message of welcome. Four months after Francis became pope in 2013, he sparked controversy when, during a July in-flight press conference, he responded to a journalist's question about gay clergy members, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Francis' answer went against years of Catholic precedent.",
      "His words\u00a0set a very different tone\u00a0from the previous relationship the Church had with gay clergy and members. His predecessors \u2014 John Paul II and Benedict XVI \u2014 were far less accepting of LGBTQ people. In 1986, Benedict XVI published the first\u00a0modern formal statement\u00a0denouncing homosexuality.",
      "He never changed church teaching, saying homosexual acts are \"intrinsically disordered.\" But during his 12-year papacy from 2013 to 2025, Francis met with LGBTQ advocates, ministered to a community of trans women and, in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, declared that \"being homosexual is not a crime.\"",
      "Francis, who died at 88 earlier this year, didn't change doctrine, but he altered the conversation by voicing support for legal civil unions, personally meeting with LGBTQ groups and extending\u00a0blessings to individuals in same-sex unions.",
      "John Capozzi of Washington, D.C., who was participating in the pilgrimage with his husband, Justin del Rosario, said Francis' attitude brought him back to the church after he left it in the 1980s, at the height of the AIDS crisis. Then, he said, he felt shunned by his fellow Catholics.",
      "\"There was that feeling like I wasn't welcome in the church,\" he said. \"Not because I was doing anything, just because I was who I was,\" he said. \"It was this fear of going back in because of the judgment.\"",
      "But Francis, who insisted that the Catholic Church was open to everyone, \"todos, todos, todos,\" changed all that, he said.",
      "\"I was a closeted Catholic,\" Capozzi said. \"With Pope Francis, I was able to come out and say, 'Hey, you know, I am Catholic and I'm proud of it and I want to be part of the church.\"",
      "\"Tears of hope\"",
      "Capozzi spoke during a standing room-only vigil service for the pilgrims on Friday night at the Jesuit church. The service featured testimonies from gay couples, the mother of a trans child and a moving reflection by an Italian priest, the Rev. Fausto Focosi.",
      "\"Our eyes have known the tears of rejection, of hiding. They have known the tears of shame. And perhaps sometimes those tears still spring from our eyes,\" Focosi said. \"Today, however, there are other tears, new tears. They wash away the old ones.\"",
      "\"And so today these tears are tears of hope,\" he said.",
      "Leo's position becomes more clear",
      "Leo's position on LGBTQ+ Catholics had been\u00a0something of a question. Soon after he was elected in May, remarks surfaced from 2012 in which the future pope, then known as the Rev. Robert Prevost, criticized the \"homosexual lifestyle\" and the role of mass media in promoting acceptance of same-sex relationships that conflicted with Catholic doctrine.",
      "When he became a cardinal in 2023, Catholic News Service asked Prevost if his views had changed. He\u00a0acknowledged Francis' call\u00a0for a more inclusive church, saying Francis \"made it very clear that he doesn't want people to be excluded simply on the basis of choices that they make, whether it be lifestyle, work, way to dress, or whatever.\"",
      "Leo\u00a0met on Monday with the Rev. James Martin, an American Jesuit who has advocated for a greater welcome for LGBTQ+ Catholics. Martin emerged, saying Leo told him he intended to continue Francis' policy of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the church and encouraged him to keep up his advocacy.",
      "\"I heard the same message from Pope Leo that I heard from Pope Francis, which is the desire to welcome all people, including LGBTQ people,\" Martin told The Associated Press after the audience.",
      "Savino said he, too, had received Leo's blessing to celebrate the Mass for the LGBTQ+ pilgrims.",
      "Del Rosario, Capozzi's husband, said he now felt welcome after long staying away from the faith he was raised in.",

      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",

He doesn't love us or value us anymore or less depending on how we look. He's a God of the heart that judges the heart, and it's all about who we are on the inside. And that is where I will continually go back to. No matter how the culture changes in terms of diet and what fad and what body type is in, I know that God loves me for who I am and my heart and doesn't pay attention to the exterior and places no value in it whatsoever.\"",

The United Kingdom once had separate War and Air ministries, which were merged after World War II into today\u2019s Ministry of Defence. In Germany, pre-1945 governments relied on a War Ministry, but postwar leaders created a Federal Ministry of Defense to emphasize collective security within NATO. Russia maintains a Ministry of Defense, headquartered in Moscow, even as it wages wars abroad.",

      "Before the recess, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., teamed up to potentially bypass Johnson and compel the House to vote on releasing the Epstein files. The Epstein milieu quickly infected virtually every single legislative effort in Congress, effectively hamstringing the body. So, Johnson cut everyone loose a bit early.",

But Johnson designed the measure in a way that the House could approve it \u2013 without taking a direct vote on it. That way, Republicans could point to angry constituents that they were in fact taking the Epstein files seriously \u2013 without an actual roll call vote documenting their position and perhaps infuriating President Donald Trump. Or they could tell other constituents who wouldn\u2019t want them to cross the president on Epstein to say they never directly voted on it at all. After all, it was buried in an unrelated measure.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",

      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

Apps like Proofr and Ravin give you the same technology, but on your side. By scanning your car before and after your rental, you create a digital record that can help you challenge unfair claims.",

      "Inside the viral AI engagement story",
      "A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she's engaged to her AI chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.",
      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time, their conversations grew more personal, and Wika says she developed a genuine emotional connection. According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",

      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Who owns National Public Data now?",
      "NPD has relaunched under Perfect Privacy LLC, a company that sounds protective but is not affiliated with the VPN service of the same name.

      "NPD offers an opt-out function for users who prefer not to have their information available on the site. (NPD)",
      "Why NPD is only part of the problem",
      "Removing your information from National Public Data is only the beginning. Dozens of other people search sites may still display your personal details. Many of these platforms pull from the same public databases, which means your address, phone number or relatives' names can keep reappearing.",
      "The return of NPD shows how quickly data can resurface online. A breach may fade from the headlines, but the exposed information rarely disappears. To protect your privacy, you need a broader plan.",
      "Start by searching for your name on people search engines several times a year. Look beyond NPD. Sites like Whitepages, Spokeo and Radaris often host similar data. Regular checks help you spot new profiles before they spread further.",
      "STOP DATA BROKERS FROM SELLING YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE",
      "A removal service can save time by scanning hundreds of databases at once. These services request opt-outs on your behalf and track new listings. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Protecting your privacy goes beyond deleting profiles. Keep an eye on your bank statements, credit reports and online accounts. Criminals can use exposed data for phishing attempts, fake loan applications or identity theft. Monitoring activity gives you an early warning if something looks suspicious.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, which could potentially access your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "4) Set up alerts for your identity",
      "Many banks and credit monitoring services let you create alerts for suspicious activity. You can also set up free fraud alerts with the credit bureaus. These warnings tell lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before issuing new credit.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "People search sites often pull records from government databases. Review your local county's property, court or voter registration records. Some jurisdictions allow you to request redactions or limit what is shown online.",
      "Since NPD and similar sites scrape from social media, tighten your privacy settings. Limit what strangers can see on Facebook, LinkedIn and other platforms. The less public information you share, the less these databases can collect.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The return of National Public Data is a reminder that your personal information can resurface at any time. Even if you remove yourself from one site, dozens more may still hold your details. That is why protecting your privacy requires more than a quick opt-out. With regular checks, credit freezes and stronger account monitoring, you can reduce your risk and stay one step ahead.",

      "\"He eventually realized he couldn't control the bleeding and made his way back to the engine,\" Kleiman recalls.\u00a0\"The crew noted that he was pale and sweaty and that his turnout gear was saturated in blood. Traditional methods failed, so they administered TRAUMAGEL. It instantly stopped the bleeding.\"",

      "Home Wi-Fi networks are the backbone of how most people get online, connecting laptops, phones, smart TVs and more. When properly secured, they offer a convenient and private way to browse the internet, stream content and work from home. But \"private\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" Wi-Fi security can be easily compromised if you have weak settings or outdated equipment.",

      "Her question points to a bigger concern. Many of us rely on home networks every day without really knowing if they're as secure as they should be.",

      "A user troubleshoots an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

      "The Navy flew a drone nonstop for over three days to test new long-endurance solar-powered autonomous aircraft technology. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy solar drone proves nonstop endurance",
      "The three-day nonstop flight proved that solar-powered drones can store enough energy during daylight to keep flying through the night. Engineers confirmed that Skydweller not only stayed airborne but also handled real-time autonomous decisions, adapted to turbulent weather and maintained secure communications.",
      "AI DRONE FINDS MISSING HIKER'S REMAINS IN MOUNTAINS AFTER 10 MONTHS",
      "Officials say the drone's wingspan matches that of a Boeing 747, yet it weighs about as much as a Ford F-150. With solar panels covering its massive wings, Skydweller powers four electric propeller engines during the day while storing extra energy in batteries for night flights.",
      "The Navy, in partnership with Skydweller Aero, recently achieved continuous solar-powered unmanned flight during a nonstop three-day test. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy expands solar-powered surveillance",
      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",

      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible. If solar power can keep an aircraft in the air for days, similar advances may eventually reach consumer tech, disaster relief and even commercial aviation.

This milestone also points to practical uses beyond defense, from disaster response to global communications. As testing continues, the focus will shift from what is possible to how long these systems can stay airborne and how widely they can be deployed.

      "It's tempting to post a \"Goodbye, old house!\" photo online, but resist the urge. Publicly announcing a move tells scammers exactly when your home is empty and what your new address might be. Instead, share the news directly with family and close friends. A little less buzz online means a lot more safety offline.",
      "One powerful way to stay ahead of scammers is to freeze your credit. A freeze blocks new credit accounts from being opened in your name, even if criminals have your address or other details. The good news is that you can do this for free with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "It only takes a few minutes online or by phone, and you can lift the freeze anytime if you need to apply for a loan or credit card. By freezing your credit before and after your move, you create a strong barrier that keeps thieves from turning stolen data into financial damage.",

      "'CyberGuy' Kurt Knutsson shares his tips on reducing daily internet usage after an eye-opening poll reveals Americans spend nearly half their day online on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Self-driving trucks are moving closer to reality. PlusAI released its first half 2025 performance results, showing how far the company has come toward its goal of launching factory-built autonomous trucks in 2027.",
      "The numbers are clear. Safety case readiness reached 86%, with a goal of 100% by launch. Autonomous miles percentage climbed to 98%. Remote assistance free trips rose to 76%, with a target of more than 90%.",

      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",

      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",

      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently.

      "Danny Citrinowicz, a senior fellow at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, said Hezbollah\u2019s reach depends heavily on the region\u2019s Lebanese diaspora. \"Most of the Shia diaspora, at least in Central and South America, is Lebanese,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Hezbollah is the connector between the diaspora and Iran.\"",
      "Citrinowicz said the group uses family ties, language and community institutions to cement its influence across Latin America. \"They appoint imams, fund religious centers and control educational programs\u2026 through these networks, Hezbollah can interact with local cartels, sell drugs and channel the profits back to Lebanon through elaborate schemes.\"",
      "He said this role as a connector makes Hezbollah indispensable to\u00a0Iran\u2019s strategy in the Western Hemisphere. \"The connection starts and ends with enmity towards the West in general, specifically to the United States,\" he said. \"As long as Maduro is there, the Iranians will be there.

Maduro doesn\u2019t care \u2014 he and his friends benefit financially.\"",
      "Both experts pointed to state complicity as the key enabler. \"Under Maduro and Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has become a major transshipment hub for Colombian cocaine,\" Townsend said. \"There have been several indictments in the U.S. and Treasury OFAC designations that tie senior government officials directly to the use of state infrastructure \u2014 ports, air bases, even military convoys \u2014 to move massive shipments of cocaine.

      "Citrinowicz emphasized Iran\u2019s investment in Venezuelan power structures. \"The enhancement is illustrated by several aspects: first and foremost, the military cooperation, especially Iranian factories building UAVs for the Venezuelan army, and constant Quds Force flights from Iran through Africa toward Venezuela,\" he said. \"Iran is also teaching Venezuela how to bypass sanctions and has invested billions into the economy.\"",
      "Experts say Washington\u2019s best leverage lies in choking the finances. \"We need to aggressively target and choke these financial networks,\" Townsend said. \"The priority is to attack the financial and logistical networks, indict everyone we can and pressure Maduro. If we can cut off the financial arteries, the cocaine won\u2019t be as profitable.\"",
      "Citrinowicz agreed that the strike fits into a broader effort. \"By weakening Maduro, the U.S. weakens the Iranian presence in\u00a0Latin America and weakens Iran\u2019s ability to threaten U.S. soil,\" he said. \"The best way to weaken Venezuela is also to aim against the Iranian presence over there.\"",

      "Berlin swing musician David Hermlin says he is facing cancellation after being excluded from some of Europe\u2019s leading jazz festivals and accused of intimidation at a meeting organized by a pro-Palestinian group.\u00a0The 25-year-old told Fox News Digital that his only actions were asking two questions and wearing a yellow pin in solidarity with hostages still held in Gaza.\"I didn\u2019t harass or intimidate anyone. I merely asked two questions I thought were legitimate,\" Hermlin said.",
      "Known on social media as \"Daveetheewave,\" Hermlin has built a reputation not just for his music but for his image. He dresses in authentic 1930s fashion, complete with slicked-back hair, vintage microphone, and a charcoal gray suit that looks plucked from a Fred Astaire film.BBC DEEMED UK PUNK-RAP DUO 'HIGH RISK' BEFORE CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-ISRAEL PERFORMANCE",

He sings classics like \"Let\u2019s Fall in Love\" backed by his own big band, The Swing Dance Orchestra, that re-creates the golden era of swing down to the last detail. His yellow ribbon pin, worn neatly on the lapel of that tailored suit, stood out at this year\u2019s festival and became a flashpoint in the controversy.",
      "Hermlin\u2019s experience raises questions about free speech in the entertainment world. He frames his case as part of a broader historical pattern of exclusion.\"What kind of a world is this now that before I can play at a festival, I have to make a political statement? It\u2019s a music festival, not a political festival,\" he said.ANTI-ISRAEL BAND PLAYS VICTIM AFTER BEING HAMMERED FOR SAYING \u2018DEATH TO THE IDF\u2019 DURING MUSIC FESTIVAL",

      "The Herr\u00e4ng Dance Camp in Sweden is considered one of the world\u2019s most recognized swing festivals. At this year\u2019s gathering, a group called Jazz with Palestine held an open meeting. Hermlin was performing as a drummer with another ensemble, not his own orchestra.\u00a0He later learned that organizers not only excluded him from that group\u2019s jam sessions but also made it clear they would not consider booking his personal projects, like The Swing Dance Orchestra.\"I went with the sole intention to just listen to their concerns and if possible have a dialogue,\" Hermlin explained.",
      "At the Jazz with Palestine meeting, Hermlin asked two questions. He wanted to know where monetary donations would be directed, and what the lyrics of the Arabic song used for choreography meant. The exchange later prompted complaints about his \"intimidating presence.\"\"The first question was, if I want to donate some money, where are the donations going?\" Hermlin recalled. \"The second was, what\u2019s the meaning of the Arabic song? They said they didn\u2019t know. I asked, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to know before filming a choreography?\"STATE DEPARTMENT PULLS VISAS FOR BRITISH BAND BOB VYLAN, FOLLOWING \u2018DEATH TO THE IDF\u2019 CHANTS AT GLASTONBURY",

      "He said he was stunned when a board member told him some attendees were uncomfortable.",
      "Hermlin also faced criticism for wearing the small yellow lapel pin, which symbolizes solidarity with the 50 hostages still held by Hamas. Festivalgoers suggested the pin was inflammatory or political propaganda. Hermlin rejects that characterization.\"People pointed at my yellow pin and said, maybe people are aggressive because of your pin. I asked them, do you know what it means? They said no,\" he said. \"This pin is about the hostages. It\u2019s not about the IDF or the government. It\u2019s about empathy.\"",
      "After Herr\u00e4ng, Hermlin said other festivals began dropping him from their lineups while keeping his band. \"I\u2019m the only one being excluded. Not the band, just me,\" he said. \"A festival told me, don\u2019t take it personally, you\u2019ll get a cancellation fee. But how is that not personal?\"",

On its website and social media, the group describes itself as a movement of jazz and swing dancers across Europe who use music, dance, and political action to stand with the Palestinian people.\u00a0Its mission statement says the group raises awareness and funds and that jazz is rooted in the \"fight against racial and colonial oppression.\" The group has recently promoted fundraising efforts for humanitarian groups in Gaza and announced plans for social dance events and educational forums.",
      "Hermlin says the treatment reminds him of both the McCarthy era and his own family\u2019s history in Berlin during the 1930s. He also points to the swing world\u2019s history of exclusion.\u00a0\"It reminds me of the McCarthy era, when artists were pressed to declare if they were communists. If you said yes, you were boycotted,\" he said. \"They did this in front of photos of Norma Miller, Frankie Manning, and the Nicholas Brothers, artists excluded in the 1930s. How ironic is that?\"",
      "He also cites Benny Goodman, the Jewish clarinetist who became the \"King of Swing\" and defied segregation by hiring Black musicians such as Teddy Wilson, Lionel Hampton, and Charlie Christian. \"As Benny Goodman showed in the 1930s, swing is about inclusion.

      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "\"The idea that\u00a0Hamas didn\u2019t seize aid is absurd,\" Orbach said. \"In every conflict, armed groups take the bulk of humanitarian supplies. We have documents and testimonies proving Hamas did so.\"",
      "The report argues that genocide allegations spread through what Orbach called an \"inverted funnel of information.\" Journalists and aid workers in Gaza often depended on Hamas-linked translators and fixers, whose accounts filtered into U.N. reports, mainstream media and online platforms.",
      "\"The average Westerner sees dozens of reports about Israeli crimes and assumes they must be true. But they all trace back to a handful of Hamas-affiliated sources,\" Orbach said.",
      "Israeli air strikes on Gaza a day after Hamas terrorists invaded parts of southern Israel. Oct 2023. (Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)",

      "The study pays particular attention to casualty figures published by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, claiming they were manipulated to create misleading impressions of the demographics of the dead.

      "The report says that genocide requires systematic intent to destroy a people \u2014 something it finds absent in Gaza. \"You don\u2019t see the hallmarks of genocidal warfare here,\" Orbach said. \"There are no campaigns of rape, frontal massacres or close-range executions. In other conflicts in\u00a0the Middle East, dozens of such atrocities occurred in just a few hours of fighting.\"",

      "During a Sept. 7 appearance on Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, Stallone recalled the abuse he faced by his father as a kid and how it ultimately made him want to be an actor.",
      "\"There\u2019s this incredible sense of emptiness because why couldn\u2019t it have been like, a pleasant upbringing? Why did it have to be so dark?\" he said. \"But would I have been here if it was a pleasant \u2014 hell, like, 'The Waltons'? It wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Having a tumultuous relationship with his father, he started to look for \"a real male role model\" elsewhere, he said. That's when his love for acting and performance began.",
      "\"And I couldn\u2019t find it. It certainly wasn\u2019t around the house,\" he said. \"And it wasn\u2019t until I went to the movie theater, but I was never into, like, real serious actors. I was into escapism.\"",
      "The \"Tulsa King\" star ended up dropping out of the University of Miami to pursue acting in New York City. At 23, he moved to the Big Apple to hopefully get some roles, but he was typecast in smaller parts.",
      "That was when Stallone decided to take his career into his own hands. The \"Creed\" star sat down and wrote the highly acclaimed movie \"Rocky.\" The film starred Stallone as a small-time Philadelphia boxer who gets the chance to take on the world heavyweight champion.",
      "Though the film saw much success, Stallone says that studios didn't want him to star in it because they wanted an established actor to take the lead role. Stallone famously insisted he could do the job and turned down an offer of $360,000 to not be in the movie.",
      "While speaking with Willie, he remembered what he told himself years ago when he was first presented with the offer.",
      "\u201c'This is basically you, Sly. If you get rid of this, yes, you\u2019ll have $360 grand,' which was worth a lot more back then, 'but that will go. Eventually, that will be gone, and you\u2019ll be the most bitter human being, because the entire thing was not about selling out,'\" he said.",
      "\"It was about integrity. And I said, if I let this go, I\u2019m letting my life go \u2018cause I\u2019m never going to find this again, never,\" he added.",
      "Stallone's decision to not give up the role proved inspirational for other actors. Willie said Matt Damon once told him that he and Ben Affleck insisted on playing the lead roles in \"Good Will Hunting,\" a movie they wrote together, because of Stallone.",
      "\"Thank you. Thank you, guys,\" Stallone said after hearing that.",
      "Since \"Rocky,\" Stallone has gone on to appear in films like \"Rambo\" and \"The Expendables.\"",
      "Now, the three-time Academy Award nominee will be honored in December at the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors.",
      "\"Does it get you thinking about legacy?\" Willie asked the star.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think a lot of artists dwell on what they\u2019ve done,\" Stallone said. \"It\u2019s like what\u2019s next? What\u2019s next? I want to be relevant. I want to be loved. I need something else.\""

      "During a Sept. 3 interview with British GQ, Bailey reflected on the most recent years of his career, noting, \u201cI\u2019ve been working solidly for about three years now, which has been amazing and mind-blowing.\u201d",
      "However, the actor shared that there was a change of pace on the horizon, adding, \u201cBut with everything happening in the world right now, I\u2019m going to stop acting for a bit next year and just focus on the Shameless Fund.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the next few months, I\u2019ll be focusing on staffing and making sure we get all the right people in all the right places,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this statistic: out of every \u00a3100 raised in the UK, only 1p goes to the LGBTQ+ community. You really have to dig to find solutions, and I genuinely think The Shameless Fund is exactly that.\u201d",

      "Since the premiere of \u201cBridgerton\u201d in December 2020, Bailey has kept busy with projects, including a return to the stage on the West End in 2022. He also starred opposite Matt Bomer in the Showtime series \u201cFellow Travelers,\u201d which earned them both Emmy nominations in 2024.",
      "Bailey has appeared on the silver screen, too, including portraying Fiyero in \u201cWicked\u201d and its upcoming sequel, as well as a role in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d where he formed a tight-knit friendship with his co-star, Scarlett Johansson.",
      "While promoting \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d Bailey shared his thoughts on \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d which premieres on Nov. 21, during an August interview with E! News, calling it \u201creally extraordinary.\u201d",

      "\"I am shocked, horrified, dismayed and disgusted by all the nasty comments about the Princess of Wales today. A woman\u2019s hair is very personal to her, it\u2019s armour, defence, confidence and so much more,\" McKnight wrote in a message he posted the same day on Instagram.",
      "\u201cI cannot believe how evil and lacking in any kind of empathy are the comments, the majority made apparently by other women, attacking a vulnerable other young woman, who has no choice, by dint of who she married, and the role she took on, to bravely face the public,\" he continued.",
      "McKnight went on to reference Kate\u2019s 2024 cancer diagnosis in his message, saying he believed the mom of three would prefer to \"be away from the public arena.\"",
      "\"She has brilliantly and quietly, unselfishly represented our country, the soft power we still have as a nation,\" he wrote, adding, \"Cancer affects individuals differently, but is life-changing for everyone. So FFS LEAVE HER ALONE. SHAME ON YOU.\"",
      "Kate announced in March 2024 that she had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer.  She later shared in January 2025 that she was in remission.",
      "The debut of Kate's new longer blond hair comes two months after she visited patients at a hospital in Essex, England, on July 2. While at the hospital, Kate spoke candidly to patients about her cancer journey.",
      "\u201cYou put on a sort of brave face (with) stoicism through treatment. (When) treatment\u2019s done, then it\u2019s like, \u2018I can crack on, get back to normal again,\u2019\u201d she said, according to video footage from the BBC.",
      "\u201cBut,\" she added, \"actually the phase afterwards is really difficult, you\u2019re not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you\u2019re not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to.\"",
      "Cancer, she told the patients, can be hard on the patient and also his or her loved ones. \"Through first diagnosis or post treatment and things like that, it is a life-changing experience both for the patient but also for the families as well,\" said Kate.",
      "\u201cYou have to find your new normal and that takes time,\" she said, adding, \"and it\u2019s a rollercoaster. It\u2019s not one smooth plane, which you expect it to be. But the reality is it\u2019s not, you go through hard times.\""

      "Wanting to help her editor-in-chief prepare his acceptance speech, Mare ushers him away from the ceremony where they stumble upon a wedding reception. Ned practices his speech as they hit the dance floor, but when the bride and groom kick them out for crashing, they lose hotel access and are locked out. As luck would have it, Ned is nowhere in sight when the Ohio Journalism Awards announce his win for outstanding print coverage.",
      "Seizing the opportunity, Ken and Esmeralda accept on his behalf. Though, no one can understand them because they spend the whole time talking over each other. Before Ken and Esmeralda can get into a fight over the award, Ned arrives and starts delivering a heartfelt speech \u2014 that is, until Esmeralda \u201cfaints.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s fine. In fact, the documentary crew catches her smiling as everyone rushes to her side.",
      "At the end of the night, Oscar shares relationship advice with Ned that makes him reconsider telling Mare how he really feels. Soon after, Ned rushes to Mare\u2019s door and hands her the speech he wrote. Mare says it\u2019s not a good time, leading Ned to assume she's still with Theo. However, she reveals it\u2019s because Nicole is crying in her hotel room over her breakup with Detrick.",
      "In the end, Ned and Mare\u2019s journalistic integrity kicks in and they decide they must kiss for research purposes, hoping if they \u201cget it out of the way,\u201d they could go back to being friends. But if Ned\u2019s \u201coh, s---\u201d response tells us anything, it\u2019s that there is a lot more to unpack come Season 2.",
      "Frei, who plays Mare, tells TODAY.com her and Gleeson\u2019s final scene could have ended without any lip action.",
      "\u201cBecause Donald\u2019s character is so by the book and wants to be a good boss, we filmed it a million different ways. They kiss. They didn\u2019t kiss. They get into a fight,\u201d she says of the different approaches. \u201cSo it was really cool to see that (the directors) ended up choosing the kiss.\u201d",
      "For Frei, Chelsea's budding romance with Ned reminded her of another relationship in her life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because my parents met on a construction site,\u201d Frei says. \u201cMy dad was the boss, and my mom was the secretary. I know it\u2019s ridiculous, but they\u2019re still together over 30 years later. So, what are you going to do? It works.\u201d",
      "Fans will get to see in Season 2 of \u201cThe Paper\u201d if Ned and Mare\u2019s relationship has what it takes to follow suit."

      "Kuleba, whose organization says it has rescued more than 750 children from Russia and Ukrainian territories occupied by its forces, says the push for their removal and re-education came from the highest levels of the Kremlin.",
      "The International Criminal Court has accused Putin of the war crime of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia, and in March 2023 it issued a warrant for his arrest. The ICC has also accused Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Putin\u2019s presidential commissioner for children\u2019s rights, of committing similar crimes.",

      "\u201cThey tried to break me in every possible way,\u201d he said, adding that he was treated \u201cvery badly\u201d and denied food in the first camp because he \u201cbegan to show my pro-Ukrainian position.\u201d",
      "On one occasion, he said, he \u201ctook down the Russian flag and hung my underwear there.\u201d This led to him being thrown into solitary confinement for a week, he said, adding that his captors \u201cfed me twice a day, did not allow me to communicate with anyone at all.\u201d",
      "Another time, he said, the head of security at one of the camps tore a girl\u2019s T-shirt and trampled on it because it bore Ukraine\u2019s coat of arms.",

      "\u201cI understood that Russia is an aggressor country and it took away my childhood and severed my contacts with my family so that I would not see them,\u201d he said.",
      "On the morning of his capture, Vlad said, he had managed to call his mother, Tatiana, 38, to tell her that he had been kidnapped.",
      "Tatiana said she wasn\u2019t home when he was taken because she had been taken to the Russian commandant\u2019s office to write a statement about her mother, Rudenko Tamara, 53, who died in an attack the previous day. They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",
      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",

NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reached out to the FSB for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t all come from the same place. They don\u2019t all go to the same place. They don\u2019t all have the same purpose,\u201d Raymond said in a telephone interview last month.",
      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 11:13:41 GMT",
    "summary": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party deputy Angela Rayner resigned Friday after admitting underpaying property taxes.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Somehow, it keeps getting worse for Keir Starmer.",
      "The British Prime Minister was already in the mire: His economy is barely growing, ascendant critics assail him from the left and right, and his popularity has tanked to historic levels just a year after a landslide victory.",
      "And on Friday Starmer suffered perhaps his most significant setback yet when his influential deputy resigned after admitting she underpaid 40,000 pounds (around $54,000) in property taxes.",
      "Angela Rayner, 45, has not always agreed with Starmer but has been a key figure in his Labour Party, seen as a counterweight voice for its disgruntled left-wing against their leader's centrist conservatism.",
      "After months of press speculation, Rayner admitted this week that she failed to pay enough property taxes \u2014 known as \u201cstamp duty.\u201d She said she believed she had followed the rules, and was tripped up by her \u201ccomplex living arrangements,\u201d including her 2023 divorce and son with special educational needs.",
      "All this played out while she served as the government\u2019s housing secretary as well as its deputy leader.",
      "She referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, who acts as a watchdog appointed by the prime minister. Rayner promptly resigned her role as deputy prime minister and housing minister after his report was delivered Friday.",
      "\"I take full responsibility for this error,\" she said in a letter to Starmer, accepting she \"did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.\"",
      "She said that while \"it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount,\" she \"must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family.\"",
      "Magnus' report agreed that Rayner had acted \"in good faith,\" believing that she was paying the correct amount of tax during the purchase of her 800,000 pound seaside apartment in Hove, on the south coast of England, in May. However he said that Rayner broke the Ministerial Code (a set of rules and standards for people in the government to follow) because she did not follow her solicitors' advice to seek specific tax guidance.",
      "Had she done so, Magnus said, she would have known the correct amount was 70,000 pounds rather than the 30,000 she paid.",
      "\"I believe Ms. Rayner has acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service,\" he said.  But he faulted her \"unfortunate failure\" to pay her taxes correctly, particularly given she was minister for housing at the time.",
      "Tax experts say Rayner will likely now face a fine of up to 12,000 pounds from His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, Britain\u2019s tax authority.",
      "Starmer under pressure",
      "In a handwritten note, Starmer said he was \"very sad\" that Rayner's tenure had \"ended in this way,\" but said it was \"right\" that she had acted on the conclusion of her ethics report despite knowing it was \"very painful\" for her.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, reacted to her resignation by accusing Starmer of having \"no principle, no backbone\" and saying that \"questions remain\" about what he knew, and when.",
      "Just 14 months ago, Starmer won a historic landslide victory against a Conservative Party whose 14-year rule had ended in scandal and widespread public disdain. But polls suggested that his victory owed as much to his opponent\u2019s toxic image as any ringing enthusiasm for his own platform.",
      "Whereas his predecessor as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had sought to take Labour back to its leftist roots, Starmer was more in the mold of Tony Blair: relatively progressive social values mixed with economic conservatism that critics say departed little from his right-wing opponents.",
      "That alleged caution has been met with opposition from multiple sides.",
      "Many on the left see him as maddeningly unimaginative in the face of a long-term economic malaise that they say requires radical, progressive action. And the right see him as too soft on immigration, most notably the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis that continues to see tens of thousands of asylum seekers cross the English Channel each year.",
      "Immigration is now the top priority for voters, polls show, and opinion surveys are now led by Nigel Farage, the friend and ally of American President Donald Trump, who leads the Reform political party.",
      "If he becomes prime minister after the next election scheduled for 2029, Farage has promised to enact a mass deportation scheme removing 600,000 undocumented migrants from Britain.",
      "A teenage mother who grew up in socialized housing in the northern town of Stockport, Rayner is widely seen as holding an everyman touch that resonated with voters in a way Starmer never has.",
      "She was viewed as a vital weapon in Labour\u2019s defense against the rising working-class anger being so successfully harnessed by Farage \u2014 and therefore her exit represents a powerful loss for the government.",
      "Rayner\u2019s departure is doubly significant because she also quit from the role of deputy party leader, which is chosen by the party members, rather than Starmer himself.",
      "This means a more outspoken left-wing lawmaker could be voted into the role \u2014 increasing the pressure on Starmer to veer left in search of a solution."

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:48:07 GMT",
    "summary": "An iconic winged lion that has perched above Venice for centuries, may have originated in China, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

      "The exchange between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin was caught on a hot mic Wednesday as the duo and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in their first joint public appearance, led a delegation of 27 world leaders attending a massive military parade in Beijing.",
      "State-run broadcaster CCTV was livestreaming the event, which marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and providing the feed to other media organizations.",
      "As they ascended the rostrum at Tiananmen Square to watch the parade, Putin and Xi, who are both 72, appeared to be discussing the world\u2019s strides in life expectancy.",
      "While it used to be rare for people to reach age 70, \u201cnow they say that at 70 you are only a child,\u201d a translator for Xi can be heard telling Putin in Russian.",
      "With advances in biotechnology, people will be able to \u201ctransplant human organs continuously, grow younger with age and perhaps even achieve immortality,\u201d Putin\u2019s translator responds in Mandarin.",
      "Xi, who at that point was off-camera, can then be heard saying, \u201cSome have predicted that by the end of this century, humans could potentially live up to 150 years.\u201d",
      "It was unclear whether the conversation was also being translated for Kim, believed to be 41, who was smiling and looking toward the older leaders.",
      "Though they may have just been making conversation, the exchange holds extra weight because both Putin and Xi have indicated an interest in staying in office as long as possible.",
      "Xi, who has been president since 2013, was awarded a rare third term in 2023 after he removed the two-term limit from the constitution five years earlier, breaking with China\u2019s long-standing tradition of changing leaders every decade. In another departure from historical practice, he has not given any sign of who his successor might be.",
      "Putin, who has been president or prime minister of Russia since 2000, won a controversial referendum in 2020 that amended the constitution to allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036. At that point, he would be 83 and Russia\u2019s longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great.",
      "Putin is known for his long-standing interest in longevity, and last year Russian lawmakers established an anti-aging research center called \u201cNew Health Preservation Technologies\u201d after Putin said the nation should focus on preserving the health of its citizens.",
      "Though Xi does not appear to have the same fixation, Chinese leaders tend to enjoy long lives, with Deng Xiaoping living until 92 and his successor, Jiang Zemin, making it to 96.",
      "Organ transplants are a sensitive subject in China, where rights groups say organs may still be harvested from executed prisoners even after the government pledged to end the controversial practice in 2014. China has long struggled with a shortage of donated organs because of cultural taboos, and in 2023 the government issued new rules tightening regulation and promoting public awareness.",
      "There was little discussion of the two leaders\u2019 impromptu exchange on Chinese social media, which is heavily censored.",
      "Putin confirmed the conversation with Xi when reporters asked about it later Wednesday, saying, \u201cOh, I believe the chairman talked about it when we were going to the parade.\u201d",
      "\u201cModern means, both health improvement, and medical means and even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement, allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\u201d he said.",
      "He also appeared to refer to United Nations estimates that by 2050 there will be more than twice as many people over 60 as children under 5.",
      "\u201cThis will have social, political and economic consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should certainly think about this, too, when we talk about life expectancy.\u201d"

Being made a saint means the church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, his mother, Antonia Salzano, 58, said that in many ways, her son was just like any other teenager who liked playing video games, hanging out with his friends and playing soccer.",

I couldn\u2019t understand how it would be so. But he used what he had in the heart, the love of God, to maximize for spreading the faith,\u201d she added.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Carlo taught himself how to program and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "But while programming was his passion, Salzano said, she thought he would likely have become a priest, as he had asked her about pursuing a career in the church. After receiving his First Communion at the age of 7, he attended daily Mass regularly and taught catechism in a local parish.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to help people to discover their faith, to discover God, the love of God. And all his life was spent for this. Even if he lived a normal life, like young boys of his age,\u201d she added.",
      "At just 15 years old, in October 2006, he fell ill and within 10 days died of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",
      "While his suffering caused her a lot of pain, Salzano said, \u201cif we leave suffering, offering to God, we can be in a certain way a little savior, like Jesus, we can help other people with our prayers.\u201d",
      "While she misses her son, she added that she had faith and knew \u201cthat death is to say goodbye, not the end of everything. But death, as Carlo used to say, is the start of the true life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Carlo was named \u201cvenerable\u201d after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in the small town of Assisi in central Italy.",
      "He asked for that to be his final resting place because of his devotion to the medieval saint St. Francis, whose hometown was Assisi. Wearing a track top, jeans and sneakers, he lies there entombed with a wax mold of his likeness placed over his body.",
      "Today it is a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day, Monsignor Anthony Figueiredo said in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThis is a saint in front of our eyes, and he\u2019s a different kind of saint, you can see with jeans and sneakers and a hoodie exactly as he dressed,\u201d he said, adding that Carlo had been inspired by Apple founder Steve Jobs, who had said that at the end of each day, he had wanted to know he had \u201cdone something wonderful for someone else.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat really sums up Carlo,\u201d Figueiredo said, adding that the teenager really strove to do something differently. \u201cOne of Carlo\u2019s sayings, \u2018All of us are born originals, but so many of us end up as photocopies.\u2019 We just want to be like the crowd and be like others. And Carlo said, \u2018You need to be original.\u2019\u201d",
      "Explaining Carlo\u2019s popularity, he recounted an interaction with a Mexican student who told him, \u201cI cannot wear the sack cloth of Francis of Assisi. I cannot do the penances of Claire of Assisi, but I do have a pair of jeans, and I do wear trainers.\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s ceremony in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, in conjunction with the celebration of the Holy Year\u2019s jubilee for teens, was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Francis, who called the internet a \u201cgift from God\u201d and encouraged the Vatican to use technology.",
      "It will be the first time Leo, elected in May to replace Francis, has presided over such an event.",
      "It is impossible to quantify exactly how many saints there are. During the church\u2019s first 1,000 years, they were proclaimed by popular demand, but some estimates have the number exceeding 10,000.",
      "Other saints who died at a young age include Therese of Lisieux, who was known for promoting a \u201cLittle Way\u201d of charity and died at 24 in 1897, and Aloysius Gonzaga, who died at 23 in 1591 after caring for victims of an epidemic in Rome.",
      "As for Carlo, his mother said she thought her son was \u201ca sign of hope\u201d and that it was \u201cimportant to remind young people that they are unique.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike Carlo did, he could become holy in this world,\u201d Salzano said. \u201cYou too can do the same. You too can overcome this and can do important things as well.\u201d"

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",
      "People and organizations in China are bound by law to follow instructions from health officials in containing the virus. Failure to comply can lead to warnings, fines and even civil liability.",
      "Some have criticized the government\u2019s campaign as overkill reminiscent of Covid-era public health controls, while others have praised the quick, large-scale action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed,\u201d a user wrote on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit too much to dump out even the cats\u2019 water bowls. That\u2019s a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s strict controls have curbed the outbreak. As of Aug. 25, Foshan had kept new daily cases under 50 for nine days. Health officials announced that the city of more than 9 million people had ended its public health emergency response, which lasted for about a month.",
      "Experts say the bigger challenge is the impact of climate change, as rising temperatures and more severe weather create new habitats for virus-carrying mosquitos to thrive and spread diseases.",
      "Because of unusually hot weather in recent years, there has been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of locally acquired chikungunya cases in areas that had been unaffected by the virus for the past decade, such as Europe, Chan said.",
      "\u201cRemember, humans are not alone in this globe. We\u2019re living with animals, birds, various other species, as well as all these vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks and other vectors,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re just one part of the ecosystem.\u201d",

      "The College of Charleston confirmed on Friday that one of its instructors was among the 16 people killed in the crash of the popular funicular railway in Lisbon on Wednesday, which shocked Portugal and led to pointed questions about the cause of the accident.",
      "Heather Hall, a faculty member in the school\u2019s department of teacher education, was the only American killed in the accident, which also injured 21. Among the dead were five Portuguese citizens, two South Koreans, one Swiss, three British citizens, two Canadians, one French and one Ukrainian, according to Portuguese police.",
      "Hall had been in Lisbon to speak at a conference, Fran Welch, the dean of the School of Education, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis is a tragic loss for all of us,\" Welch said. \"As an alumna of the College (\u201897) and a dynamic instructor with a specialization is special education, she shared her love of travel with her students.\"",
      "The statement noted that Hall had been a Fulbright Scholar in Ghana and had taken her students on study abroad trips to Italy.",
      "Welch added, \"Her energy, kindness and student-centeredness will be deeply missed.\"",
      "Hall's passion for travel is highlighted on her Facebook page, which shows photos of her in Havana, Venice and at the Colosseum in Rome.",
      "The wreckage of the funicular, known as the Elevador da Gl\u00f3ria, was cleared overnight and put in police custody.",
      "Alexandre Rodrigues, the commander of the Lisbon fire brigade, told reporters Wednesday that authorities were alerted about the derailment at 6:01 p.m. local time (12:01 p.m. ET) and arrived within three minutes. The funicular derailed and crashed into a building, he said.",
      "Becky Britton, of Minnesota, was vacationing in the city with her husband when she walked past the scene and saw what she described as carnage.",
      "\u201cI feel sad, and when you\u2019re here it\u2019s real. If it happened to us, our families, we would have been notified and that\u2019s just devastating,\u201d she said.",
      "Emergency officials said all victims were pulled out of the wreckage in just over two hours.",
      "Classified as a national monument, the Elevador da Gl\u00f3ria funicular connected Restauradores Square to the Jardim de S\u00e3o Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, a popular garden in the Bairro Alto neighborhood.",
      "The service, which was inaugurated in 1885, goes up and down a few hundred yards of a hill on a curved, traffic-free road in tandem with one going the opposite way. It is a popular attraction with Lisbon\u2019s tourists, and long lines of people typically form for the brief rides.",
      "Harnessed by steel cables, it can carry more than 40 people, seated and standing, and it is also commonly used by Lisbon residents.",
      "The government\u2019s Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations is expected to release a preliminary technical report on the accident on Saturday."

      "The two leaders met for the first time in six years on Thursday in Beijing, where Kim had traveled to attend a massive military parade in a rare departure from his isolated, nuclear-armed state.",
      "The \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade, which commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, was the first time Xi, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin had been seen in public together.",
      "Their joint appearance symbolized their countries\u2019 growing challenge to U.S. power on the global stage, as Putin brushes off President Donald Trump\u2019s push to end his invasion of Ukraine and North Korea dismisses Trump\u2019s interest in reviving denuclearization talks.",
      "But relations between North Korea and China, its neighbor and biggest trading partner, have been strained by Kim\u2019s support for Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency said this week that an estimated 2,000 of the approximately 15,000 North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russia had been killed, and Putin thanked Kim for his country\u2019s sacrifice at their own bilateral summit on Wednesday.",
      "Experts say Kim, who is in dire need of economic assistance, may be trying to mend ties with Beijing as a hedge against the possible end of the war in Ukraine and the leverage he has gained with Russia.",
      "The Xi-Kim summit \u201csuggests more than a simple restoration of ties,\u201d said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyungnam University. \u201cIt points to the possibility of a new leap forward.\u201d",
      "It was an opportunity for North Korea to reaffirm China\u2019s backing amid international sanctions and isolation, and an opportunity for China to show its intention to maintain influence over the Korean Peninsula through Pyongyang, he said.",
      "Chinese state media also confirmed the Xi-Kim summit.",
      "Like Kim, Xi said China and North Korea\u2019s commitment to developing bilateral relations \u201cwill not change regardless of how the international situation evolves,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "Xi told Kim that China and North Korea, which are both communist-run states, are \u201cgood neighbors, good friends and good comrades who share a common destiny.\u201d",
      "Kim, who had not been to China since 2019, said the military parade and related events were \u201cgrand and magnificent\u201d and \u201cunderscored China\u2019s significant international status and influence,\u201d according to China\u2019s state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "\u201cNo matter how the world changes, this friendship will never change,\u201d he said.",

      "During their meeting at the Great Hall of the People, the two leaders also discussed strengthening strategic cooperation, defending common interests in international and regional affairs and conducting more high-level visits, Chinese and North Korean state media reported. The meeting was followed by a small-group tea meeting and banquet.",
      "KCNA confirmed Friday that Kim had arrived home from Beijing on his private train, saying he was seen off at Beijing Railway Station by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior Chinese officials.",
      "The agency said the North Korean leader\u2019s visit to China was \u201ca historic occasion which further strengthened the political trust and strategic cooperation\u201d between the two countries and \u201cshowed the invariability and invincibility\u201d of their relations, which have overcome \u201call sorts of trials and challenges.\u201d",
      "By stressing the unchanging nature of their relationship despite international shifts, \u201cthe summit also gave North Korea grounds to justify holding on to its nuclear weapons,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWith China voicing support for Pyongyang\u2019s own \u2018core interests,\u2019 Beijing can be seen as tacitly acknowledging North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d",
      "But China, which prefers stability on the Korean Peninsula, could still play a positive role as mediator, he said.",
      "\u201cChina may well use economic cooperation as leverage to press Pyongyang to ease tensions in the interest of regional stability,\u201d Lim said.",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 He\u2019s quipped more than once that President Donald Trump misheard Israel\u2019s request for a \u201cMaccabee\u201d \u2014 an ancient Jewish warrior \u2014 and instead sent a \u201cHuckabee.\u201d",
      "But U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says his devotion to Israel, and conviction that he is carrying out God\u2019s work in the Holy Land, is no joke.",
      "\u201cWe share a value system that is rooted deeply in a biblical understanding of a worldview that says that the individual is important,\u201d the Baptist minister, 70, said of Israel and the U.S. during a wide-ranging interview with NBC News last week. \u201cThat is, in my mind, the very essence of Western civilization. And it is on that platform that both the United States and Israel are built and that puts us in a very, very special relationship.\u201d",
      "Huckabee\u2019s strong ties to Israel were forged during more than 100 visits to the country before his appointment and are grounded in a belief that God commanded Jewish sovereignty over their biblical homeland.",
      "His ambassadorship could end up being deeply consequential. Not only was it a win for the evangelical Christian community, a vital part of Trump\u2019s base, but it was also a boon to Israel\u2019s far-right government as it faces unprecedented criticism for its war in the Gaza Strip. His stances in just over six months in Israel have hewn closely to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s, even as Trump expresses occasional unease with the close U.S. ally\u2019s conduct.",

      "The following month, on Aug. 22, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger, officially declared famine in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. For months before that announcement, international humanitarian organizations had warned that the trickle of aid Israel had allowed into the enclave wasn\u2019t nearly enough to feed its population of 2.1 million."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has grown increasingly pessimistic about the chance of brokering an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict any time soon.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has grown increasingly pessimistic about the chance of brokering an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict anytime soon or seeing the leaders of the two warring countries meet in person, according to two senior administration officials.",
      "Trump isn\u2019t abandoning hopes of settling the dispute: He joined a conference call Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, in which he stressed that \u201cEurope must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\u201d a White House official said. Trump also made the point that European leaders must subject China to economic pressure for underwriting the Russian war effort, the official added.",
      "But Trump\u2019s more dour view of reaching a peace deal underscores the distance he has traveled since the 2024 campaign, when he brashly predicted he\u2019d end the war within 24 hours of taking office. (He later said he was speaking \u201cfiguratively.\u201d) Trump has since acknowledged that the war has proved a more stubborn problem than he expected.",
      "Whirlwind peacemaking efforts last month appear to have stalled. Amid expectations of an elusive breakthrough, Trump flew to Anchorage, Alaska, on Aug. 15 for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He touched down in Alaska hoping for a ceasefire and left hours later without one.",
      "Three days later, Trump convened a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy and European leaders. Afterward, he announced that Putin and Zelenskyy would meet for the first time since the war began in February 2022, raising hopes that a rapprochement might be in sight.",
      "That meeting still hasn\u2019t happened, and there\u2019s no sign it will. During a visit to China this week, Putin said he will end the war by force if Ukraine doesn\u2019t agree to his demands. And he said he would meet with Zelenskyy only in Moscow, the Russian capital.",
      "Zelenskyy is willing to meet with Putin in certain Persian Gulf countries, Switzerland, Austria, Turkey and elsewhere \u2014 but not on Putin\u2019s turf, a Ukrainian adviser said.",
      "\u201cWe see nonstop obstacles to peace from Russia\u2019s side and fake arguments from Russia as to why there can\u2019t be a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy in the same room,\u201d Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said in an interview.",
      "Asked whether he had a message for Putin, Trump told reporters at the White House this week: \u201cI have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand, and he\u2019ll make a decision one way or the other. Whatever his decision is, we\u2019ll either be happy about it or unhappy. And if we\u2019re unhappy about it, you\u2019ll see things happen.\u201d",
      "As the peace talks bog down, the casualties continue to mount. Just last week, Russia launched a massive attack on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, that killed at least 15 people, including four children. Since Russia sent tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, casualties on both sides have reached about 1.5 million.",
      "A European source, speaking on condition of anonymity, spoke Thursday about being frustrated that the Trump administration hasn\u2019t imposed meaningful new sanctions on Russia as a prod to end the war.",
      "Leshchenko said, \u201cThe pressure on Putin has to be really harsh so that he will not be able to continue his war machine.\u201d",
      "A complication may be Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin; he has told his advisers that he\u2019s determined not to wreck it, two people briefed on his comments said. Dating to his first term, Trump has said it\u2019s in America\u2019s interest for him to be on civil terms with his Russian counterpart, who presides over a nuclear arsenal.",
      "A potential advantage in retaining a leader-to-leader rapport with Putin is that Trump can position himself as a mediator both sides can trust, a Western official said in an interview. He enjoys leverage with both Putin and Zelenskyy, whose country depends on U.S. arms and money for survival.",
      "In that vein, Trump last month was heard on a hot mic telling French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin wants to make a deal \u201cfor me \u2026 as crazy as it sounds.\u201d",
      "While sanctions are a tool that may wrest concessions from Putin, they carry a downside in that each escalatory twist jeopardizes Trump\u2019s role as a fair broker, the official said. The challenge, the official added, is to adeptly time the sanctions and \u201cdial back\u201d when progress is made.",
      "Another consideration is that sanctions can reverberate in unexpected ways. An administration official pointed to India as a cautionary example. When the United States doubled its tariff rate on India as punishment for buying Russian oil, American relations with India soured. This week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned up in China for an event hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The United States has long seen India as a vital democratic partner in countering Chinese and Russian influence around the world.",
      "Yet in China, Modi was seen holding hands with Putin and speaking warmly to Xi. Images of Modi cozying up to Russia and China, the administration official said, were \u201cnot great.\u201d",
      "Brett Bruen, who was White House director of global engagement in the Obama administration, said in an interview: \u201cWe spent the last decade trying to build up an Indo-Pacific partnership with a view toward limiting the spread of China\u2019s adversarial actions. Trump just took a bazooka to it.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe are cooperating with law enforcement and are committed to abiding by all labor and immigration regulations,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "It remains unclear how many people have been taken into custody, but Schrank said, \u201cWe are making many arrests of undocumented individuals.\u201d",

      "The ICE spokesperson added: \u201cThis investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for those who violate the law and upholding the rule of law. Complex cases like this require strong collaboration and extensive investigative efforts.\u201d",
      "South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States.

      "\u201cTrump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\" a White House official told NBC News on Thursday after Trump spoke to European leaders. The official added that he also told the leaders they had to \u201cplace economic pressure on China for funding Russia\u2019s war efforts.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday during a visit to Beijing that he will end the war by force if Ukraine does not agree to his demands. He suggested he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but only in Moscow.",

President Trump\u2019s principle of \u2018peace through strength\u2019 is exactly the kind of approach that can influence the aggressor.\"",
      "For Trump, the war is proving harder to resolve than his onetime claim that he would be able to fix the situation in 24 hours.
