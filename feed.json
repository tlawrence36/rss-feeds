      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "The champ is coming back to chomp.",
      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.

      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",
      "Carpenter revealed the title and release date for her new album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d on Wednesday.

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",
      "Asked his favorite, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve all been good, for different reasons. The first one was great, the last one was great.\u201d",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",

      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "Cancer patients say they\u2019ve grown sicker since Argentina\u2019s radical libertarian President Javier Milei took his chainsaw to the public health system",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, and white people account for the vast majority of the deaths",
      "NEW YORK -- Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, according to a new federal report published Wednesday, with white people accounting for the vast majority of the deaths.",
      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",
      "Representatives for HHS, the CDC and the cities did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",

      "ATLANTA -- The baby of a woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead and has been on life support since February was delivered early Friday morning, her mother said.",
      "April Newkirk told WXIA-TV that 31-year-old Adriana Smith's baby was born prematurely by an emergency cesarean section early Friday, the Atlanta station reported Monday night. She was about six months into her pregnancy. The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s expected to be okay,\u201d Newkirk told the TV station. \u201cHe\u2019s just fighting. We just want prayers for him.\"",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead. She was eight weeks pregnant, according to WXIA.",

      "The Associated Press reached called and emailed Emory Tuesday for comment. It is unclear why Emory decided to deliver the baby. The Associated Press has also tried to contact Newkirk.",
      "Smith's family said Emory doctors told them they were not allowed to remove the devices keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",

    "summary": "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
    "story": [
      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",
      "Alexis McGill-Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said it's almost been a challenge to fund abortion \u2014 and all health care \u2014 for low-income people.",
      "\u201cIf the market could have figured it out,\" she said, \"then we wouldn't exist.\u201d",

      "The move comes nearly two months after U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to phase out petroleum-based artificial colors in the nation\u2019s food supply.",
      "Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don't contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",
      "Kraft Heinz said that many of its U.S. products that still use the FD&C colors are in its beverage and desserts categories, including certain products sold under brands including Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.",
      "The company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.",
      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients has lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers on Monday, after a judge stepped in for a jury on grounds the evidence presented by the defendants was incontrovertible.",
      "Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh issued his directed verdict against former doctor William Husel, whose attorneys accused Michigan-based Trinity Health and Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus of orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation.",
      "Husel was seeking more than $18 million from the health care companies.",
      "His attorney, David Vermillion, said in a statement that Husel's legal team was disappointed that McIntosh would prevent the jury from making a decision in the case after weeks of evidence and testimony had been presented. He said issuing the directed verdict, a procedural move requested by the hospital, \u201ceffectively silences the voices of those who came seeking justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the outcome that any reasonable person expected, nor is it one that reflects the strength of the evidence presented,\" he said. \u201cWe are evaluating all legal options, including appeal. This case has always been about more than one courtroom or one ruling. It is about truth, accountability, and the right of every individual to defend their name against false and damaging accusations.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel issued a statement that said simply, \u201cWe are pleased with the judge\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel Health System fired the doctor in 2018 after it concluded he had ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years.",
      "He initially was charged with murder in 25 deaths in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. Eleven counts were dismissed before trial.",
      "Husel, now 49, maintained he was trying to help patients deal with their pain, sometimes in the last moments of their life, not speed up their deaths. Despite being found not guilty by a jury on murder charges in 2022, he permanently surrendered his medical license.",
      "He filed multiple lawsuits against his former employer, accusing Trinity Health and Mount Carmel of defamation and malicious prosecution.",
      "As part of the defamation lawsuit filed in 2019, Husel\u2019s attorneys said Trinity Health repeatedly spread lies and false information to convince the public and law enforcement that Husel was a killer, even though health system officials knew that was not true.",
      "\u201cObviously, these false allegations destroyed Dr. Husel\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit said. Husel gave up his medical license because his lawyers said that he knew the damage to his reputation would prevent him from working as a doctor.",
      "In court documents filed two years ago, Husel said he had been unable to find work and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.",
      "Trinity Health had asked a judge to toss the lawsuit, but a Franklin County judge ruled there was enough reason to move forward.",
      "Husel, who worked in the intensive care unit, was charged in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for nonsurgical situations indicated an intent to end lives.",
      "His colleagues who administered the medications at Mount Carmel West Hospital in Columbus weren\u2019t criminally charged, but the hospital said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation and referred various employees to their respective state boards for disciplinary action.",
      "The hospital reached settlements in multiple cases involving relatives of the patients who died.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",

      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",
      "Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.",
      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",
      "Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.",
      "\u201cYes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,\" Landry said a statement. \"It\u2019s that important.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",
      "But it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",
      "Pills can arrive in a less than a week.",
      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",

      "\u201cI have been working in this field for 25 years and this is part of the work,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, founder and director of Aid Access, an abortion pill supplier. \u201dIt\u2019s something that we all anticipated would happen,\" she said of the legal challenges.",
      "A doctor who is part of A Safe Choice, a network of California-based physicians that prescribes abortion pills to women in all 50 states, told The Associated Press he believes he is protected by the state's shield law, but is also taking precautions.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is up to 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year",
      "The U.S. logged fewer than 30 measles cases this week as Ohio health officials confirmed three outbreaks in two counties were over.",
      "There have been 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed two cases in the last week.",
      "There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2,083 cases from mid-October through June 10. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.",
      "Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 868 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,179 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.",
      "Other U.S. states with active outbreaks \u2014 which the CDC defines as three or more related cases \u2014 include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.",
      "In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that\u2019s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "There are a total of 744 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Tuesday.",
      "Throughout the outbreak, 96 people have been hospitalized.",
      "State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases \u2014 fewer than 10 \u2014 are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas\u2019 cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 411 cases since late January \u2014 just under 2% of the county\u2019s residents.",
      "The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of \u201cwhat the child\u2019s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.\u201d A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.",
      "New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.",
      "Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Don\u0303a Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.",
      "An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.",
      "Oklahoma stayed steady Friday with a total of 16 confirmed and three probable cases.",
      "The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.",
      "Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said Monday. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.",
      "Colorado has seen a total of 14 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of eight related cases.",
      "The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May, and includes four cases in Arapahoe County, three in El Paso County and one in Denver, plus a person who doesn't live in Colorado.",
      "Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.",
      "Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following week, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.",
      "The state's other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.",
      "Kansas has a total of 76 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but two of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.",
      "Montana had 20 measles cases as of Tuesday. Twelve were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up \u2014 Montana\u2019s first in 35 years.",
      "Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.",
      "There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.",
      "North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.",
      "There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.",
      "Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.",
      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

      "DENPASAR, Indonesia -- Indonesian police say they are detaining three suspects for murder after an Australian tourist was shot to death at a villa in the resort island of Bali.",
      "\u201cWe have successfully arrested three suspects last night,\u201d Bali Police Chief Daniel Adityajaya told reporters in Denpasar, the provincial capital.",
      "\u201cThe three suspects are Australian men and they are now being held and questioned for further investigation,\u201d he said.",
      "Zivan Radmanovic, a 32-year-old from Melbourne, was killed just after midnight on June 13 at a villa near Munggu Beach in Bali\u2019s Badung district. A second man, a 34-year-old from Melbourne, was left beaten in the attack.",
      "Police earlier said they had detained two suspects, but further investigation led police to arrest a third man who helped them to prepare the killing, Adityajaya said.",
      "Witnesses at the villa told investigators that two gunmen arrived on a scooter at the villa around midnight.",
      "Radmanovic was shot in a bathroom of his room, where police found 17 bullet casings and two intact bullets.",
      "Radmanovic\u2019s wife, Gourdeas Jazmyn, 30, told police that she suddenly woke up when she heard her husband screaming. She cowered under a blanket when she heard multiple gunshots.",
      "She later found her husband\u2019s body and the other injured Australian, whose wife also testified to seeing the attackers.",
      "Adityajaya said based on the facts and evidences collected by police on the ground, \u201cWe have confidence that the three (suspects) are the perpetrators.\u201d",
      "Two of the men were arrested late Tuesday in Singapore and at Jakarta's Soekarno Hatta International Airport, while trying to flee. Indonesian police didn\u2019t say where the third suspect was apprehended.",
      "Adityajaya said the men are now being held in Bali and can face various charges, including murder and firearm charges, that could carry up to a life sentence or the death penalty if found guilty.",
      "He said police are still investigating the motive and how they got the weapon as firearm ownership and use are heavily regulated in Indonesia.",
      "\u201cWe are still investigating the possibility of other suspects,\u201d Adityajaya said.",
      "He praised the collaboration between Indonesian police and immigration agencies in tracking the whereabouts of the suspects with the support of the Australian Federal Police and Interpol in the Southeast Asia region.",

    "story": [
      "In Gaza and Africa, U.S. contracting firms led by former American intelligence and military officers are taking on aid delivery in conflict zones",
      "ON A PLANE OVER UPPER NILE STATE, South Sudan -- Swooping low over the banks of a Nile River tributary, an aid flight run by retired American military officers released a stream of food-stuffed sacks over a town emptied by fighting in South Sudan, a country wracked by conflict.",
      "Last week's air drop was the latest in a controversial development \u2014 private contracting firms led by former U.S. intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones, in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.",
      "The moves are roiling the global aid community, which warns of a more militarized, politicized and profit-seeking trend that could allow governments or combatants to use life-saving aid to control hungry civilian populations and advance war aims.",
      "In South Sudan and Gaza, two for-profit U.S. companies led by American national security veterans are delivering aid in operations backed by the South Sudanese and Israeli governments.",
      "The American contractors say they're putting their security, logistics and intelligence skills to work in relief operations. Fogbow, the U.S. company that carried out last week's air drops over South Sudan, says it aims to be a \u201chumanitarian\u201d force.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked for careers, collectively, in conflict zones. And we know how to essentially make very difficult situations work,\u201d said Fogbow President Michael Mulroy, a retired CIA officer and former senior defense official in the first Trump administration, speaking on the airport tarmac in Juba, South Sudan's capital.",
      "But the U.N. and many leading non-profit groups say U.S. contracting firms are stepping into aid distribution with little transparency or humanitarian experience, and, crucially, without commitment to humanitarian principles of neutrality and operational independence in war zones.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years of successes and failures is there\u2019s a difference between a logistics operation and a security operation, and a humanitarian operation,\u201d said Scott Paul, a director at Oxfam America.",
      "\u201c\u2018Truck and chuck\u2019 doesn\u2019t help people,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt puts people at risk.\u201d",
      "Fogbow took journalists up in a cargo plane to watch their team drop 16 tons of beans, corn and salt for South Sudan's Upper Nile state town of Nasir.",
      "Residents fled homes there after fighting erupted in March between the government and opposition groups.",
      "Mulroy acknowledged the controversy over Fogbow's aid drops, which he said were paid for by the South Sudanese government.",
      "But, he maintained: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to replace any entity\u201d in aid work.",
      "Fogbow was in the spotlight last year for its proposal to use barges to bring aid to Gaza, where Israeli restrictions were blocking overland deliveries. The United States focused instead on a U.S. military effort to land aid via a temporary pier.",
      "Since then, Fogbow has carried out aid drops in Sudan and South Sudan, east African nations where wars have created some of the world's gravest humanitarian crises.",
      "Fogbow says ex-humanitarian officials are also involved, including former U.N. World Food Program head David Beasley, who is a senior adviser.",
      "Operating in Gaza, meanwhile, Safe Reach Solutions, led by a former CIA officer and other retired U.S. security officers, has partnered with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed nonprofit that Israel says is the linchpin of a new aid system to wrest control from the U.N., which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Starting in late May, the American-led operation in Gaza has distributed food at fixed sites in southern Gaza, in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated plan to use aid to concentrate the territory's more than 2 million people in the south, freeing Israel to fight Hamas elsewhere. Aid workers fear it's a step toward another of Netanyahu\u2019s public goals, removing Palestinians from Gaza in \u201cvoluntary\u201d migrations.",
      "Since then, several hundred Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in near daily shootings as they tried to reach aid sites, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Witnesses say Israeli troops regularly fire heavy barrages toward the crowds in an attempt to control them.",
      "The Israeli military has denied firing on civilians. It says it fired warning shots in several instances, and fired directly at a few \u201csuspects\u201d who ignored warnings and approached its forces.",
      "It\u2019s unclear who is funding the new operation in Gaza. No donor has come forward, and the U.S. says it\u2019s not funding it.",
      "In response to criticism over its Gaza aid deliveries, Safe Reach Solutions said it has former aid workers on its team with \u201cdecades of experience in the world\u2019s most complex environments\u201d who bring \"expertise to the table, along with logisticians and other experts.\u201c",
      "Last week's air drop over South Sudan went without incident, despite fighting nearby. A white cross marked the drop zone. Only a few people could be seen. Fogbow contractors said there were more newly returned townspeople on previous drops.",
      "Fogbow acknowledges glitches in mastering aid drops, including one last year in Sudan\u2019s South Kordofan region that ended up with too-thinly-wrapped grain sacks split open on the ground.",
      "After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan has struggled to emerge from a civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. Rights groups say its government is one of the world\u2019s most corrupt, and until now has invested little in quelling the dire humanitarian crisis.",
      "South Sudan said it engaged Fogbow for air drops partly because of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cuts in U.S. Agency for International Development funding. Humanitarian Minister Albino Akol Atak said the drops will expand to help people in need throughout the country.",
      "But two South Sudanese groups question the government's motives.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a humanitarian space being abused by military actors ... under the cover of a food drop,\" said Edmund Yakani, head of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a local civil society group.",
      "Asked about suspicions the aid drops were helping South Sudan's military aims, Fogbow's Mulroy said the group has worked with the U.N. World Food Program to make sure \u201cthis aid is going to civilians.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it wasn't going to civilians, we would hope that we would get that feedback, and we would cease and desist,\u201d Mulroy said.",
      "In a statement, WFP country director Mary-Ellen McGroarty said: \u201cWFP is not involved in the planning, targeting or distribution of food air-dropped\u201d by Fogbow on behalf of South Sudan's government, citing humanitarian principles.",
      "Longtime humanitarian leaders and analysts are troubled by what they see as a teaming up of warring governments and for-profit contractors in aid distribution.",
      "When one side in a conflict decides where and how aid is handed out, and who gets it, \u201cit will always result in some communities getting preferential treatment,\u201d said Jan Egeland, executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council.",
      "Sometimes, that set-up will advance strategic aims, as with Netanyahu's plans to move Gaza's civilians south, Egeland said.",
      "The involvement of soldiers and security workers, he added, can make it too \u201cintimidating\u201d for some in need to even try to get aid.",
      "Until now, Western donors always understood those risks, Egeland said. But pointing to the Trump administration's backing of the new aid system in Gaza, he asked: \u201cWhy does the U.S. ... want to support what they have resisted with every other war zone for two generations?\u201d",
      "Mark Millar, who has advised the U.N. and Britain on humanitarian matters in South Sudan and elsewhere, said involving private military contractors risks undermining the distinction between humanitarian assistance and armed conflict.",
      "Private military contractors \u201chave even less sympathy for a humanitarian perspective that complicates their business-driven model,\" he said. \u201cAnd once let loose, they seem to be even less accountable.\u201d",

      "For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the bilateral meetings scheduled on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada were even more important than the summit itself",
      "MEXICO CITY -- For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the bilateral meetings scheduled on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada Tuesday were even more important than the summit itself and her first face-to-face dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump was to headline her trip.",
      "But Trump\u2019s decision to return to Washington early left a gaping hole in Mexico\u2019s schedule and delayed a much anticipated encounter. Sheinbaum had been expected to continue making the case for Mexican strides in security and immigration, while negotiating to lift steel and aluminum tariffs and lobbying to kill a proposed tax on money Mexicans in the U.S. send home.",
      "Sheinbaum said on X Tuesday that she had spoken with Trump by phone who explained that he had to return to Washington to stay on top of the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. \u201cWe agreed to work together to soon reach an agreement on various issues that concern us today,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Sheinbaum was not the only world leader stood up by Trump, but she has developed one of the more intriguing relationships with the unpredictable U.S. president.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s success at managing the bilateral relationship has been such that some began to wonder aloud if she was a Trump whisperer. Most significantly, she has avoided two tariff threats that could have been devastating to Mexico\u2019s economy.",
      "She has done it by affording Trump the respect any U.S. president would expect from their neighbor, deploying occasional humor and pushing back \u2014 respectfully \u2014 when necessary.",
      "Jorge Alberto Schiavon Uriegas, a professor in the International Studies department at Mexico's Iberoamerican University, said the first Trump meeting was setting up well for Sheinbaum because it was on neutral territory and it was closed door, unlike some recent Oval Office meetings that have gone poorly for leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "\u201cIt would allow them to advance privately the bilateral agenda or better said, (advance) diplomatically without lights, the main issues of the bilateral agenda,\u201d Schiavon Uriegas said.",
      "The agenda remains largely unchanged, but with a rearrangement of priorities for both countries.",
      "The decline in cross-border migration has removed the issue from the top agenda for the first time in years.",
      "On security, Sheinbaum has blunted some of the Trump administration\u2019s tough talk on fentanyl and organized crime by more actively pursuing drug cartels.",
      "In February, Mexico sent more than two dozen drug cartel figures to the U.S., including Rafael Caro Quintero, long sought in the 1985 killing of a DEA agent. That show of goodwill, and a much more visible effort against fentanyl production, has garnered a positive response from the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI think there is going to be greater (security) cooperation now...greater than ever,\u201d U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told reporters Monday, after returning from a visit with Sheinbaum.",
      "The threat to remittance income, whether through a proposed tax or increased deportations, is real for Mexico. Nearly $65 billion was sent home to Mexico last year, so it was news earlier this month when Mexico reported that remittances were down 12% in April compared with the same month last year, the largest drop in more than a decade. Sheinbaum suggested it could be related to Trump administration immigration policies.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s attendance alone signals an important prioritization of foreign policy for Mexico after six years in which her predecessor, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, repeatedly skipped multilateral gatherings like the G7.",
      "\u201cIt allows Mexico to reposition itself in the most important spaces of dialogue and coordination at a global level,\u201d Schiavon Uriegas said.",
      "Michael Shifter, adjunct professor of Latin American Politics at Georgetown University, said that while the canceled Trump meeting was a loss, Sheinbaum\u2019s other bilateral meetings with leaders from India, Germany and Canada should not be discounted.",
      "\u201cMexico is in a moment of looking for and diversifying allies,\" Shifter said.",
      "Still, an in-person Trump meeting \u2014 whenever it happens \u2014 will be key for Sheinbaum. While her top Cabinet secretaries have made numerous trips to Washington to discuss security and trade with their U.S. counterparts, Trump is the one who counts.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s only one person who makes decisions here,\u201d Shifter said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure and trust in anything until President Trump decides.\u201d",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenyan police shot an apparent bystander at close range Tuesday during the latest protests over the killing of a blogger in custody earlier this month, sparking more fury among the public and demands for accountability.",
      "An Associated Press journalist saw the officer, who had concealed his face with a mask, shoot the unarmed man at close range with what appeared to be a shotgun. The man, who had been holding a packet of face masks, was believed to be a vendor caught up in a confrontation with two officers while standing on a Nairobi sidewalk. One officer shot him in the head as he walked away.",
      "The man was being treated at Kenya's largest referral government hospital, along with 10 others injured in the demonstration. The hospital spokesperson said the injuries included gunshot wounds.",
      "Police in a statement expressed concern and said the officer had been arrested.",
      "Hundreds of protesters on Tuesday clashed with police in the capital while demanding the arrest of the deputy inspector general of police, Eliud Langat, who had filed a defamation complaint against the blogger, Albert Ojwang. Ojwang was arrested on June 6 and died in custody.",
      "Langat on Monday said he had stepped aside to pave the way for investigations and would cooperate with investigating agencies. The officer commanding the Central Police Station where the blogger died, Samson Talam, and colleague James Mukhwana were arrested last week.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s protests turned violent after motorcycle riders accosted protesters and passersby, snatching phones and bags. Protesters set a motorcycle ablaze, and several riders and protesters were injured.",
      "Kenya has a history of police brutality, and President William Ruto previously vowed to end it, along with extrajudicial killings.",
      "Last year, several activists and protesters were abducted and killed by Kenyan police during finance bill protests. The demonstrations led to calls for Ruto's removal.",

      "Investigators say a former student who killed nine students and a teacher in Austria a week ago and then took his own life had become fascinated with school shootings in recent years",
      "VIENNA -- A former student who killed nine students and a teacher in Austria a week ago and then took his own life had become fascinated with school shootings in recent years, but his motive for the rampage remains unclear, investigators said Tuesday.",
      "Police have said the 21-year-old gunman planned last Tuesday's roughly seven-minute attack at the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz, which he left three years ago, down to the smallest detail. But much remains uncertain: among other things, why he chose that particular date and why he stopped shooting when he did.",
      "After his body was found, investigators found that the shooter still had 24 bullets in two magazines and another 18 loose bullets for his Glock handgun, as well as 17 bullets for his shotgun, said Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province\u2019s criminal police office.",
      "A few minutes before the shooting began, the gunman took a picture showing his legs and boots in a school bathroom and posted it to a social media account, Lohnegger said. Investigators are still working through some 30 other accounts attributed to him, created between 2019 and this year, to determine which are genuine.",
      "They can \u201csay with certainty that, over the years, he developed a significant passion in general terms for the phenomenon of school shootings,\u201d Lohnegger said. \u201cHe glorifies not just the acts in general, but also the perpetrators who carried out these acts.\"",
      "However, he said, police still have no information on his motive for the shooting.",
      "Eleven people were wounded last week. As of Tuesday, two had been released from hospitals but nine were still being treated, two of whom were still in intensive care, Lohnegger said. Their lives were not in danger.",
      "Chancellor Christian Stocker said Monday that Austria will tighten its gun laws, which are among the more liberal in the European Union. The gunman owned the two firearms he used legally.",

      "The Spanish Steps take their name from the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See in the nearby square. A famed background for numerous films, they were built in the 1720s and have long been a popular spot to people watch and hang out.",

      "The 76-square-meter (818-square-foot) construction was unveiled Sunday in the Nordhavn \u2014 \u201cNorth Harbor\u201d \u2014 district on the outskirts of Copenhagen. After months of construction, it's now an outpost of the local Evangelical-Lutheran Hans Egedes Church.",
      "The parish's leaders saw a need for extra spiritual space as the Danish capital is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade. In Nordhavn alone, the former fishing port is already seeing an influx of new housing projects, bringing with them an estimated 40,000 new residents over the next four decades.",

Today, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d project manager Johanne Dal-Lewkovitch said. \u201cYou build the city, and then there\u2019s a need for a church. So it\u2019s a little bit strange.\u201d",
      "In Denmark, a nation of 6 million people, more than 70% of the population are registered members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church, but few Danes go to church on a regular basis. In fact, many go just once a year, on Christmas Eve.",
      "But this tiny church is expected to be popular for weddings, baptisms, funerals and other more intimate services because of its cozy interior. Only 40 to 50 people can fit inside its 12 walls \u2014 one wall for each apostle \u2014 beneath a skylight.",
      "\u201cOne of the important things is that we also are different compared to other churches,\u201d parish priest Christian Bro said. \u201cHere, we have a very, very small church and that creates a different room, another feeling.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the first in maybe a new modern church world, you can say,\u201d Bro said.",
      "The \u201cTiny Church\u201d concept was first seen in Amsterdam suburb Almere Poort, where Dutch church leaders saw the need for a new location where believers could meet, talk and worship together.",
      "Echoing early Viking churches once seen across this Scandinavian nation, the new church is built almost entirely from wood, including recycled timber donated by a local flooring factory. It\u2019s insulated with newspapers, and the interior has been painted white to match the matte white rock surfaces seen in more traditional Danish churches.",
      "While its home is in Nordhavn for now, its metal stilts mean that it can be easily picked up and moved elsewhere.",
      "It can be \u201cput it up some other place where there\u2019s another need in another parish, maybe in Denmark,\" Dal-Lewkovitch said.",
      "Local churchgoer Katrine Sihm said that she has followed the project since its planning stages and is looking forward to attending services here.",

      "MADRID -- Six weeks after Spain and Portugal suffered a massive power outage, authorities in Madrid issued an official report Tuesday, saying April\u2019s cascading blackout that left tens of millions disconnected in seconds was caused by technical and planning errors that led to the grid's failure.",
      "Spain's Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen, who manages the nation's energy policy, said in a press conference that small grid failures, concentrated in the south of Spain, led to a chain reaction among larger ones, while completely ruling out questions about a cyberattack.",
      "The minister said several technical causes that contributed to the event, including \u201cthe poor planning\u201d by operators of the grid who didn't find a replacement for one power plant that was supposed to help balance power fluctuations.",
      "The April 28 outage started shortly after 12:30 pm in Spain and lasted through nightfall, disrupting businesses, transit systems, cellular networks, Internet connectivity and other critical infrastructures. In just five seconds, Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 or about 60% of its supply. Portugal, whose grid is connected to Spain's, also went down. Only the countries' island territories were spared.",
      "Power was fully restored by the early hours of the following day.",
      "The government report included analysts from Spain's national security agencies, which concluded, according to the minister, there were no indications of cyber-sabotage by foreign actors.",
      "The only solid information made public shortly after the system went down came from Spain's grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica, which had narrowed down the source of the outage to two separate incidents in southern Spain where substations had failed.",
      "In the weeks following the blackout, citizens and experts were left wondering what triggered the event in a region not known for power outages and igniting a fierce debate about whether Spain's high levels of renewable power had something to do with the grid failing.",
      "Spain is at the forefront of Europe's transition to renewable energy, having generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower and solar. The country is also phasing out its nuclear plants.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed back against such speculation and defended renewables. He asked for patience and said that his government would not \u201cdeviate a single millimeter\u201d from its energy transition plans, which include a goal of generating 81% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.",

      "After years of delay, South Korea has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard international adoptions",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After years of delay, South Korea has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard international adoptions, highlighting a significant policy shift decades after sending tens of thousands of children to the West through an aggressive but poorly regulated adoption system.",
      "The government\u2019s announcement Tuesday came as it faces growing pressure to address widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption program, particularly during a heyday in the 1970s and '80s when the country allowed thousands of children to be adopted every year.",
      "Many adoptees have since discovered that their records were falsified to portray them as abandoned orphans, while others were carelessly removed \u2014 or even outright stolen \u2014 from their birth families.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry and Health and Welfare Ministry, which handles adoption policies, issued a joint statement saying the country submitted the necessary documents to ratify the Hague Adoption Convention to the Dutch Foreign Ministry, the treaty\u2019s depositary.",
      "The treaty, which requires countries to strengthen state oversight and safeguards to ensure international adoptions are legal and ethical, will take effect in South Korea on Oct. 1.",
      "South Korea signed the Hague convention in 2013, but ratification was delayed by more than a decade as the country struggled to bring adoptions under centralized government authority, as required by the treaty, after allowing private agencies to control international child placements for decades.",
      "\u201cGoing forward, intercountry adoptions will be permitted only when no suitable family can be found in his or her state of origin, and only if deemed to serve the child\u2019s best interests through deliberation by the adoption policy committee under the Ministry of Health and Welfare,\u201d the ministries said.",
      "The statement said the ratification was a significant step toward safeguarding children's rights and \u201cestablishing an advanced, internationally compliant intercountry adoption system in Korea, reinforcing the government\u2019s commitment to upholding state responsibility across the entire adoption process.\u201d",
      "A 2023 law also mandates the transfer of all adoption records from private agencies to the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, aiming to centralize processing family search requests from adoptees who have returned to South Korea as adults seeking their roots.",
      "International adoptions from South Korea have plummeted in recent years, with only 58 in 2024, according to government data.",
      "During the 1980s, South Korea sent an average of more than 6,000 children abroad each year, under a previous military government that viewed adoption as a way to reduce mouths to feed and curry favor with Western nations.",
      "Authorities specifically targeted children deemed socially undesirable, including those born to unwed mothers or impoverished families, and granted extensive powers to private adoption agencies to dictate child relinquishments and custody transfers, allowing them to send huge numbers of children abroad quickly.",
      "Much of South Korea\u2019s recent reforms have focused on abuse prevention, including a 2011 law reinstating judicial oversight of foreign adoptions that led to a significant drop in international placements. But officials are at a loss over how to handle the huge numbers of inaccurate or falsified records accumulated over past decades, which have prevented many adoptees from reconnecting with their birth families or obtaining accurate information about their biological origins.",
      "In a landmark report in March, South Korea\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings broadly aligned with a 2024 Associated Press investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), which detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply around 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues related to past adoptions and has so far ignored the commission\u2019s recommendation to issue an apology.",
      "Some adoptees criticized the truth commission\u2019s cautiously worded report, arguing it should have more forcefully acknowledged the government\u2019s complicity and offered more concrete recommendations for reparations for illegal adoption victims.",
      "The commission\u2019s investigation deadline expired in May, after it confirmed human rights violations in just 56 of the 367 complaints filed by adoptees since 2022. The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers will establish a new truth commission through legislation.",

      "LONDON -- British lawmakers voted Tuesday to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales after a lawmaker argued it was cruel to prosecute women for ending a pregnancy.",
      "The House of Commons approved an amendment to a broader crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished under an antiquated law.",
      "Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour member of Parliament who introduced one of the amendments, said the change was needed because police have investigated more than 100 women for suspected illegal abortions over the past five years, including some who suffered natural miscarriages and stillbirths.",
      "\u201cThis piece of legislation will only take women out of the criminal justice system because they are vulnerable and they need our help,\u201d she said. \u201cJust what public interest is this serving? This is not justice, it is cruelty and it has got to end.\u201d",
      "The amendment passed 379-137. The House of Commons will now need to pass the crime bill, which is expected, before it goes to the House of Lords, where it can be delayed but not blocked.",
      "Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions in England, Scotland and Wales up to 24 weeks, and beyond that under special circumstances, such as when the life of the mother is in danger. Abortion in Northern Ireland was decriminalized in 2019.",
      "Changes in the law implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic allow women to receive abortion pills through the mail and terminate their own pregnancies at home within the first 10 weeks.",
      "That has led to a handful of widely publicized cases in which women were prosecuted for illegally obtaining abortion pills and using them to end their own pregnancies after 24 weeks or more.",
      "Anti-abortion groups opposed the measures, arguing it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.",

      "Last month, a jury acquitted Nicola Packer on a charge of unlawfully self-administering poison or a noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage. Packer, who took abortion medicine when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, testified that she did not know she had been pregnant more than 10 weeks.",

      "Thai police say over a dozen foreigners, mostly Australians and British, were arrested for allegedly running an online investment fraud that had duped people out of at least $1.2 million",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thai police said Tuesday over a dozen foreigners, mostly Australians and British, were arrested for allegedly running an online investment fraud that had duped people out of at least 1.9 million Australian dollars (about $1.2 million).",
      "Police raided Monday a rental house in the province of Samut Prakan, neighboring Bangkok, and arrested 13 people, said Jirabhob Bhuridej, chief of the police\u2019s Central Investigation Bureau, at a press conference in the Thai capital.",
      "Jirabhob said the Australian Federal Police (AFP) informed Thai authorities last year of a scam group led by an Australian and a British, and a joint investigation was launched.",
      "The alleged scammers operated out of Thailand to swindle money from victims in Australia and potentially other English-speaking countries through online advertisements and phone calls to invest in long-term bonds with a promise of high returns, Jirabhob said.",
      "Footage showed the men after being arrested in the rental house that was converted into an office. Papers of alleged scam scripts and workflow were taped to their partitioned desks. There were also whiteboards the police said were used for tracking their progress, and clocks on a wall showing time zones across Australia.",
      "Thai police said they staked out the house for several months and saw the men coming and going at times that coincided with working hours in Australia. They said they confiscated a number of phones, computers and other electronic devices allegedly used for the scam.",
      "AFP senior officer Kristie-Lee Cressy said at the Bangkok press conference that at least 14,000 Australians had fallen victim to this scam.",
      "\u201cThe group amassed at least 1.9 million in (Australian dollars) from Australian victims in just the short time it had been operating. Money that we say was stolen from hard-working Australians and not invested as promised,\u201d she said. \u201cShutting down this scam center is a significant win for the communities of Thailand and Australia.\u201d",
      "Australian authorities believe the two leaders of the group had been running scams for many years and operating in several countries, including Indonesia, where they had escaped arrest before being found in Thailand, Jirabhob said.",
      "The group of men arrested in Thailand on Monday includes six British, five Australians, one Canadian and one South African, officials said. They said the suspects denied all wrongdoing, saying that they believed they were working legally for a legitimate investment company.",
      "Immigration officials said they entered Thailand with different kinds of visas, including for retirement and education.",
      "Jirabhob said they were initially charged with racketeering and working in Thailand without a permit. He said further investigation could lead to more serious charges, including fraud and involvement in a transnational organized crime.",
      "Australian police officer Cressy said Australia suffered an estimated damage of 4.45 billion Australian dollars ($2.9 billion) from online scams in the past four years.",
      "A U.N. report in April said transnational organized crime groups in East and Southeast Asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities.",

      "If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a m...",
      "BANGKOK -- If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain.",
      "Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program. Israeli officials have also suggested that there are other options for it to attack Fordo as it seeks to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "But aside from a commando attack on the ground or a nuclear strike, the bunker buster bomb seems the most likely option.",
      "\u201cBunker buster\u201d is a broad term used to describe bombs that are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding. In this case, it refers to the latest GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb in the American arsenal. The roughly 30,000 pound (13,600 kilogram) precision-guided bomb is designed to attack deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels, according to the U.S. Air Force.",
      "It's believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.",
      "The bomb carries a conventional warhead, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, raising the possibility that nuclear material could be released into the area if the GBU-57 A/B were used to hit the facility. However, Israeli strikes at another Iranian nuclear site, Natanz, on a centrifuge site have caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area, the IAEA has said.",
      "Fordo is Iran's second nuclear enrichment facility after Natanz, its main facility. So far, Israeli strikes aren\u2019t known to have damaged Natanz\u2019s underground enrichment hall, nor have the Israelis targeted tunnels the Iranians are digging nearby.",
      "Fordo is smaller than Natanz, and is built into the side of a mountain near the city of Qom, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Tehran. Construction is believed to have started around 2006 and it became first operational in 2009 \u2014 the same year Tehran publicly acknowledged its existence.",
      "In addition to being an estimated 80 meters (260 feet) under rock and soil, the site is reportedly protected by Iranian and Russian surface-to-air missile systems. Those air defenses, however, likely have already been struck in the Israeli campaign.",
      "Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the goal of attacking Iran was to eliminate its missile and nuclear program, which he described as an existential threat to Israel, and officials have said Fordo was part of that plan.",
      "\"This entire operation ... really has to be completed with the elimination of Fordo,\u201d Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News on Friday.",
      "In theory, the GBU-57 A/B could be dropped by any bomber capable of carrying the weight, but at the moment the U.S. has only configured and programed its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to deliver the bomb, according to the Air Force.",
      "The B-2 is only flown by the Air Force, and is produced by Northrop Grumman.",
      "According to the manufacturer, the B-2 can carry a payload of 40,000 pounds (18,000 kilograms) but the U.S. Air Force has said it has successfully tested the B-2 loaded with two GBU-57 A/B bunker busters \u2014 a total weight of some 60,000 pounds (27,200 kilograms).",
      "The strategic long-range heavy bomber has a range of about 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) without refueling and 11,500 miles (18,500 kilometers) with one refueling, and can reach any point in the world within hours, according to Northrop Grumman.",
      "Whether the U.S. would get involved is another matter.",
      "At the G7 meeting in Canada, Trump was asked what it would take for Washington to become involved militarily and he said: \u201cI don't want to talk about that.\u201d",
      "In a weekend interview with ABC News, Israeli Ambassador Leiter was asked about the possibility of the U.S. helping attack Fordo and he emphasized Israel has only asked the U.S. for defensive help.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of contingencies ... which will enable us to deal with Fordo,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNot everything is a matter of, you know, taking to the skies and bombing from afar.\"",

      "The Czech coalition government has faced a parliamentary no-confidence vote over a bitcoin-related scandal",
      "PRAGUE -- The Czech coalition government on Tuesday faced a parliamentary no-confidence vote over a bitcoin-related scandal.",
      "The main opposition centrist ANO (YES) movement led by populist billionaire Andrej Babi\u0161 requested the vote after the Justice Ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($47 million) earlier this year.",
      "The three opposition parties, including ANO, the anti-migrant Freedom and Direct Democracy movement and the liberal Pirates party, are unlikely to oust the four-party coalition government led by conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala, which has a majority in the lower house of Parliament.",
      "Justice Minister Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from his post over the issue on May 30 and was replaced by Eva Decroix on June 10.",
      "Bla\u017eek said he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the coalition to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said he appreciated his resignation and believed Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Bla\u017eek was a close ally of Fiala in the government and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. The new minister is from the same party.",
      "Decroix said she will order an independent probe into the ministry\u2019s activities in the case.",
      "The scandal focues on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes, while it was not clear why he did it.",
      "The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn\u2019t clear where the bitcoins originated, and demanded the resignation of the entire government. The issue has been investigated by the national police\u2019s organized crime unit.",
      "Czech lawmakers were debating the no-confidence motion, the fourth since the government took over after a 2021 election, with a vote expected late Tuesday or Wednesday.",
      "The scandal comes just months before the Oct 3-4 parliamentary election. Babi\u0161 is predicted to win the vote.",

      "As Israel pounds Iran with airstrikes targeting military facilities and its nuclear sites, officials in Tehran have proposed a variety of steps the Islamic Republic could take outside of launching retaliatory missile barrages",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As Israel pounds Iran with airstrikes targeting military facilities and its nuclear sites, officials in Tehran have proposed a variety of steps the Islamic Republic could take outside of launching retaliatory missile barrages.",
      "Those proposals mirror those previously floated by Iran in confrontations with either Israel or the United States in that last few decades. They included disrupting maritime shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, potentially leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and other attacks by militants.",
      "Here's a look at what those options could mean \u2014 both to Iran and the wider Middle East.",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf, through which some 20% of all oil traded globally passes.",
      "The strait is in the territorial waters of Iran and Oman, which at its narrowest point is just 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide. The width of the shipping lane in either direction is only 3 kilometers (2 miles). Anything affecting it ripples through global energy markets, potentially raising the price of crude oil. That then trickles down to consumers through what they pay for gasoline and other oil products.",
      "There has been a wave of attacks on ships attributed to Iran since 2019, following President Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposing crushing sanctions on Tehran.",
      "U.S. forces routinely travel through the strait, despite sometimes-tense encounters with Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet conducts those operations, known as freedom of navigation missions, to ensure the waterway remains open to business. Iran views those passages as challenging its sovereignty \u2014 as if it operated off the coast of the U.S.",
      "Since the Israeli attacks began, Iranian officials have repeatedly raised blocking the strait \u2014 which likely would draw an immediate American response.",
      "Experts fear Tehran could respond to the strike by deciding to fully end its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, abandon the the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rush toward a bomb.",
      "As a member of the treaty, Iran is obligated to explain the any radioactive traces outside of declared sites and to provide assurances that they are not being used as part of a nuclear weapons program. Iran insists its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed state to enrich uranium up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA assess Iran hasn't had an organized military nuclear program since 2003.",
      "There is precedence for the concern. North Korea said it withdrew from the treaty in 2003 and tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.",
      "However, again, if Iran withdrew from the treaty, it could draw the U.S. into the fight, something Tehran so far has been seeking to avoid.",
      "Iran could encourage more asymmetric attacks, targeting Jewish tourists, synagogues or Israeli diplomatic missions as it has done in the past. However, it's been a rough few years for those forces.",
      "Iran\u2019s allies, the self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d have been severely hurt by ongoing Israeli attacks since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, particularly Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Iran has long used those groups as both an asymmetrical way to attack Israel and as a shield against a direct assault.",
      "Iraqi groups backed by Iran so far haven't gotten involved, leaving just Yemen's Houthi rebels as the only member of the axis to launch attacks on Israel since its campaign against Iran began.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s coal industry is facing mounting pressure as China and India, its biggest customers, cut back on imports of the heavily polluting fossil fuel",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Indonesia\u2019s coal industry is facing mounting pressure and should diversify as China and India, its biggest customers, cut back on imports of the heavily polluting fossil fuel, according to a report from a Jakarta-based energy thinktank, Energy Shift.",
      "The report released Tuesday says that the industry, which accounts for about 3.6% of Indonesia's economic activity and employs tens of thousands of people, needs to shift toward cleaner energy now or risk being forced into a costly transition later.",
      "Indonesia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of coal, which is central to its economy, generating tax revenues and jobs. So the expected long-term decline in demand presents a unique challenge for the country of some 280 million. Indonesia\u2019s coal production is still rising, hitting a record 836 million tons in 2024, nearly 8% more than the year before.",
      "The industry also relies heavily on just a few buyers, with China and India buying nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's coal exports in 2023.",
      "China still relies on coal for more than half its electricity generation. It accounted for 41% of global coal imports in 2024, or nearly 543 million tons. But more than 75% of the growth in demand last year was met by clean energy.",
      "India\u2019s coal imports fell 8.4% to 183.42 million metric tons from April to December 2024, down from 200.19 million metric tons in the same period a year earlier, government data shows. The drop is part of India\u2019s push to reduce import dependence by ramping up domestic coal production. Imports for industries like cement, steel and aluminum that buy coal at market rates declined 12% while imports for thermal power plants fell even more sharply, down 29.8%.",
      "Indonesia's coal exports fell to a three-year low in January-April of this year, a shift that may signal a longer term decline, experts say.",
      "\u201cThese are signs that Indonesian coal miners have to start taking seriously as well,\u201d said Hazel Ilango of the Energy Shift Institute.",
      "There are other risks too. Most Indonesian coal companies are tightly controlled by insiders \u2014 owners, executives, and board members \u2014 who hold about 75% of company shares on average, according to the report. Regulations such as domestic supply rules and high royalties also limit profits, while access to global financing remains restricted.",
      "The private sector and investors are generally uninterested in long-term transition plans and are more focused on immediate profits, while government policies remain inconsistent, said Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute.",
      "Experts say that the country\u2019s coal policy is riddled with contradictions. It has pledged to cut emissions and transition to clean energy, but it continues to expand coal production and approve new plants. Domestic subsidies keep coal cheap, but abrupt export bans have disrupted global markets. Meanwhile, the state utility plans to retire coal plants early under a $20 billion transition deal \u2014 even as new ones tied to the industry are still being built.",
      "As major coal importers like China and India cut imports to boost their energy security, Indonesia\u2019s coal sector needs to plan ahead, said Jordan Lee, an energy transition expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta.",
      "\u201cThe reason I say that is basically if you look at what happened with some big oil companies that have tried something similar, we have seen the market not respond too positively,\u201d he said.",

      "Investigators in India are studying the black boxes of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner after recovering them from the aircraft wreckage to ascertain the cause of last week\u2019s plane crash that left at least 270 people dead",
      "NEW DELHI -- Investigators in India are studying the black boxes of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner after recovering them from the aircraft wreckage to ascertain the cause of last week\u2019s plane crash that left at least 270 people dead.",
      "The black boxes will provide cockpit conversations and data related to the plane's engine and control settings to investigators and help them in determining the cause of the crash.",
      "The London-bound Air India aircraft, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, crashed on a medical college hostel soon after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad. Only one passenger survived the crash, while 241 people on board and 29 on the ground were killed in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades.",
      "Experts from India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau are probing the crash with assistance from the U.K., the U.S. and officials from Boeing.",
      "Amit Singh, a former pilot and an aviation expert, said the recovery of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, or black boxes, are crucial to piece together the sequence of events.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder records pilots\u2019 conversation, emergency alarms and any distress signal made before a crash. The plane\u2019s digital flight data recorder stores information related to engine and control settings. Both devices are designed to survive a crash.",
      "\u201cThe data will reveal everything,\u201d Singh said, adding that the technical details could be corroborated by the cockpit voice recorder that would help investigators know of any communication between air traffic control and the pilots.",
      "India\u2019s aviation regulatory body has said the aircraft made a mayday call before the crash.",
      "Singh said the investigating authorities will scan CCTV footage of the nearby area and speak with witnesses to get to the root cause of the crash.",
      "Additionally, Singh said, the investigators will also study the pilot training records, total load of the aircraft, thrust issues related to the plane's engine, as well as its worthiness in terms of past performances and any previously reported issues.",
      "Aurobindo Handa, former director general of India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, said the investigators across the world follow a standard UN-prescribed Manual of Accident Investigation, also called \u201cDOC 9756,\u201d which outlines detailed procedures to arrive at the most probable cause of a crash.",
      "Handa said the investigation into last week's crash would likely be a long process as the aircraft was badly charred. He added that ascertaining the condition of the black boxes recovered from the crash site was vital as the heat generated from the crash could be possibly higher than the bearable threshold of the device.",
      "The Indian government has set up a separate, high-level committee to examine the causes leading to the crash and formulate procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future. The committee is expected to file a preliminary report within three months.",
      "Authorities have also begun inspecting and carrying out additional maintenance and checks of Air India\u2019s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to prevent any future incident. Air India has 33 Dreamliners in its fleet.",
      "The plane that crashed was 12 years old. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft. There are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea will send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to support reconstruction work in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, a top Russian official said Tuesday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the nations.",
      "North Korea has already supplied thousands of combat troops and a vast amount of conventional weapons to back Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. In April, Pyongyang and Moscow said that their soldiers fought together to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, though Ukraine has insisted it still has troops present there.",
      "Wrapping up a one-day visit to Pyongyang, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers to clear mines in the Kursk region and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure there, according to Russia's state news agency, Tass.",
      "Another Russian state news agency, RIA Novosti, carried a similar report.",
      "\u201cFollowing the expulsion of invaders from Russian soil, we\u2019ve agreed to continue our constructive cooperation, with the Korean side providing assistance in the restoration of the Kursk region,\u201d Shoigu said, according to RIA Novosti. \"This is a kind of brotherly aid being sent by the Korean people and their leader, Kim Jong Un, to our country.\u201d",
      "Shoigu said that Moscow and Pyongyang agreed to erect memorials in both countries in honor of North Korean soldiers who died while fighting in the Kursk region, according to Tass and RIA Novosti.",
      "North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim confirmed the contents of North Korea\u2019s cooperation with Russia with regard to Kursk\u2019s current situation but didn't mention the dispatch of army construction workers and deminers cited by Russian media.",
      "KCNA quoted Kim as expressing his resolve to \u201cinvariably and unconditionally support\u201d what he called Russian efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Kim has previously made similar comments in support of Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "KCNA also said that Kim and Shoigu approved some plans for \u201cconveying long the heroic feats displayed by\u201d North Korean troops in operations to liberate the Kursk area, an apparent reference to the memorial construction plan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over what it described as ongoing illicit cooperation between North Korea and Russia, stressing that the acceptance and employment of North Korean workers abroad constitute a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.",
      "\u201cOur government has been closely monitoring developments related to the cooperation between Russia and North Korea in cooperation with international partners,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
      "North Korea and Russia have never disclosed how many North Korean troops have been sent to Russia or how many of them were killed. But according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukraine assessments, about 15,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia. South Korea's spy agency said in April that about 600 North Korean soldiers died on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts.",
      "The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised worries among the U.S., South Korea and their partners that Russian President Vladimir Putin may in return provide Kim with much-needed sophisticated technologies that can help advance his nuclear and missile programs.",
      "The two countries, both in confrontations with the U.S. and its allies, have sharply grown closer to each other in recent years. In 2024, Kim and Putin signed a landmark defense treaty that requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked.",
      "It was Shoigu\u2019s third visit to North Korea in about three months. The two countries have exchanged high-level visits in past years, with Kim travelling to Russia in 2023 and Putin to North Korea in 2024. Many observers say Kim could soon visit Russia again for another summit with Putin.",
      "In its closed-door briefing to lawmakers on April 30, South Korea's National Intelligence Service said that Russia had given North Korea air defense missiles, electronic warfare equipment, drones and technology for spy satellite launches. The NIS said that 15,000 North Korean laborers have also been sent to Russia under bilateral industrial cooperation programs, according to lawmakers who attended the briefing.",

      "Exports fell 1.7% year-on-year, which was less than the decline analysts had forecast, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday. Imports sank 7.7%, reflecting weakening domestic demand and worse than the 2% fall recorded in April.",
      "The trade deficit in May was 637.6 billion yen, or $4.4 billion.",

      "In Gaza and Africa, U.S. contracting firms led by former American intelligence and military officers are taking on aid delivery in conflict zones",
      "ON A PLANE OVER UPPER NILE STATE, South Sudan -- Swooping low over the banks of a Nile River tributary, an aid flight run by retired American military officers released a stream of food-stuffed sacks over a town emptied by fighting in South Sudan, a country wracked by conflict.",
      "Last week's air drop was the latest in a controversial development \u2014 private contracting firms led by former U.S. intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones, in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.",
      "The moves are roiling the global aid community, which warns of a more militarized, politicized and profit-seeking trend that could allow governments or combatants to use life-saving aid to control hungry civilian populations and advance war aims.",
      "In South Sudan and Gaza, two for-profit U.S. companies led by American national security veterans are delivering aid in operations backed by the South Sudanese and Israeli governments.",
      "The American contractors say they're putting their security, logistics and intelligence skills to work in relief operations. Fogbow, the U.S. company that carried out last week's air drops over South Sudan, says it aims to be a \u201chumanitarian\u201d force.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked for careers, collectively, in conflict zones. And we know how to essentially make very difficult situations work,\u201d said Fogbow President Michael Mulroy, a retired CIA officer and former senior defense official in the first Trump administration, speaking on the airport tarmac in Juba, South Sudan's capital.",
      "But the U.N. and many leading non-profit groups say U.S. contracting firms are stepping into aid distribution with little transparency or humanitarian experience, and, crucially, without commitment to humanitarian principles of neutrality and operational independence in war zones.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years of successes and failures is there\u2019s a difference between a logistics operation and a security operation, and a humanitarian operation,\u201d said Scott Paul, a director at Oxfam America.",
      "\u201c\u2018Truck and chuck\u2019 doesn\u2019t help people,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt puts people at risk.\u201d",
      "Fogbow took journalists up in a cargo plane to watch their team drop 16 tons of beans, corn and salt for South Sudan's Upper Nile state town of Nasir.",
      "Residents fled homes there after fighting erupted in March between the government and opposition groups.",
      "Mulroy acknowledged the controversy over Fogbow's aid drops, which he said were paid for by the South Sudanese government.",
      "But, he maintained: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to replace any entity\u201d in aid work.",
      "Fogbow was in the spotlight last year for its proposal to use barges to bring aid to Gaza, where Israeli restrictions were blocking overland deliveries. The United States focused instead on a U.S. military effort to land aid via a temporary pier.",
      "Since then, Fogbow has carried out aid drops in Sudan and South Sudan, east African nations where wars have created some of the world's gravest humanitarian crises.",
      "Fogbow says ex-humanitarian officials are also involved, including former U.N. World Food Program head David Beasley, who is a senior adviser.",
      "Operating in Gaza, meanwhile, Safe Reach Solutions, led by a former CIA officer and other retired U.S. security officers, has partnered with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed nonprofit that Israel says is the linchpin of a new aid system to wrest control from the U.N., which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Starting in late May, the American-led operation in Gaza has distributed food at fixed sites in southern Gaza, in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated plan to use aid to concentrate the territory's more than 2 million people in the south, freeing Israel to fight Hamas elsewhere. Aid workers fear it's a step toward another of Netanyahu\u2019s public goals, removing Palestinians from Gaza in \u201cvoluntary\u201d migrations.",
      "Since then, several hundred Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in near daily shootings as they tried to reach aid sites, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Witnesses say Israeli troops regularly fire heavy barrages toward the crowds in an attempt to control them.",
      "The Israeli military has denied firing on civilians. It says it fired warning shots in several instances, and fired directly at a few \u201csuspects\u201d who ignored warnings and approached its forces.",
      "It\u2019s unclear who is funding the new operation in Gaza. No donor has come forward, and the U.S. says it\u2019s not funding it.",
      "In response to criticism over its Gaza aid deliveries, Safe Reach Solutions said it has former aid workers on its team with \u201cdecades of experience in the world\u2019s most complex environments\u201d who bring \"expertise to the table, along with logisticians and other experts.\u201c",
      "Last week's air drop over South Sudan went without incident, despite fighting nearby. A white cross marked the drop zone. Only a few people could be seen. Fogbow contractors said there were more newly returned townspeople on previous drops.",
      "Fogbow acknowledges glitches in mastering aid drops, including one last year in Sudan\u2019s South Kordofan region that ended up with too-thinly-wrapped grain sacks split open on the ground.",
      "After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan has struggled to emerge from a civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. Rights groups say its government is one of the world\u2019s most corrupt, and until now has invested little in quelling the dire humanitarian crisis.",
      "South Sudan said it engaged Fogbow for air drops partly because of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cuts in U.S. Agency for International Development funding. Humanitarian Minister Albino Akol Atak said the drops will expand to help people in need throughout the country.",
      "But two South Sudanese groups question the government's motives.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a humanitarian space being abused by military actors ... under the cover of a food drop,\" said Edmund Yakani, head of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a local civil society group.",
      "Asked about suspicions the aid drops were helping South Sudan's military aims, Fogbow's Mulroy said the group has worked with the U.N. World Food Program to make sure \u201cthis aid is going to civilians.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it wasn't going to civilians, we would hope that we would get that feedback, and we would cease and desist,\u201d Mulroy said.",
      "In a statement, WFP country director Mary-Ellen McGroarty said: \u201cWFP is not involved in the planning, targeting or distribution of food air-dropped\u201d by Fogbow on behalf of South Sudan's government, citing humanitarian principles.",
      "Longtime humanitarian leaders and analysts are troubled by what they see as a teaming up of warring governments and for-profit contractors in aid distribution.",
      "When one side in a conflict decides where and how aid is handed out, and who gets it, \u201cit will always result in some communities getting preferential treatment,\u201d said Jan Egeland, executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council.",
      "Sometimes, that set-up will advance strategic aims, as with Netanyahu's plans to move Gaza's civilians south, Egeland said.",
      "The involvement of soldiers and security workers, he added, can make it too \u201cintimidating\u201d for some in need to even try to get aid.",
      "Until now, Western donors always understood those risks, Egeland said. But pointing to the Trump administration's backing of the new aid system in Gaza, he asked: \u201cWhy does the U.S. ... want to support what they have resisted with every other war zone for two generations?\u201d",
      "Mark Millar, who has advised the U.N. and Britain on humanitarian matters in South Sudan and elsewhere, said involving private military contractors risks undermining the distinction between humanitarian assistance and armed conflict.",
      "Private military contractors \u201chave even less sympathy for a humanitarian perspective that complicates their business-driven model,\" he said. \u201cAnd once let loose, they seem to be even less accountable.\u201d",

      "Government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal, which calls for members of the Sackler family who own the company to pay up to $7 billion over 15 years.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "The request of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane comes about a year after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper that the earlier iteration would have protected members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "Under the reworked plan hammered out with lawyers for state and local governments and others, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payouts would not begin until after a hearing scheduled for Nov. 10, during which Lane is to be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s Senate on Tuesday night approved a labor bill that is expected to grant workers more overtime pay while making it harder for companies to hire employees on short-term contracts.",
      "The bill\u2019s approval comes as tensions have been increasing between the Senate and President Gustavo Petro over reforms to the economy and health system that have polarized the nation\u2019s politics and tested the separation of powers in Colombia\u2019s fragile democracy.",
      "Petro has repeatedly accused Congress of blocking his reforms and last week issued a decree that called on Colombia\u2019s elections agency, the National Registrar, to organize a referendum on labor laws.",
      "The agency said Tuesday it would wait for Colombian courts to decide if it was legal for it to organize the referendum, because the Senate had voted against the referendum last month.",
      "Petro has threatened to change Colombia\u2019s constitution, by calling for a constituent assembly, if his request for a referendum on labor laws is not granted, and in a post on X Tuesday, said that those who did not approve the referendum were committing \u201ctreason.\"",
      "Opposition leaders have accused the president of developing an authoritarian streak, as he tries to override decisions made by Congress.",
      "The labor bill approved by Colombia\u2019s Senate on Tuesday includes many of the changes to Colombia's labor laws proposed by Petro's party, the Historical Pact. It increases surcharges paid to employees who work Sundays and also makes companies pay more for late evening shifts, which is likely to apply to many retailers, restaurants and hotels.",
      "The bill also says delivery apps must formally hire delivery workers as freelancers or as full-time employees and help to pay for their health insurance.",
      "Business associations in Colombia oppose the changes, arguing they will raise the cost of employing people and could ultimately increase unemployment.",
      "Currently, 56% of Colombian workers labor with no contracts, in what is known as the informal economy. Economists expect the reforms to push more people into informality, while supporters of the bill argue they are just pushing for the restoration of rights workers had in the early 1990s, before Colombia began to make labor laws more flexible.",
      "The Senate and House of Representatives must now reconcile the differences in the bills each chamber drafted and then agree on a final version of the bill.",
      "Petro wrote in a message on X that he will continue to push for the referendum until legislators from both chambers have voted on a final bill.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and budget bill would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after factoring in other economic effects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts package would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after including other economic effects, according to a fuller analysis of the House-passed measure released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The report, produced by the nonpartisan CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, factors in expected debt service costs and finds that the bill would increase interest rates and boost interest payments on the baseline projection of federal debt by $441 billion.",
      "The analysis comes at a crucial moment as Trump is pushing the GOP-led Congress to act on what he calls his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\" It passed the House last month on a party-line vote, and now faces revisions in the Senate. Vice President JD Vance urged Senate Republicans during a private lunch meeting Tuesday to send the final package to the president's desk.",
      "\u201cWe're excited to get this bill out,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune afterward.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report uses dynamic analysis by estimating the budgetary impact of the tax bill by considering how changes in the economy might affect revenues and spending. This is in contrast to static scoring, which presumes all other economic factors stay constant.",
      "The CBO released its static scoring analysis earlier this month, estimating that Trump\u2019s bill would unleash trillions in tax cuts and slash spending, but also increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance.",
      "Republicans have repeatedly argued that a more dynamic scoring model would more accurately show how cutting taxes would spur economic growth \u2014 essentially overcoming any lost revenue to the federal government.",
      "But the larger deficit numbers in the new analysis gave Democrats, who are unified against the big bill, fresh arguments for challenging the GOP position that the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves.",
      "\u201cThe Republican claim that this bill does not add to the debt or deficit is laughable, and the proof is in the numbers,\" said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "\u201cThe cost of these tax giveaways for billionaires, even when considering economic growth, will add even more to the debt than we previously expected,\u201d he said.",
      "Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Tuesday on social media that considering the new dynamic analysis, \u201cIt\u2019s not only not paying for all of itself, it\u2019s not paying for any of itself.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO, saying the organization isn\u2019t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create.",
      "At the Capitol, Mehmet Oz, who heads up the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and joined Vance at the GOP Senate lunch, challenged CBO's findings when asked about its estimate that the bill would leave 10.9 million more people without health care, largely from new work requirements.",
      "\u201cWhat will an American do if they\u2019re given the option of trying to get a job or an education or volunteering their community \u2014 having some engagement \u2014 or losing their Medicaid insurance coverage?\u201d Oz asked. \u201cI have more confidence in the American people than has been given to them by some of these analyzing organizations.\u201d",
      "Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee unveiled their proposal Monday for deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making Trump\u2019s tax breaks more permanent in their draft for the big bill.",
      "The Senate's version of the package also enhances Trump\u2019s proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.",
      "The proposals from Senate Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.",
      "Bessent said Tuesday that the Senate Republican proposal for the tax cuts bill \u201cwill deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump\u2019s desk,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "While the House-passed bill exempted parents with dependents from the new Medicaid work requirements, the Senate\u2019s version broadened the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.",
      "The work requirements \u201cdemonstrate that you are trying your hardest to help this country be greater,\u201d Oz said. \u201cBy doing that, you earn the right to be on Medicaid.\u201d",
      "The CBO separately released another analysis on the tax bill last week, including a look at how the measure would affect households based on income distribution. It estimates the bill would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A federal court on Tuesday granted a request by former Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner to serve a six-year prison sentence for corruption at her home in Buenos Aires.",
      "Judges ruled that Fern\u00e1ndez, 72, can serve time in the apartment where she lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, citing her age and security reasons. Fern\u00e1ndez was the victim of an attempted assassination three years ago.",
      "In the ruling, obtained by The Associated Press, the court said Fern\u00e1ndez \u201cmust remain at the registered address, an obligation that she may not break except in exceptional situations.\"",
      "The court also ordered Fern\u00e1ndez be placed under the watch of an electronic surveillance device to monitor her movements.",
      "Last week, Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s sentence in a ruling that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The ruling against Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The ruling barred Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative election just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "On Tuesday, the court dismissed prosecutors' request that Fern\u00e1ndez serve time behind bars. Judges said that the physical integrity of the political leader \u201cwould become complex in a situation of prison confinement in coexistence with any type of prison population.\u201d",
      "Seeking to serve the sentence at home, the former president had argued that she is more than 70 years old \u2014 an extenuating circumstance taken into account by the justice system to grant the privilege.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism \u2014 after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner. She rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office from 2007\u20132015, Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. Her governments funded unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for major budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 of corruption in a case that centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a project that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claimed that her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.",

      "Brazil has auctioned off several land and offshore potential oil sites near the Amazon River, aiming to expand production in untapped regions despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups",
      "BRASILANDIA, Brazil -- BRASILANDIA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Brazil auctioned off several land and offshore potential oil sites near the Amazon River on Tuesday as it aims to expand production in untapped regions despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups.",
      "The event came months before Brazil is to host the U.N.\u2019s first climate talks held in the Amazon. The protesters outside Tuesday's venue warned of potential risks that oil drilling poses to sensitive ecosystems and Indigenous communities in the Amazon.",
      "A luxury Rio de Janeiro hotel hosted the auction conducted by the National Oil Agency. Most of the 172 oil blocks for sale are located in areas with no current production, such as 47 offshore locations close to the mouth of the Amazon River and two sites inland in the Amazon near Indigenous territories.",
      "Nineteen offshore blocks were awarded to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Petrobras and CNPC. The oil companies see the area as highly promising because it shares geological characteristics with Guyana, where some of the largest offshore oil discoveries of the 21st century have been made.",
      "This region is considered to have high potential risk due to strong currents and the proximity to the Amazon seashore.",
      "Under public pressure from President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, known as IBAMA, approved an emergency plan allowing state-run Petrobras to conduct exploratory drilling in a block near the mouth of the Amazon River, the last step to grant an environmental license.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable and concerning that blocks are being acquired in a basin that has not yet received environmental licensing,\u201d Nicole Oliveira, executive director of the environmental nonprofit Arayara, which tried to block the auction in court.",
      "\u201cThis is an irresponsible move by the National Oil Agency and a very risky one for the companies involved,\" Oliveira told The Associated Press. \"We will continue litigating to prevent the contracts from being signed and the blocks from being explored.\u201d",
      "The auction wrapped up with only 34 oil blocks awarded.",
      "Brazil\u00b4s oil agency noted that the signing bonuses \u2014 one-time payments made by the winning companies \u2014 totaled $180 million, a record for auctions of this kind. An agency representative said the highest premium was for a block located near the mouth of the Amazon River, which drew a nearly 3,000% markup.",
      "Oliveira took part in a peaceful protest that gathered about 200 people outside the auction site, from environmentalists to Indigenous leaders.",
      "\u201cWe came to Rio to repudiate the auction,\u201d said Giovane Tapura of the Manoki, an Amazon tribe. \u201cWe would have liked to be consulted and to see studies on how the oil drilling could affect us. None of this has been done.\u201d",
      "In a recorded opening statement at the start of the event, Brazil\u2019s National Oil Agency said the auctions are part of the country\u2019s energy diversification strategy aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy and that contracts signed with the winning companies include measures to reduce carbon intensity in production activities, as well as mandatory investments in energy transition projects.",
      "Brazil has increased crude oil production, which became the country\u2019s top export for the first time last year, surpassing soybeans.",
      "The auction is part of the federal government's goal to maintain and even expand output beyond 2030, when production from current oil blocks under exploration is expected to decline. Brazil gets most of its electricity from hydropower and other green energies.",
      "The U.N. climate talks will be held in the city of Belem, close to the mouth of the Amazon. Critics say it's a contradiction that Brazil's president is pushing for increased fossil fuel production while trying to cast himself as an environmental champion.",
      "Claudio Angelo, head of international policy at Climate Observatory, a coalition of 133 environmental, civil society and academic organizations, told reporters ahead of the auction that Brazil is both undermining its own standing ahead of the climate talks and undermining climate protection efforts.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that administration officials deem as promoting \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d under a new initiative announced Tuesday.",
      "Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will aim to review select drugs in one to two months. FDA's long-standing accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Regular drug reviews take about 10 months.",
      "Since arriving at the FDA in April, Makary has repeatedly told FDA staff they need to \u201cchallenge assumptions\u201d and rethink procedures. In a medical journal commentary published last week, Makary suggested the agency could conduct \u201crapid or instant reviews,\" pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed.",
      "For the new program, the FDA will issue a limited number of \u201cnational priority vouchers\u201d to companies \u201caligned with U.S. national priorities,\u201d the agency said in a statement. The special designation will give the selected companies access to extra FDA communications, streamlined staff reviews and the ability to submit much of their product information in advance.",
      "Speeding up drug approvals has long been a priority of the pharmaceutical industry, which has successfully lobbied Congress to create a variety of special programs and pathways for faster reviews.",
      "Many aspects of the plan announced Tuesday overlap with older programs. But the broad criteria for receiving a voucher will give FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies can benefit from the fastest reviews.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public,\u201d Makary said in a statement.",
      "Makary previously said the FDA should be willing to ease its scientific requirements for certain drugs, for instance, by not always requiring randomized studies in which patients are tracked over time to track safety and effectiveness. Such trials are generally considered the gold standard of medical research, though the FDA has increasingly been willing to accept smaller, less-definitive studies for rare or life-threatening diseases.",
      "In several recent cases, the FDA has faced criticism for approving drugs based on preliminary data that didn't ultimately show benefits for patients.",
      "The push to rapidly accelerated drug approvals is the opposite approach that Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have taken on vaccines.",
      "Promising a \u201creturn to gold-standard science,\u201d Kennedy previously announced that all new vaccines would have to be compared to placebo, or a dummy shot, to win approval. Kennedy and Makary also have announced a stricter policy on seasonal updates to COVID-19 shots, saying they will have to undergo new testing before they can be approved for use in healthy children and most adults.",

      "He indicated in an interview last month with NBC that he would be open to pushing back the deadline again.",
      "If announced, it would be the third time Trump has extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when the ban approved by Congress \u2014 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 took effect. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",

FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",
      "The company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.",
      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Retail sales fell sharply in May as consumers pulled back after a sharp increase in spending in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports.",
      "Sales at retail stores and restaurants dropped 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, after a decline of 0.1% in April. The figure was pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3%.",
      "The sales drop comes after sharp declines in consumer confidence this year. Still, inflation has cooled steadily and unemployment remains low, which could fuel steady spending in the coming months, as the economy has remained mostly solid.",
      "Sales dropped 2.7% last month at home and garden centers, 0.6% at electronics and appliance stores, and 0.7% at grocery stores. There were some bright spots: Sales rose 0.9% at online retailers, 0.8% at clothing stores, and 1.2% at furniture stores.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea will send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to support reconstruction work in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, a top Russian official said Tuesday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the nations.",
      "North Korea has already supplied thousands of combat troops and a vast amount of conventional weapons to back Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. In April, Pyongyang and Moscow said that their soldiers fought together to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, though Ukraine has insisted it still has troops present there.",
      "Wrapping up a one-day visit to Pyongyang, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers to clear mines in the Kursk region and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure there, according to Russia's state news agency, Tass.",
      "Another Russian state news agency, RIA Novosti, carried a similar report.",
      "\u201cFollowing the expulsion of invaders from Russian soil, we\u2019ve agreed to continue our constructive cooperation, with the Korean side providing assistance in the restoration of the Kursk region,\u201d Shoigu said, according to RIA Novosti. \"This is a kind of brotherly aid being sent by the Korean people and their leader, Kim Jong Un, to our country.\u201d",
      "Shoigu said that Moscow and Pyongyang agreed to erect memorials in both countries in honor of North Korean soldiers who died while fighting in the Kursk region, according to Tass and RIA Novosti.",
      "North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim confirmed the contents of North Korea\u2019s cooperation with Russia with regard to Kursk\u2019s current situation but didn't mention the dispatch of army construction workers and deminers cited by Russian media.",
      "KCNA quoted Kim as expressing his resolve to \u201cinvariably and unconditionally support\u201d what he called Russian efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Kim has previously made similar comments in support of Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "KCNA also said that Kim and Shoigu approved some plans for \u201cconveying long the heroic feats displayed by\u201d North Korean troops in operations to liberate the Kursk area, an apparent reference to the memorial construction plan.",
      "North Korea and Russia have never disclosed how many North Korean troops have been sent to Russia or how many of them were killed. But according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukraine assessments, about 15,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia. South Korea's spy agency said in April that about 600 North Korean soldiers died on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts.",

      "The two countries, both in confrontations with the U.S. and its allies, have sharply grown closer to each other in recent years. In 2024, Kim and Putin signed a landmark defense treaty that requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked.",
      "It was Shoigu\u2019s third visit to North Korea in about three months. The two countries have exchanged high-level visits in past years, with Kim travelling to Russia in 2023 and Putin to North Korea in 2024. Many observers say Kim could soon visit Russia again for another summit with Putin.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Thursday expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over what it described as ongoing illicit cooperation between North Korea and Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency that Russia\u2019s continued use of North Korean workers and soldiers were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and stated that Pyongyang was \u201cnow relying on Russia to provide it with desperately needed funds in exchange for labor and soldier for hire schemes.\" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also expressed deep concern, saying advancing cooperation between Russia and North Korea threatens to jeopardize global security.",
      "On Wednesday, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan flew fighter jets for a trilateral aerial training off South Korea's southern Jeju island as part of their efforts to boost security cooperation to cope with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats, according to the South Korean air force.",
      "In South Korea, there are worries that the 2024 North Korea-Russia defense treaty would lead to Russia intervening in a potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Experts say North Korea's military would also obtain valuable combat experiences from the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "South Korea, the U.S. and others have stated the ongoing North Korean-Russia military cooperation involve elements that constitute clear violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions, which ban any weapons transfer involving North Korea and required member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans.",

      "LeBron James may be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there\u2019s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 LeBron James may be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there\u2019s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers superstar plans to return for his 23rd NBA season, which would make him the first player in league history to reach that milestone. But before he steps back on the court, James is prioritizing rest and recovery after he sustained a knee injury in the final game of the Lakers' playoff run.",
      "James, 40, said his left knee is feeling \u201cgood\u201d after spraining a ligament in April, following the Lakers season-ending loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He emphasized that maintaining his body \u2014 through disciplined eating and training routines \u2014 remains essential to performing at the highest level.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of time to take care of my injury, my knee, the rest of my body and make sure I\u2019m as close to 100% as possible when training camp begins in late September,\u201d James told The Associated Press. He spoke during an interview about starring in a new 60-second commercial called \u201cWhat's Next?,\u201d which announces the July 8-11 Prime Day dates as part of a global \u201cGreatness is a Deal Away\u201d campaign.",
      "These days, James has built a wide-reaching partnership with Amazon, launching his men's grooming line and hosting the \u201cMind the Game\u201d podcast alongside NBA legend Steve Nash through Wondery.",
      "In the commercial, James is asked whether the retirement rumors are true, but his attention drifts toward the deals. While the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer might be tempted by discounts, he\u2019s far from done with the game. He still thrives on the daily grind \u2014 including practices, film sessions and shootarounds \u2014 and hasn\u2019t lost the hunger to compete.",
      "A major reason he continues to push forward? Family. James credits the unwavering support of his wife, Savannah, and their three kids as a driving force. He\u2019s inspired by the chance to share the court with his oldest son, Bronny, who plays for the Lakers; to watch Bryce begin his college journey at the University of Arizona; and to cheer on Zhuri as she pursues volleyball.",
      "The best thing about his children is they've never pressured him to end his career, said James, who has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points per game along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds and was an All-NBA selection.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re like \u2018Dad, continue on your dream. This is your dream. Continue on your focus. You\u2019ve been here for us this whole time,'\" he continued. \"When you have that type of support... it makes it a lot easier.\u201d",
      "James knows the end of his legendary career is coming, but he\u2019s just not sure when. He said it would be \u201cinsane\u201d if he stuck around long enough to play with his son, Bryce, who would be draft eligible in 2026.",
      "\u201cAt this point of my career, you think about when the end is. That\u2019s human nature,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think: Is it this year? Or next year? Those thoughts always creep into your mind at this point of the journey. But I have not given it a specific timetable, date. I\u2019m seeing how my body and family reacts, too.\u201d",

      "The Senate is voting on legislation regulating a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to approve legislation Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what is expected to be a wave of crypto legislation from Congress that the industry hopes will bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.",
      "The fast-moving legislation, which will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle where the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.",
      "Eighteen Democratic senators have shown support for the legislation as it has advanced, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate. If passed, it would become the second major bipartisan bill to advance through the Senate this year, following the Laken Riley Act on immigration enforcement in January.",
      "Still, most Democrats oppose the bill. They have raised concerns that the measure does little to address President Donald Trump\u2019s personal financial interests in the crypto space.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to include certainly everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort,\" said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., on Monday. She added, \u201cThis is an unregulated area that will now be regulated.\u201d",
      "Known as the GENIUS Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.\u201d",
      "It's expected to pass Tuesday, since it only requires a simple majority vote \u2014 and it already cleared its biggest procedural hurdle last week in a 68-30 vote. But the bill has faced more resistance than initially expected.",
      "There is a provision in the bill that bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House.",
      "Trump hosted a private dinner last month at his golf club with top investors in a Trump-branded meme coin. His family holds a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that provides yet another avenue where investors are buying in and enriching the president\u2019s relatives. World Liberty has launched its own stablecoin, USD1.",
      "The administration is broadly supportive of crypto's growth and its integration into the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the legislation could help push the U.S. stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028.",
      "Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest crypto exchange and a major advocate for the bill \u2014 has met with Trump and praised his early moves on crypto. This past weekend, Coinbase was among the more prominent brands that sponsored a parade in Washington commemorating the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 an event that coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "But the crypto industry emphasizes that they view the legislative effort as bipartisan, pointing to champions on each side of the aisle.",
      "\u201cThe GENIUS Act will be the most significant digital assets legislation ever to pass the U.S. Senate,\u201d Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said ahead of a key vote last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the product of months of bipartisan work.\u201d",
      "The bill did hit one rough patch in early May, when a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously supported the bill reversed course and voted to block it from advancing. That prompted new negotiations involving Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, which ultimately produced the compromise version expected to win passage Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere were many, many changes that were made. And ultimately, it\u2019s a much better deal because we were all at the table,\u201d Alsobrooks said.",
      "Still, the bill leaves unresolved concerns over presidential conflicts of interest \u2014 an issue that remains a source of tension within the Democratic caucus.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been among the most outspoken as the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, warning that the bill creates a \u201csuper highway\u201d for Trump corruption. She has also warned that the bill would allow major technology companies, such as Amazon and Meta, to launch their own stablecoins.",
      "If the stablecoin legislation passes the Senate on Tuesday, it still faces several hurdles before reaching the president\u2019s desk. It must clear the narrowly held Republican majority in the House, where lawmakers may try to attach a broader market structure bill \u2014 sweeping legislation that could make passage through the Senate more difficult.",
      "Trump has said he wants stablecoin legislation on his desk before Congress breaks for its August recess, now just under 50 days away.",

      "Louisiana soon could raise taxes on sports betting to help finance the athletic departments at many of its public universities",
      "Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments at the state's most prominent public universities.",
      "Legislation pending before Gov. Jeff Landry would make Louisiana the first state to raise taxes to fund college sports since a judge approved a landmark settlement with the NCAA allowing schools to directly pay athletes for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). Anticipating the court's approval, Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on NIL payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.",
      "More states seem almost certain to adopt their own creative ways to gain an edge \u2014 or at least keep pace \u2014 in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college sports.",
      "\u201cThese bills, and the inevitable ones that will follow, are intended to make states \u2019college-athlete friendly,'\u201d said David Carter, founder of the Sports Business Group consultancy and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California. But \u201cthey will no doubt continue to stoke the debate about the `perceived' preferential treatment afforded athletes.\u201d",
      "The new NCCA rules allowing direct payments to college athletes kick in July 1. In the first year, each Division I school can share up to $20.5 million with its athletes \u2014 a figure that may be easier to meet for big-time programs than for smaller schools weighing whether to divert money from other purposes. The settlement also continues to allow college athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, such as donor-backed collectives that support specific schools.",
      "The Louisiana legislation won final approval just two days after a judge approved the antitrust settlement between the NCAA and athletes, but it had been in the works for months. Athletic directors from many of Louisiana's universities met earlier this year and hashed out a plan with lawmakers to relieve some of their financial pressures by dividing a share of the state's sports betting tax revenue.",
      "The biggest question for lawmakers was how large of a tax increase to support. The initial proposal sought to double the state's 15% tax on net proceeds from online sports betting. But lawmakers ultimately agreed on a 21.5% tax rate in a compromise with the industry.",
      "One-quarter of the tax revenue from online sports wagering \u2014 an estimated $24.3 million \u2014 would be split equally among 11 public universities in conferences with Division I football programs. The money must be used \u201cfor the benefit of student athletes,\u201d including scholarships, insurance, medical coverage, facility enhancements and litigation settlement fees.",
      "The state tax money won't provide direct NIL payments to athletes. But it could facilitate that indirectly by freeing up other university resources.",
      "The legislation passed overwhelmingly in the final days of Louisiana's annual session.",
      "\u201cWe love football in Louisiana \u2013 that\u2019s the easiest way to say it,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Neil Riser, who sponsored the bill.",
      "Many colleges and universities across the country have been feeling a financial squeeze, but it's especially affected the athletic departments of smaller schools.",
      "Athletic departments in the top Division I football conferences take in millions of dollars from media rights, donors, corporate sponsors and ticket sales, with a median of just 7% coming from student fees and institutional and government support, according to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database.",
      "But the remaining schools in Division I football bowl conferences got a median of 63% of the revenue from such sources last year. And schools without football teams got a median of 81% of their athletic department revenues from institutional and governmental support or student fees.",
      "Riser said Louisiana's smaller universities, in particular, have been struggling financially and have shifted money from their general funds to their sports programs to try to remain competitive. At the same time, the state has taken in millions of dollars of tax revenue from sports bets made at least partly on college athletics.",
      "\u201cWithout the athletes, we wouldn\u2019t have the revenue. I just felt like it\u2019s fairness that we do give something back and, at the same time, help the general funds of the universities,\u201d Riser said.",
      "Louisiana would become the second state behind North Carolina to dedicate a portion of its sports wagering revenues to colleges athletics. North Carolina launched online sports wagering last year under a state law earmarking part of an 18% tax on gross gaming revenue to the athletic departments at 13 public universities. The state's two largest institutions were excluded. But that might be about to change.",
      "Differing budget plans passed by the state House and Senate this year both would start allotting sports betting tax revenue to the athletic programs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The Senate version also would double the tax rate. The proposals come a year after University of North Carolina trustees approved an audit of the athletics department after a preliminary budget projected about $100 million of debt in the years ahead.",
      "Other schools also are taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct NIL payments to athletes. That came after trustees in April voted to convert the Kentucky athletics department into a limited-liability holding company \u2014 Champions Blue LLC \u2014 to more nimbly navigate the emerging financial pressures.",
      "Given the money involved in college athletics, it's not surprising that states are starting to provide tax money to athletic departments or \u2014 as in Arkansas' case \u2014 tax relief to college athletes, said Patrick Rishe, executive director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "\u201cIf you can attract better athletes to your schools and your states, then this is more visibility to your states, this is more potential out-of-town economic activity for your state,\" Rishe said. \u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see many states pursue this, because you don\u2019t want to be the state that\u2019s left exposed or at a disadvantage.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans are proposing deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making President Donald Trump\u2019s tax breaks more permanent",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Monday proposed deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making President Donald Trump's tax breaks more permanent in draft legislation unveiled for his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "The proposals from Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.",
      "The Senate draft also enhances Trump's proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.",
      "All told, the text unveiled by the Senate Finance Committee Republicans provides the most comprehensive look yet at changes the GOP senators want to make to the 1,000-page package approved by House Republicans last month. GOP leaders are pushing to fast-track the bill for a vote by Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairman, said the proposal would prevent a tax hike and achieve \u201csignificant savings\u201d by slashing green energy funds \u201cand targeting waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "It comes as Americans broadly support levels of funding for popular safety net programs, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Many Americans see Medicaid and food assistance programs as underfunded.",
      "Trump's big bill is the centerpiece of his domestic policy agenda, a hodgepodge of GOP priorities all rolled into what he calls the \u201cbeautiful bill\u201d that Republicans are trying to swiftly pass over unified opposition from Democrats \u2014 a tall order for the slow-moving Senate.",
      "Fundamental to the package is the extension of some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks approved during his first term, in 2017, that are expiring this year if Congress fails to act. There are also new ones, including no taxes on tips, as well as more than $1 trillion in program cuts.",
      "After the House passed its version, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the nation\u2019s deficits over the decade, and leave 10.9 fewer people without health insurance, due largely to the proposed new work requirements and other changes.",
      "The biggest tax breaks, some $12,000 a year, would go to the wealthiest households, CBO said, while the poorest would see a tax hike of roughly $1,600. Middle-income households would see tax breaks of $500 to $1,000 a year, CBO said.",
      "Both the House and Senate packages are eyeing a massive $350 billion buildup of Homeland Security and Pentagon funds, including some $175 billion for Trump's mass deportation efforts, such as the hiring of 10,000 more officers for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "This comes as protests over deporting migrants have erupted nationwide \u2014 including the stunning handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla last week in Los Angeles \u2014 and as deficit hawks such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul are questioning the vast spending on Homeland Security.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that the Senate GOP's draft \u201ccuts to Medicaid are deeper and more devastating than even the Republican House\u2019s disaster of a bill.\u201d",
      "As the package now moves to the Senate, the changes to Medicaid, SALT and green energy programs are part of a series of tradeoffs GOP leaders are making as they try to push the package to passage with their slim majorities, with almost no votes to spare.",
      "But criticism of the Senate's version came quickly after House Speaker Mike Johnson warned senators off making substantial changes.",
      "\u201cWe have been crystal clear that the SALT deal we negotiated in good faith with the Speaker and the White House must remain in the final bill,\u201d the co-chairs of the House SALT caucus, Reps. Young Kim, R-Calif., and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., said in a joint statement Monday.",
      "Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York posted on X that the $10,000 cap in the Senate bill was not only insulting, but a \u201cslap in the face to the Republican districts that delivered our majority and trifecta\u201d with the White House.",
      "Some of the largest cost savings in the package come from the GOP plan to impose new work requirements on able-bodied single adults, ages 18 to 64 and without dependents, who receive Medicaid, the health care program used by 80 million Americans.",
      "While the House first proposed the new Medicaid work requirement, it exempted parents with dependents. The Senate's version broadens the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.",
      "Already, the Republicans had proposed expanding work requirements in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to include older Americans up to age 64 and parents of school-age children older than 10. The House had imposed the requirement on parents of children older than 7.",
      "People would need to work 80 hours a month or be engaged in a community service program to qualify.",
      "One Republican, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, has joined a few others pushing to save Medicaid from steep cuts \u2014 including to the so-called provider tax that almost all states levy on hospitals as a way to help fund their programs.",
      "The Senate plan proposes phasing down that provider tax, which is now up to 6%. Starting in 2027, the Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.",
      "Hawley slammed the Senate bill's changes on the provider tax. \u201cThis needs a lot of work. It\u2019s really concerning and I\u2019m really surprised by it,\u201d he said. \u201cRural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.\"",
      "The Senate also keeps in place the House's proposed new $35-per-service co-pay imposed on some Medicaid patients who earn more than the poverty line, which is about $32,000 a year for a family of four, with exceptions for some primary, prenatal, pediatric and emergency room care.",
      "And Senate Republicans are seeking a slower phase-out of some Biden-era green energy tax breaks to allow continued develop of wind, solar and other projects that the most conservative Republicans in Congress want to end more quickly. Tax breaks for electric vehicles would be immediately eliminated.",
      "Conservative Republicans say the cuts overall don't go far enough, and they oppose the bill's provision to raise the national debt limit by $5 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "\"We\u2019ve got a ways to go on this one,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.",

      "The U.S. economy is mostly in good shape but that isn\u2019t saving Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell from a spell of angst",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy is mostly in good shape but that isn't saving Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell from a spell of angst.",
      "As the Fed considers its next moves during a two-day meeting this week, most economic data looks solid: Inflation has been steadily fading, while the unemployment rate is still a historically low 4.2%. Yet President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs may push inflation higher in the coming months, while also possibly slowing growth.",
      "With the outlook uncertain, Fed policymakers are expected to keep their key interest rate unchanged on Wednesday at about 4.4%. Officials will also release a set of quarterly economic projections that are expected to show inflation will accelerate later this year, while unemployment my also tick up a bit.",
      "The projections may also signal that the Fed will cut its key rate twice later this year, economists say.",
      "The prospect of higher inflation would typically lead the Fed to keep rates unchanged or even raise them, while rising unemployment would usually lead the Fed to cut its key rate. With the economy potentially pulling in both directions, Powell and other Fed officials have underscored in recent remarks that they are prepared to wait for clearer signals on which way to move.",
      "The Fed is in \u201can uncomfortable purgatory,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting giant KPMG. \u201cWithout the threat of tariffs, we would be seeing the Fed cut. That's not where we're at because of the uncertainty and the threat and the effects (of tariffs) that we don't know yet.\"",
      "The Trump White House has sharply ramped up the pressure on Powell to reduce borrowing costs, with Trump himself calling the Fed chair a \u201cnumbskull\u201d for not cutting and other officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also calling for a rate reduction.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key short-term rate, it often \u2014 though not always \u2014 leads to lower costs for consumer and business borrowing, including for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. Yet financial markets also influence the level of longer-term rates and can keep them elevated even if the Fed reduces the shorter-term rate it controls.",
      "For example, if investors worry that inflation will remain elevated, they can demand higher interest rates on longer-term Treasury securities, which influence other borrowing costs.",
      "Even though Trump has said the economy is doing well, he has also argued that a rate cut would cause the economy to take off \u201clike a rocket.\u201d",
      "But Trump has also highlighted another concern: If the Fed doesn't cut rates, the federal government will have to pay more interest on its huge budget deficits, which are projected to grow even larger under the White House's proposed tax and budget legislation currently being considered by the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend $600 billion a year, $600 billion because of one numbskull that sits here (and says), \u2018I don\u2019t see enough reason to cut the rates now,'\" Trump said last week.",
      "Pushing the Fed to cut rates simply to save the government on its interest payments typically raises alarms among economists, because it would threaten the Fed's congressional mandate to focus on stable prices and maximum employment.",
      "Yet the markets haven't reacted much to Trump's recent attacks on the Fed, now that the Supreme Court, in a ruling last month, suggested that a president doesn't have the legal power to fire the Fed chair.",
      "Still, with inflation remaining low, so far, despite the imposition of tariffs, the Fed may come under greater pressure in the coming months from economists and investors to cut rates. Policymakers estimate that the interest rate that would neither stimulate the economy nor slow it down \u2014 known as the \u201cneutral rate\u201d \u2014 is about 3%.",
      "Meanwhile, inflation \u2014 according to the Fed's preferred measure \u2014 is just 2.1%, almost back to the central bank's 2% target. Such a low reading suggests the Fed's rate should be closer to neutral, below its current level of 4.4%, because it doesn't need a high rate to slow inflation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable case for the Fed to grapple with,\" said Jon Hilsenrath, a visiting scholar at Duke University.",
      "Yet according to a survey Hilsenrath conducted for Duke of former Fed officials and staff, they expect the Fed to cut interest rates just once this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that inflation moves up and they don\u2019t want to get ahead of themselves,\u201d he said.",
      "It's possible that tariffs may not push up inflation as much as economists have feared. But one reason for that could be that the economy may slow, lifting unemployment and making consumers unwilling to pay higher prices, which would reduce inflation.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs said in a recent research note that they expect inflation will rise to 3.6% by December, but that the increase will only be temporary.",
      "\u201cThe main reason we are less worried is that we expect the economy to be weak this year, with ... a modest rise in the unemployment rate,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman, and his colleagues wrote.",
      "A noticeable weakening of the economy that slows consumer spending and holds down inflation would likely lead the Fed to quickly cut rates. But they will be more comfortable doing so once they have a better sense of the full impact of tariffs.",
      "Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note Monday that the Fed \u201cwill need several months to assess the effects of policy changes, believing that \u2018later and correct is better than sooner and wrong.\u2019\u201d",

      "In 2005, Rebecca van Bergen was a graduate student in social work at Washington University when she won $24,000 in a school innovation contest. That seed money sparked the creation of Nest Inc., a nonprofit that empowers women artisans globally by providing training, funding, and market access.",
      "From its modest beginnings, Nest has grown into a force in the artisan economy. It now supports creators in 125 countries and 47 U.S. states, helping women transition from informal craft work to sustainable business ownership. Nest\u2019s network includes around 3,000 handcraft businesses and has reached more than 345,000 entrepreneurs \u2014 mainly women \u2014 with grants and coaching on skills like pricing and financial management.",
      "\u201cMost people still have an aunt or grandmother who knits or crochets or made them clothes,\u201d van Bergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty deeply embedded in our societies. It\u2019s income-generating, and it also preserves cultures.\u201d",
      "Van Bergen\u2019s first break came in 2010 when Nest partnered with FEED Projects, fashion designer Lauren Bush\u2019s social enterprise. That relationship opened doors to collaborations with Amazon, Etsy, and West Elm. Over the years, Nest\u2019s mission has attracted support from funders like the Oak and Moody\u2019s foundations \u2014 as well retailers like Tory Burch and L.L.Bean, now totaling 25 companies, which purchase and sell the artists\u2019 goods.",
      "From an initial team of two, Nest has grown to 33 staff members, with net assets of $6 million and annual revenue of $7.2 million in 2025 \u2014 nearly double its 2019 revenue. It doesn\u2019t take a cut of artisan sales, relying instead on grants, program service revenue, fundraising events, and individual donations. The organization has received more than $10 million in grant funding since 2017, according to tax information from Cause IQ, which collects nonprofit data.",
      "In recent years, Nest has expanded domestically, providing funds and training artists in all but three U.S. states.",
      "Among the artisans is Stef Ratliff, who was born and raised in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky. She creates custom pottery and art through her KYARTRAT business. Though she had painted trophies for the Americana Music Awards for more than a decade \u2014 and created a custom guitar for Grace Bowers at this year\u2019s Grammys \u2014 Ratliff struggled to run a sustainable business until joining Nest and working as a community manager identifying Appalachian artists.",
      "\u201cI did a business consultation program with them (that) focused on marketing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt taught me I can make the greatest pot or painting of all time, but if I don\u2019t present them in the right light, no one is going to see them properly.\u201d",
      "Working with Nest and connecting to Etsy through a joint program called Uplift Makers was fundamental to setting up an Etsy shop for KYARTRAT, Ratliff said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all reaching new customers through Etsy,\u201d she said, referring to Nest\u2019s eastern Kentucky group of 100 artisans.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s huge for Appalachia,\u201d Ratliff said. \u201cI would never have thought to sell my pottery through Etsy because I felt like a lot of people don\u2019t really care about southern stories and Appalachian stories. I didn\u2019t think they really cared about history.\u201d",
      "Nest\u2019s mission is rooted in van Bergen\u2019s own experience watching her grandmother and great-grandmother sew and quilt. The organization focuses on traditional crafts like basket weaving, ceramics, and candle-making, which are both income-generating and culturally meaningful.",
      "Globally, the handcraft market is valued at $906.8 billion and a vital source of employment, especially for women, according to the data service Research and Markets. Nest helps artisans tap into this market by connecting them to brands like GAP, Ralph Lauren, Target, and Amazon.",
      "In 2021, Nest partnered with Etsy to launch the Uplift Makers Program to support six heritage craft communities, including Gullah basket weavers from South Carolina, quilt makers from the Gee\u2019s Bend area of Alabama\u2019s rural Black Belt region, Afghan refugee craft business owners throughout the United States, Indigenous artisans from the United States and Canada, artisans from Oaxaca, Mexico, and craft makers from Appalachia.",
      "Etsy supported the Gee\u2019s Bend quilters with a $50,000 grant and has since helped over 140 U.S. artisans generate more than $1 million in sales.",
      "Recently, Nest received a $300,000 grant from the Mastercard Impact Fund to bolster its work with Appalachian artisans.",
      "Nest has adapted to economic shifts and policy changes over the years. During the pandemic, it prioritized financial literacy and business development. Now, it\u2019s monitoring global trade policies \u2014 like tariffs \u2014 that could affect both artists and their retail partners.",
      "Nest intentionally chose not to pursue microlending, which was popular among development groups in the early 2000s but sometimes left borrowers in debt. Instead, the organization focuses on partnerships with groups like Indego Africa, which works with over 700 artisans in Ghana and Rwanda. That partnership has helped connect Ghanaian craftswomen to retailers like Tory Burch, which sells their hand-woven straw tote bags for close to $500.",
      "\u201cThose partnerships are super valuable, both to us and to our partners, because the size of those orders tends to be quite large. It could be anywhere from 300 items to 1,500 items,\u201d said Sara Wohlers, Indego Africa\u2019s director of marketing and communications. \u201cThat creates a lot of consistent work for our partners, and consistent income.\u201d",
      "As Nest shifts to more U.S.-focused work, it is helping women who face similar economic barriers.",
      "Among them is Cynthia Main, a Kentucky-based woodworker who has participated in Nest\u2019s Makers Future Fund, a program that provides professional coaching with a $5,000 grant. Main owns Sunhouse Craft, where she sells handmade brooms, dustpans, and other goods. Despite Berea\u2019s status as Kentucky\u2019s folk arts capital, its economy has suffered from industrial closures and persistent poverty \u2014 nearly 1 in 5 residents lives below the poverty line.",
      "Main said Nest helped her overcome many financial and retail obstacles and build a broader client base for her products. She used her $5,000 grant to attend her first wholesale trade show in New York. That exposure helped double her company\u2019s annual profits, from $120,000 to more than $240,000.",
      "\u201cI just think the work that Nest is doing is so important,\u201d Main said. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how being in a rural place, there\u2019s not a lot of help, or a lot of people who understand the uniqueness of a handmade business, and their advice has been so spot on.\u201d",

      "Estee Lauders Cos. announced the news in a release on Sunday and said he died on Saturday surrounded by family.",
      "Lauder, the oldest son of Estee and Joseph H. Lauder, who founded the company in 1946, formally joined the New York business in 1958. Over more than six decades, Lauder played a key role in transforming the business from a handful of products sold under a single brand in U.S. stores to a multi-brand global giant. He had held the title of chairman emeritus at the time of his death.",
      "Estee Lauder's products are sold in roughly 150 countries and territories under brand names including Clinique and Aveda, according to the company's latest annual report. The company generated sales of nearly $16 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the filing said.",
      "Estee Lauder went public in 1995, but members of Lauder family still have about 84% of the voting power of common stock, according to the latest annual filing.",
      "Lauder served as president of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. from 1972 to 1995 and as CEO from 1982 through 1999. He was named chairman in 1995 and served in that role through June 2009.",
      "Under his stewardship, Lauder created the company\u2019s first research and development laboratory, brought in professional management at every level, and was the impetus behind The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos.\u2019 international expansion, helping to spearhead the company\u2019s sales and profits exponentially, according to the company.",
      "Lauder led the launch of many brands including Aramis, Clinique, and Lab Series, among others. Until his death, he remained deeply involved in the company\u2019s acquisition strategy, including the acquisitions of such brands as Aveda, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone London and MAC, the company said.",
      "During his years as chairman emeritus, Lauder was closely involved in the business and day-to-day operations and was a constant fixture at its global headquarters in New York and at its stores around the world until the time of his death, the company said.",
      "\u201cThroughout his life, my father worked tirelessly to build and transform the beauty industry, pioneering many of the innovations, trends, and best practices that are foundational to the industry today,\u201d said William P. Lauder, son and chair of the board at The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies in a statement. \u201cHe was the most charitable man I have ever known, believing that art and education belonged to everyone, and championing the fight against diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and breast cancer. \u201d",
      "Lauder was a longtime patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, in 2013, pledged his 78-piece collection of Cubist art to the museum in the largest single philanthropic gift in the museum's history. He later added five major works to that pledged gift, the company said.",
      "In concert with his Cubist collection donation, he helped establish the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art at the Met to support a program of fellowships, focused exhibitions, and public lectures. He also was the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s chairman emeritus and a trustee from 1977 to 2011.",
      "Lauder was married to Evelyn H. Lauder, who had been the senior corporate vice president at the cosmetic company and the founder of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, from 1959 until she passed away in 2011.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2015, Lauder married Judy Glickman Lauder, a philanthropist and internationally recognized photographer.",
      "Lauder was born in 1933 in New York City. He was a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, and the Officer Candidate School of the United States Navy.",
      "Lauder studied at Columbia University\u2019s graduate school of business. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and as a Navy reservist, for which the U.S. Navy Supply Corps Foundation later recognized him with its Distinguished Alumni Award.",
      "In addition to his wife and son William, Lauder is survived by his other son Gary M. Lauder and wife, Laura Lauder; five grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, many stepchildren and step grandchildren, as well as his brother, Ronald S. Lauder, and wife, Jo Carole Lauder, and their daughters, Aerin Lauder and Jane Lauder.",

      "A judge in Mali has placed Canadian mining company Barrick Gold under provisional administration in an ongoing dispute with the military government over alleged unpaid taxes",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- A judge in Mali on Monday ordered Barrick Gold's Loulo-Gounkoto gold complex to be placed under provisional administration for six months in an ongoing dispute between the Canadian mining company and the West African nation's military government over unpaid taxes.",
      "Zoumana Makadji, an accountant and a former Malian minister of health has been appointed as the company's provisional administrator within 15 days, Judge Issa Aguibou Diallo said in a statement to Barrick\u2019s lawyers.",
      "Barrick's website said the company is Africa\u2019s largest gold producer through its Loulo-Gounkoto complex and Kibali mine located in Congo.",
      "Barrick Gold has been in conflict with Mali's military rulers over alleged unpaid taxes and unfair contracts with past governments. The dispute culminated in an arrest warrant in December for Barrick CEO Mark Bristow and the company\u2019s offer to pay $370 million to the government.",
      "\u201cWhile Barrick\u2019s subsidiaries remain the legal owners of the mine, operational control has been transferred to an external administrator,\u201d Barrick said in a statement on its website following the ruling.",
      "In December, Barrick submitted a request for arbitration to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes to address disagreements with Mali concerning the Loulo-Gounkoto complex, where the mines are located.",
      "Despite this, the government took a series of escalatory measures, including the arrest of Barrick Gold employees, who remain detained, and the suspension of gold exports.",
      "Barrick, which has been present in Mali for three decades, emphasized that the arbitration process was still ongoing and reaffirmed its commitment to \u201cengaging with the government of Mali, in parallel, to identify a constructive, mutually acceptable solution.\u201d",
      "The company's statement on Monday added: \"The ongoing detention of (our) employees \u2014 who remain unjustly imprisoned and used as leverage in this process \u2014 is deeply concerning and inconsistent with the trust, transparency and accountability required for a genuine long-term partnership.",
      "\u201cTo date, no credible rationale has been presented to justify this detention and the Government\u2019s position, and the Government\u2019s ever-increasing demands have lacked both factual and legal foundation.\u201d",
      "Mali is one of Africa\u2019s leading gold producers, but it has struggled for years with jihadi violence and high levels of poverty and hunger. The military seized power in 2020, and the government has placed foreign mining companies under growing pressure as it seeks to shore up revenues.",
      "In November, the CEO of Australian company Resolute Mining and two employees were arrested in Bamako. They were released after the company paid $80 million to Malian authorities to resolve a tax dispute and promised to pay a further $80 million in the coming months.",

    "story": [
      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- In the end, not even Saudi Arabia or Gianni Infantino could engineer a way to get Cristiano Ronaldo to the Club World Cup.",
      "FIFA president Infantino certainly tried - last month making a public appeal ahead of the tournament.",
      "\u201cIf any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup ...,\u201d he teased during an interview with YouTuber iShowSpeed.",
      "Ronaldo's contract with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr was due to expire and FIFA's decision to create a specially-made mini transfer window for its newest competition meant the path was clear for the Real Madrid great to sign a short-term deal with a new team just in time to take part.",
      "Given his connection to Saudi Arabia, where he was the face of the oil-rich kingdom's spectacular drive to sign some of soccer's biggest stars in recent years, rumors began to circulate about a move to Al Hilal - the country's most successful team and its sole representative at the Club World Cup.",
      "The problem was that Al Hilal and Al-Nassr are cross-city rivals in Riyadh. And even if Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund majority owns both teams - along with others - that was a step too far.",
      "\u201cAs much as I respect Ronaldo as a huge player, as we all recognize he is, it\u2019s certainly completely counter-intuitive that you bring the biggest player of your biggest opponent to play with you,\" Al Hilal chief executive Esteve Calzada told the BBC. \u201cEven more when it\u2019s only for three to four weeks.\"",
      "Maybe so, but Saudi Arabia, with its vast wealth, has a made habit out of turning the improbable into the possible. And the very fact the prospect of a short-term move between clubs was even rumored, points to the boundaries it has been able to push while making its big play to become a force in global sport.",
      "It has, after all, already changed the face of golf and virtually cornered the market for big time boxing. F1 racing is a fixed event and top class tennis has been lured, as well.",
      "It\u2019s ambitions in soccer have been the most spectacular of all - winning the right to host the 2034 World Cup, buying one of the Premier League\u2019s most iconic teams in Newcastle and luring a slew of superstar players to a league that has nothing like the profile of those in Europe or Latin America.",
      "Most recently it has played a role in helping to fund the Club World Cup - either directly or indirectly - with a reported $1 billion investment in tournament broadcaster DAZN and a commercial partnership with FIFA, which has put up a $1 billion prize pot for teams competing.",
      "The Club World Cup is the chance for Saudi Arabia to make a latest statement on the international stage in its first chance test one of its elite clubs against the best from around the globe - starting with 15-time European champion Real Madrid at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on Wednesday.",
      "That is why it is surprising there wasn't more of a push to furnish Al Hilal with the type of marquee signing Saudi Arabian clubs have been collecting since Ronaldo\u2019s move opened the floodgates at the end of 2022.",
      "The four-time Asian champion even released Brazil great Neymar in January after an ACL injury reduced him to just seven appearances following his $94 million move from Paris Saint-Germain in 2023.",
      "A move was made for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes just before the Club World Cup, but the Portugal midfielder rejected the offer. There was also reported interest in striker Victor Osimhen and Darwin Nunez, though no major deals were secured before the team flew out to the United States.",
      "\u201cThe club is working in order to improve the team, and I believe this will be done. Now it\u2019s pointless to talk about market because the market is closed,\u201d coach Simone Inzaghi Tuesday. And he still has big money recruits from overseas in the form of players like Aleksandar Mitrovic, Joao Cancelo, Kalidou Koulibaly and Ruben Neves.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge is urging NASCAR and two of its teams to settle their increasingly acrimonious legal fight that spilled over into tense arguments during a hearing this week",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A federal judge urged NASCAR and two of its teams, including one owned by retired NBA great Michael Jordan, to settle their increasingly acrimonious legal fight that spilled over into tense arguments during a hearing on Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell of the Western District of North Carolina grilled both NASCAR and the teams \u2014 23XI Racing, which is owned by Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by entrepreneur Bob Jenkins \u2014 on what they hoped to accomplish in the antitrust battle that has loomed over the stock car series for months.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to picture a winner if this goes to the mat \u2014 or to the flag \u2014 in this case,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt scares me to death to think about what all this is costing.\u201d",
      "23XI and Front Row were the only two organizations that refused to sign a take-it-or-leave-it offer from NASCAR last September on a new charter agreement. Charters are NASCAR's version of a franchise model, with each charter guaranteeing entry to the lucrative Cup Series races and a stable revenue stream; 13 other teams signed the agreements last fall, with some contending they had little choice.",
      "The nearly two-hour hearing was on the teams\u2019 request to toss out NASCAR\u2019s countersuit, which accuses Jordan business manager Curtis Polk of \u201cwillfully\u201d violating antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in negotiations. NASCAR said it learned in discovery that Polk in messages among the 15 teams tried to form a \u201ccartel\u201d type operation that would include threats of boycotting races and a refusal to individually negotiate.",
      "One of NASCAR's attorneys even cited a Benjamin Franklin quote Polk allegedly sent to the 15 organizations that read: \u201cWe must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.\"",
      "Jeffrey Kessler, an attorney representing the teams, was angered by the revelation in open court, contending it is privileged information only revealed in discovery. Kessler also argued none of NASCAR's claims in the countersuit prove anything illegal was done by Polk or the Race Team Alliance during the charter negotiation process.",
      "\u201cNASCAR knows it has no defense to the monopolization case so they have come up with this claim about joint negotiations, which they agreed to, never objected to, and now suddenly it's an antitrust violation,\u201d Kessler said outside court. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense. It's not going to help them deflect from the monopolizing they have done in this market and the harm they have inflicted.\u201d",
      "He added that \u201cthe attacks\u201d on Polk were \"false, unfounded and frankly beneath the dignity of my adversary to even make those type of comments, which he should know better about.\u201d",
      "NASCAR attorneys said Polk improperly tried to pressure all 15 teams that comprise the RTA to stand together collectively in negotiations and encouraged boycotting qualifying races for the 2024 Daytona 500. NASCAR, they said, took the threat seriously because the teams had previously boycotted a scheduled meeting with series executives.",
      "\u201cNASCAR knew the next step was they could boycott a race, which was a threat they had to take seriously,\u201d attorney Lawrence Buterman said on behalf of NASCAR.",
      "Kessler said outside court the two teams are open to settlement talks, but noted NASCAR has said it will not renegotiate the charters. NASCAR\u2019s attorneys declined to comment after the hearing.",
      "Bell did not indicate when he\u2019d rule, other than saying he would decide quickly.",
      "Kessler said he would file an appeal by the end of the week after a three-judge federal appellate panel dismissed a preliminary injunction that required NASCAR to recognize 23XI and Front Row as chartered teams while the court fight is being resolved.",
      "Kessler wants the issue heard by the full appellate court. The injunction has no bearing on the merits of the case, which is scheduled to go to trial in December. The earliest NASCAR can treat the teams as unchartered is one week after the deadline to appeal, provided there is no pending appeal or whenever the appeals process has been exhausted.",
      "There are 36 chartered cars for the 40-car field each week. If 23XI and Front Row are not recognized as chartered, their six cars would have to compete as \u201copen\u201d teams \u2014 which means they\u2019d have to qualify on speed each week to make the race and they would receive a fraction of the money guaranteed for chartered teams.",
      "Some of the arguments Tuesday centered on Jonathan Marshall, the executive director of the RTA. NASCAR has demanded text messages and emails from Marshall and says it has received roughly 100 texts and over 55,000 pages of emails.",
      "NASCAR wants all texts between Marshall and 55 people from 2020 through 2024 that contain specific search terms. Attorneys for the RTA said that covers more than 3,000 texts, some of which are privileged, and some that have been \u201cdeleted to save storage or he didn\u2019t need them anymore.\u201d",
      "That issue is set to be heard during a hearing next Tuesday before Bell.",

      "Almost a year since the Copa America final nearly ended in tragedy, big numbers of soccer fans are back at Hard Rock Stadium",
      "MIAMI -- Almost a year since the Copa America final nearly ended in tragedy, big numbers of soccer fans are back at Hard Rock Stadium \u2014 this time for the Club World Cup with heightened security.",
      "A combined crowd of nearly 120,000 supporters have watched the opening two games staged in Miami. They have been greeted by extra checkpoints and a heavy police presence.",
      "The Miami-Dade Sheriff's Office says lessons have been learned from July of last year when ticketless fans rushed the gates at the home of the Miami Dolphins for a match between Argentina and Colombia, leaving fans terrified and bloodied as security struggled to contain the crush.",
      "The match was delayed an hour, children were in tears and concerns were sparked ahead of two more years of major soccer tournaments being staged in the United States \u2014 the Club World Cup this summer and the men's World Cup in 2026.",
      "This tournament is an early gauge as to how the U.S. will handle fans from 48 countries visiting next year's World Cup. There has been understandable focus on Miami after the shocking scenes at the Copa America when fans from a sellout crowd were too easily able to force their way into the 65,000-seat Hard Rock Stadium.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve put extensive measures in place to protect fans, players and staff,\u201d Miami-Dade Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz said before the tournament. \u201cThe Miami-Dade Sheriff\u2019s Office is leading all security efforts for this global event.\u201d",
      "Last year, police had to lift distressed children over barriers to avoid them being crushed, while elsewhere officers tackled to the ground the ticketless fans they could catch in a forlorn attempt to keep the hoards at bay.",
      "Videos showed some fans trying to climb through air vents to gain entry.",
      "Changes made over the past year mean fans for this tournament must pass through three separate checkpoints that enclose the entire campus before getting close to the stadium. Steel fencing is set up around the perimeter.",
      "First up is a ticket check at temporary gates, taking up large parts of the parking lot where tailgate parties might usually take place. Then comes another airport-style screening under tents where bags are checked by X-ray machines. Even flags need to be approved.",
      "Fans were able to get much closer to the stadium before checkpoints at the Copa America.",
      "\u201cWhen I was at the final, the security guards just opened the gate and started letting people through,\u201d Edison Negron, a Boca Juniors fan from Puerto Rico told The Associated Press when describing the scenes as fans crushed against the barriers last year.",
      "Miami-Dade County said at the time that a full review would be conducted and that the scenes \u201ccannot happen again.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere will be a significant law enforcement and security footprint in and around the stadium to ensure public safety for all the events,\u201d Det. Argemis Colome told the AP while adding social media was being monitored prior to matches.",
      "Preparations have included special training for a rapid-deployment force as part of a multi-agency response to potential crowd trouble.",
      "\u201cIf things go south, we get ready for civil unrest and unruly fans,\u201d the Sheriff's Office said in a social media post.",
      "A large police presence has been evident at both games played at Hard Rock so far \u2014 Saturday\u2019s tournament opener when a crowd of more than 60,000 watched Inter Miami vs. Al Ahly and Monday's match between Boca Juniors and Benfica in front of nearly 56,000.",
      "Patrol cars have been stationed along the interstate outside of the stadium and, within the grounds, officers equipped with face shields and protective clothing are on patrol.",
      "FIFA said it had worked closely with stadium officials, state and federal agencies \u201cto ensure a robust security presence.\u201d",
      "A 2-2 draw between Argentine giant Boca and Benfica of Portugal was the first match at the stadium involving a large number of traveling fans.",
      "FIFA said Boca was the first team to sell out tickets for its three group stage matches, with fans of the 35-time Argentine champion dominating the crowd. No major altercations were reported. Boca plays a second match at Hard Rock against Bayern Munich on Friday.",
      "While only so much can be drawn from two games that have been below capacity, the extra safeguards put in place have been evident, with, as of yet, no repeat of the chaotic scenes at the Copa America.",

      "Given the way Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton was limping on his way out of the postgame news conference after Game 5 of the NBA Finals, it\u2019s safe to assume he\u2019s a fan of the schedule right about now",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Given the way Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton was limping on his way out of the postgame news conference after Game 5 of the NBA Finals, it's safe to assume he's a fan of the schedule right about now.",
      "Put simply, he could use a couple of days off \u2014 at least.",
      "Haliburton has a lower leg injury \u2014 nobody's saying exactly what it is, whether it's ankle or calf or something else \u2014 and it seems to be the sort that if this were a back-to-back situation in December, he'd be missing at least one game. But these are the finals, this is June, there no back-to-backs in the playoffs and when the league gets to the last series two-day breaks between games aren't uncommon.",
      "Amen to that, the Pacers are probably saying right about now.",
      "\u201cThe Finals, the NBA Finals, is one of the great stages in all of sports,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cAnd so, it shouldn\u2019t happen quickly and abruptly. It should happen at the right pace and the right tempo, and the space in between games does help player health. That's a very important aspect of it.\u201d",
      "There was a one-day gap between games in this year's finals just once, separating Games 3 and 4 in Indianapolis. Everything else has seen a two-day gap, as will be the case going into Game 6 at Indy on Thursday night. And if the Pacers win to force a Game 7 back in Oklahoma City, that'll be preceded by another two days off going into an ultimate game on Sunday night.",
      "It should be noted that the Thunder don't mind the schedule being drawn out, either.",
      "\u201cWe recover,\u201d Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cThe finals are great because you get extra time in between the games. I think that\u2019s huge in terms of rest and recovery at this time of the year. I think it\u2019s good for the product. I think it\u2019s a good thing and by the time the ball goes up in the air, everybody is going to be ready to play and everybody is going to be excited.\u201d",
      "Even those who aren't dealing with an injury seem to be welcoming the two-day gaps between finals games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of games. It\u2019s tiring, for sure,\u201d Thunder star and league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cBut every game is tiring. When you\u2019re giving your all, every possession, you\u2019re going to be tired. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one out there that is tired.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t always like this.",
      "The first NBA Finals were in 1947, before the league was called the NBA (it was the Basketball Association of America then) and before the title round was called the finals (after being called the BAA Finals in the early years, it was called the NBA World Championship Series until the mid-1980s).",
      "That first year, Philadelphia and Chicago played five games in seven days. It would be unthinkable to play at that pace now; the NBA, for much of the last decade, hasn't even scheduled stretches like that in the regular season.",
      "The finals between Minneapolis and New York did the same thing \u2014 five games, seven days \u2014 in 1953. Boston and the Los Angeles Lakers played a five-game series in an eight-day span in 1965. Golden State and Washington played four games in eight days in 1975, with two cross-country flights in there as well. And this was long before charter flights became the rule in the NBA, too.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate in this series. Travel is pretty reasonable. Not a long distance,\u201d Carlisle said, evidently aware that the finals has the shortest distance between the dueling cities \u2014 Oklahoma City and Indianapolis are separated by 688 miles by air \u2014 than any finals matchup since 1956. \u201cNot a long flight. I do believe it\u2019s a better circumstance for the overall integrity of the competition.\u201d",
      "The two extra days gives everybody \u2014 Haliburton, coaches, everyone \u2014 more time to get ready. Daigneault, the father of kids ages 3 and 2, said it gives him more time to be a dad between games.",
      "\u201cI do twice as much parenting,\u201d he said, \u201cnot twice as much work.\u201d",
      "Carlisle said coaches get more time to study film, though at this point in the series it's pretty clear that the Thunder and Pacers know each other about as well as they can. And Haliburton will get another 24 hours of whatever scheme the Pacers' medical staff draws up to try to get his leg good to go in Game 6.",
      "\u201cAll these guys playing in this series on both sides. I think it\u2019s pretty clear now that we\u2019re going into the sixth game, and all attention and the crowd noise in both arenas, everything, this is a lifetime opportunity,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cNot many guys are going to sit, even if they are a little banged up.\u201d",

      "Those are among the high-wattage pairs on Tuesday\u2019s preliminary entry list for the reimagined U.S. Open mixed doubles tournament on Aug. 19-20, before singles competition begins Aug. 24.",
      "Ten of the top 11 women in the WTA singles rankings \u2014 Coco Gauff, who just won the French Open for her second Grand Slam title, is the only one missing \u2014 and 10 of the top 11 men on the ATP tour, including No. 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic, have registered to compete for the $1 million top prize that will be split by the winners, an $800,000 increase over last year.",

      "It\u2019s a star-studded group that is a far cry from the mix of doubles specialists usually found in a Grand Slam mixed doubles bracket. Some criticized the changes when they were announced in February, with Errani and Vavassori calling the new format a \u201cpseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show\u201d that would shut out doubles players.",

      "Players still have time to sign up before the July 28 cutoff, and there is no guarantee that the 16 teams announced Tuesday will actually be in the draw in New York. The top eight teams based on their combined singles ranking will automatically get into the field; the other eight pairings will receive wild cards determined by a USTA committee.",
      "\u201cOnce there was an understanding of what the event was, (players) went and ran with it,\u201d said Eric Butorac, USTA senior director of player relations and business development. \u201cThey found their own partners \u2014 whether it was a friendship, a countryman or some even teaming up with a partner that they have off the court.\u201d",

      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- The Florida Panthers repeated as Stanley Cup champions by beating the Edmonton Oilers 5-1 in Game 6 of the final on Tuesday night, becoming the NHL\u2019s first back-to-back winners since Tampa Bay in 2020 and \u201921 and the third team to do it this century.",
      "Sam Reinhart scored four goals, becoming just the fourth player in league history to get that many in a game in the final. His third to complete the hat trick sent rats, along with hats, flying onto the ice. Matthew Tkachuk, one of the faces of the franchise, fittingly scored the Cup clincher.",
      "At the other end of the ice, Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 28 of the 29 shots he faced, closing the door on a rematch with the same end result. The only goal came from fellow Russian Vasily Podkolzin in garbage time, long after the outcome was decided.",
      "That was followed by chants of \u201cWe want the Cup!\u201d as time ticked off the clock. The Panthers already had it. Now they get to keep it.",
      "Not long after the Lightning made three trips to the final in a row, Florida has done the same and now has the makings of a modern-day dynasty. The Panthers have won 11 of 12 playoff series since Matthew Tkachuk arrived by trade and Paul Maurice took over as coach in the summer of 2022.",
      "The only time they have been on the wrong side of a handshake line was the final in Vegas in 2023, only after several key players were dealing with banged up and gutting through significant injuries.",
      "From the core of Tkachuk, Reinhart, Aleksander Barkov and Sam Bennett on down the roster, they were much healthier this time around and were boosted by key trade deadline additions Brad Marchand and Seth Jones. Bennett led all goal-scorers this postseason with 15, and Marchand had six in the final alone.",
      "Getting depth contributions from throughout the lineup allowed them to overpower Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers, who struggled with Florida\u2019s ferocious forecheck and switched goaltenders multiple times in the final. Stuart Skinner got the nod in Game 6 and was again done in by mistakes in front of him that ended with the puck in the net behind him and had his own blunder on Reinhart\u2019s second goal.",
      "McDavid tried to take over but was again stymied by Barkov, Jones and Bobrovsky. He finished with seven points in his second career trip to the final, again denied his first title.",
      "Canada\u2019s Stanley Cup drought reached 31 seasons and 32 years dating to Montreal in 1993. Teams in the U.S. Sun Belt have won it five of the past six times, four of them in Florida.",
      "This run through Tampa Bay in five, Toronto in seven, Carolina in five and Edmonton in six showed how clinical the Panthers have become under Maurice, who has coached more NHL games than everyone except Scotty Bowman and is now a two-time champion.",
      "So is Marchand, who last hoisted the Cup in 2011 with the Boston Bruins. The 14-year gap is the third-longest in league history, just shy of 16 for Chris Chelios from 1986 to 2002 and 15 for Mark Recchi from \u201991 to \u201906.",

      "Rebecca Lobo and Jen Rizzotti have spent the last few years coaching the AAU team that their sons play for",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Rebecca Lobo had just finished broadcasting Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever's nationally televised victory over the New York Liberty last month when she rushed to the airport to catch a flight back home to Connecticut.",
      "She had another game the next day\u2014 and she was coaching in this one.",
      "Lobo has been coaching her son, Thomas, on his AAU team since he was in the seventh grade. That team, CT Force, was playing in the second day of a tournament in Springfield, Massachusetts, close to where the Hall of Famer grew up.",
      "But even if travel delays prevented her from getting there, Lobo wasn't worried. She knew Jen Rizzotti would be.",
      "The two stars from UConn's 1995 women's national championship basketball team have been co-coaching since Rizzotti moved back to Connecticut to take over as the Sun's president in 2021 and was looking for an AAU team for her son, Conor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a blast because we were super close in college and after college, and then when she went down to D.C. we lost a little contact,\" Lobo said. \"Now we get to see each other through the spring and through the fall.\u201d",
      "It's hard to miss a lot of the unselfish play and style the Huskies greats learned in their time under Geno Auriemma and Chris Dailey, who just finished off their 40th year at the school. Lobo and Rizzotti have instilled that in their boys' team.",
      "Lobo laughed at the notion that they were the younger version of the Hall of Fame coaches, although she acknowledged that Rizzotti, who takes the lead as coach in most of the games, has the same fiery passion as Auriemma.",
      "After one play in the boys' game when an official made a call she didn't agree with, the former point guard said something to him. As she walked away, the referee warned her, saying that he heard what she had muttered under her breath and to knock it off, which drew a chuckle from Rizzotti.",
      "Handing the clipboard over to Rizzotti when she moved back to Connecticut was a no-brainer for Lobo. Rizzotti had been a head coach at both Hartford and George Washington for two decades before coming to the Sun.",
      "\u201cOne thing I\u2019m not is stupid. And like, I think I know basketball pretty well,\" Lobo said. \"I didn\u2019t coach in college for 20-plus years like she did. It\u2019s incredible what she does with these kids. Because it\u2019s in practices, not only game strategy, where she\u2019s elite.\u201d",
      "Besides coaching on the bench, Lobo mused that her role off the court is to be the one to tell the kids to put their phones away when they are out to dinner \u2014 a Dailey trait.",
      "Coaching her son's team has allowed Rizzotti to spend more time with him.",
      "\u201cIf we were at home, he\u2019d want to be going to hang out with his friends or he\u2019s in his room sleeping,\u201d Rizzotti said. \u201cWe get a lot of time in the car together. We hang out after the games and have meals together. It\u2019s time that I\u2019ll always cherish and I\u2019ll never have again with him.\u201d",
      "Rizzotti said her son will get mad at her and talk back, but she has seen how much working together has meant to his game and their relationship.",
      "\u201cShe knows what she\u2019s talking about and it feels great that I can go out there and listen to my coach and know that she\u2019s right, like, every time,\u201d Conor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s awesome playing with these guys and being able to play under her, because we just work so well together.\u201d",
      "Their team won the tournament game on that Sunday relatively easily. Lobo graciously took photos between games with players from the girls' AAU teams and talked with players and parents on the boys' side. That's the norm at these tournaments.",
      "Lobo recalled being in Atlantic City for a tournament and a group of boys came up to her on the boardwalk asking for a photo. One of them was wearing a Clark jersey. Before she took the photos, she asked them to name a few other WNBA players and they obliged, rattling off stars of the women's league.",
      "\u201cI was like, this is amazing,\u201d she said.",
      "The championship game \u2014 one of many titles the team has won \u2014 gave Rizzotti a chance to coach against another female head coach, a rarity in boys' AAU basketball. Rizzotti had seen a couple of female coaches on the sidelines at this tournament, but hadn\u2019t come across a female head coach until the finale.",
      "Unfortunately, she's seen the ego of some male coaches get in the way at tournaments.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of men that want to lose to a woman standing on the other sideline and things get said or done that maybe they wouldn\u2019t do in other games,\u201d Rizzotti said. \u201cIf they\u2019re up like five or six points they\u2019d start stalling with like seven or eight minutes to go because there\u2019s no shot clock and they don\u2019t want to lose to us.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana soon could raise taxes on sports betting to help finance the athletic departments at many of its public universities",
      "Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments at the state's most prominent public universities.",
      "Legislation pending before Gov. Jeff Landry would make Louisiana the first state to raise taxes to fund college sports since a judge approved a landmark settlement with the NCAA allowing schools to directly pay athletes for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). Anticipating the court's approval, Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on NIL payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.",
      "More states seem almost certain to adopt their own creative ways to gain an edge \u2014 or at least keep pace \u2014 in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college sports.",
      "\u201cThese bills, and the inevitable ones that will follow, are intended to make states \u2019college-athlete friendly,'\u201d said David Carter, founder of the Sports Business Group consultancy and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California. But \u201cthey will no doubt continue to stoke the debate about the `perceived' preferential treatment afforded athletes.\u201d",
      "The new NCCA rules allowing direct payments to college athletes kick in July 1. In the first year, each Division I school can share up to $20.5 million with its athletes \u2014 a figure that may be easier to meet for big-time programs than for smaller schools weighing whether to divert money from other purposes. The settlement also continues to allow college athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, such as donor-backed collectives that support specific schools.",
      "The Louisiana legislation won final approval just two days after a judge approved the antitrust settlement between the NCAA and athletes, but it had been in the works for months. Athletic directors from many of Louisiana's universities met earlier this year and hashed out a plan with lawmakers to relieve some of their financial pressures by dividing a share of the state's sports betting tax revenue.",
      "The biggest question for lawmakers was how large of a tax increase to support. The initial proposal sought to double the state's 15% tax on net proceeds from online sports betting. But lawmakers ultimately agreed on a 21.5% tax rate in a compromise with the industry.",
      "One-quarter of the tax revenue from online sports wagering \u2014 an estimated $24.3 million \u2014 would be split equally among 11 public universities in conferences with Division I football programs. The money must be used \u201cfor the benefit of student athletes,\u201d including scholarships, insurance, medical coverage, facility enhancements and litigation settlement fees.",
      "The state tax money won't provide direct NIL payments to athletes. But it could facilitate that indirectly by freeing up other university resources.",
      "The legislation passed overwhelmingly in the final days of Louisiana's annual session.",
      "\u201cWe love football in Louisiana \u2013 that\u2019s the easiest way to say it,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Neil Riser, who sponsored the bill.",
      "Many colleges and universities across the country have been feeling a financial squeeze, but it's especially affected the athletic departments of smaller schools.",
      "Athletic departments in the top Division I football conferences take in millions of dollars from media rights, donors, corporate sponsors and ticket sales, with a median of just 7% coming from student fees and institutional and government support, according to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database.",
      "But the remaining schools in Division I football bowl conferences got a median of 63% of the revenue from such sources last year. And schools without football teams got a median of 81% of their athletic department revenues from institutional and governmental support or student fees.",
      "Riser said Louisiana's smaller universities, in particular, have been struggling financially and have shifted money from their general funds to their sports programs to try to remain competitive. At the same time, the state has taken in millions of dollars of tax revenue from sports bets made at least partly on college athletics.",
      "\u201cWithout the athletes, we wouldn\u2019t have the revenue. I just felt like it\u2019s fairness that we do give something back and, at the same time, help the general funds of the universities,\u201d Riser said.",
      "Louisiana would become the second state behind North Carolina to dedicate a portion of its sports wagering revenues to colleges athletics. North Carolina launched online sports wagering last year under a state law earmarking part of an 18% tax on gross gaming revenue to the athletic departments at 13 public universities. The state's two largest institutions were excluded. But that might be about to change.",
      "Differing budget plans passed by the state House and Senate this year both would start allotting sports betting tax revenue to the athletic programs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The Senate version also would double the tax rate. The proposals come a year after University of North Carolina trustees approved an audit of the athletics department after a preliminary budget projected about $100 million of debt in the years ahead.",
      "Other schools also are taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct NIL payments to athletes. That came after trustees in April voted to convert the Kentucky athletics department into a limited-liability holding company \u2014 Champions Blue LLC \u2014 to more nimbly navigate the emerging financial pressures.",
      "Given the money involved in college athletics, it's not surprising that states are starting to provide tax money to athletic departments or \u2014 as in Arkansas' case \u2014 tax relief to college athletes, said Patrick Rishe, executive director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "\u201cIf you can attract better athletes to your schools and your states, then this is more visibility to your states, this is more potential out-of-town economic activity for your state,\" Rishe said. \u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see many states pursue this, because you don\u2019t want to be the state that\u2019s left exposed or at a disadvantage.\u201d",

      "Less than two years after signing Devers to a 10-year, $313.5 million contract, the Red Sox sent him to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday night for pitchers Jordan Hicks and Kyle Harrison and a pair of prospects. The deal came on the day Boston earned a fifth straight win and completed a three-game sweep of the rival New York Yankees \u2014 a rare cause for excitement this season.",
      "\u201cIt was a shock for sure after the run that we just had this past week,\" pitcher Garrett Crochet said in Seattle before Monday night's game against the Mariners. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of season ahead of us. So, it\u2019s really just keeping your eyes forward and knowing that there\u2019s still work to be done.\u201d",
      "Asked what the move means for this year\u2019s team, closer Aroldis Chapman said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Chief Baseball Officer Craig Breslow acknowledged on the conference call Sunday night that the deal leaves a hole in the lineup, but he hoped it would pay off this season. Although there is a newly created need for a power hitter, the team now has roster and payroll flexibility to add players at the trade deadline, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out that this is in no way signifying a waving of the white flag on 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are as committed as we were six months ago to putting a winning team on the field, to competing for the division and making a deep postseason run.\u201d",
      "Devers, a homegrown three-time All-Star, joined Ted Williams as the only Red Sox players with multiple 30-homer seasons before turning 25. But the slugger's relationship with the team soured when it signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman in February. Devers, who led the league in errors by a third baseman in each of the last seven seasons, balked at moving to designated hitter and then refused to play either first or third when Bregman and first baseman Triston Casas both got injured.",
      "\u201cWe have a responsibility to do everything we can to improve the club. And we felt we were doing that by bringing Alex Bregman to the Red Sox,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we have a responsibility, ironically, to every single player in that clubhouse to do everything in our power to improve the club. So it was something that we were committed to doing. And I do not regret that for one minute.\u201d",
      "But they lost Devers in the process.",
      "\u201cWe worked at it. We had a different vision for him going forward than he had, and we couldn\u2019t get there. We couldn\u2019t find alignment,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we reached that inflection point and made the decision to make a big move.\u201d",
      "The move came as a shock to Red Sox fans still salty over the salary dump of Mookie Betts in February 2020 \u2014 after he won the 2018 AL MVP award \u2014 in a trade that yielded little in return. The team also let Xander Bogaerts leave as a free agent before deciding Devers was the player they were willing to invest in.",
      "Now, just one full season later, he\u2019s gone, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some reasons that it didn\u2019t work out,\" manager Alex Cora said. \"But the last few months hasn\u2019t been easy. We made decisions in the offseason. Circumstances changed in the last month and that\u2019s the business decision we made as an organization. Now Raffy is going to be with the Giants and like I said, we have to turn the page and be ready for this team.\u201d",
      "Breslow insisted the deal was not an attempt to cut payroll \u2014 like the deals for Betts, who went on to win two World Series in Los Angeles, or Chris Sale, who won the NL Cy Young Award in his first season with the Braves. The baseball boss acknowledged he second-guessed himself over how he handled the Bregman signing, which caught Devers by surprise, and the attempts to get the 28-year-old All-Star to change positions.",
      "\u201cI think about that question all of the time,\u201d Breslow said. \"This is not the outcome that we had expected. And it\u2019s forced me to reflect on the interactions that I\u2019ve had, not just with Raffy, but with other players and opportunities to communicate differently.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox winning streak has come with Bregman and outfielder Wilyer Abreu sidelined, joining Casas and outfielder Masataka Yoshida on the injured list. In their place, the team has relied on callups like Kristian Campbell, Marcelo Mayer and top prospect Roman Anthony, who made his major league debut to much hype last week.",
      "Breslow said the front office will continue to look for ways to improve the team, with a middle-of-the-lineup hitter a new need.",
      "\u201cFor some reason, this team (is) an example where the whole was not greater than the sum of the parts,\u201d he said. \"And being great teammates and sacrificing and stepping up for each other and embodying this shared vision, we believe that those are principles that we need to be faithful to.",
      "\u201cAnd so, at the end of the season, I think we could look back and say we\u2019ve won more games than we otherwise would have,\" he said, \"because of the way that this roster is now able to come together.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The former Japanese interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani surrendered to a federal prison in Pennsylvania on Monday, beginning a nearly five-year prison sentence for bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers player.",
      "Ippei Mizuhara, 40, was processed at a low security federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, his attorney Michael Freedman confirmed. The facility is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia.",
      "Mizuhara was sentenced in federal court in Santa Ana in February to four years and nine months for bank and tax fraud. He was also ordered to pay $18 million in restitution, with nearly $17 million going to Ohtani and the remainder to the IRS. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 supervised release on top of the prison sentence.",
      "Authorities said Mizuhara began accessing Ohtani\u2019s account beginning in 2021 and changed its security protocols so he could impersonate Ohtani to authorize wire transfers. He has admitted to using the money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, in addition to purchasing $325,000 worth of baseball cards and paying his own dental bills.",
      "He was a close friend and confidant to Ohtani, standing by his side for many of his career highlights, from serving as his catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game, to being there for his two American League MVP wins and his record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Ohtani is set to make his highly anticipated pitching debut Monday night for the Dodgers nearly two years after having elbow surgery.",

      "He hit a 101.5 mph groundout in the first and a 111.1 mph single in the fourth, struck out in the sixth and led off the ninth with a 102.9 mph double.",
      "\u201cI thought he moved well on his double,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cI feel like his timing with the fastball has been good. Now it\u2019s just about continuing to do it over and over and seeing how he bounces back every day.\u201d",
      "Stanton had said in February \u201cthe pain was very high in general\u201d last year because of epicondylitis, a tendon inflammation known as tennis elbow.",
      "Taking early batting practice off a machine in empty Yankee Stadium, he took notice of being on the field he had missed during a layoff that began in the weeks before spring training.",
      "\u201cExcited to get the big boy back,\" Boone said a little later in the interview room.",
      "Batting fifth as the designated hitter, Stanton received a standing ovation from the crowd of 37,398 when he came to the plate with two on and two outs in the first inning.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming for the year, so I appreciate them and good thing I was able to do all right tonight.\u201d",
      "Stanton has not played a full season since 2018, the first year after the Yankees acquired him from the Miami Marlins. Entering Monday, he had missed 364 of 940 games (39%) since the beginning of the 2019 season.",
      "The 35-year-old appeared in 114 games last season, hitting .233 with 27 homers and 72 RBIs, then had seven homers in 14 postseason games and was voted the MVP of the AL Championship Series.",
      "Given a then-record $325 million, 13-year contract by the Marlins, Stanton had 59 homers and 132 RBIs in 2017, winning the NL MVP award. He was traded to the Yankees and had 38 homers and 100 RBIs in his first season in the Bronx.",
      "He missed time because of a strained right biceps and strained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee (2019), strained left hamstring (2020), strained left quadriceps (2021), right ankle inflammation and left Achilles tendinitis (2022) and strained left hamstring (2023 and 2024).",
      "Stanton was activated from the 60-day injured list and infielder/outfielder Pablo Reyes was designated for assignment.",
      "Ben Rice had started 43 games at designated hitter, Aaron Judge 17, Jasson Dom\u00ednguez eight and Paul Goldschmidt two. Rice has 12 homers and could see time catching, where he has made six appearances since his big league debut last June 18, none of them starts.",
      "\u201cWe have, frankly, guys that should be in there probably pretty much every single day and we\u2019ll have to work a little bit of a rotation there,\u201d Boone said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s not going to be happy about it all the time and that\u2019s OK, as long as we\u2019re all in it together as a team.\u201d",
      "Boone said right-hander Jake Cousins will have Tommy John surgery on Wednesday with Texas Rangers team physician Dr. Keith Meister, and right-hander JT Brubaker likely will be activated in the next few days after recovering from three broken left ribs sustained when trying to avoid a comebacker off the bat of Tampa Bay's Kameron Misner during an exhibition on Feb. 21.",
      "Cousins, a right-hander who turns 31 next month, has been sidelined all season. Boone said ahead of the first workout at spring training that Cousins had a strained right forearm and then the pitcher felt a pec issue after a pair of batting practice sessions last month. Cousins made minor league rehab appearances on June 3 and June 7 for High-A Hudson Valley and felt discomfort. He had a 2.37 ERA in 37 relief appearances last year, striking out 53 and walking 20 in 38 innings.",
      "Brubaker was acquired from Pittsburgh in March 2024 while recovering from Tommy John surgery on April 12, 2023. The 31-year-old right-hander made six minor league appearances from May 18 through Saturday, then got a call on Sunday from his rehab coordinator telling him to report to Yankee Stadium. He'll likely be used at first in long relief.",
      "\u201cJust to be able to step in this clubhouse is amazing. I mean, the history, just everything,\u201d Brubaker said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable experience. I got lost a little bit walking around.\u201d",

      "Several eruptions sent ash up to 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon.

      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has sued to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms define and handle problematic posts",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk \u2019s X sued Tuesday to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms handle problematic posts \u2014 a regulatory approach that the company successfully challenged in California.",
      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",
      "New York is improperly trying \u201cto inject itself into the content-moderation editorial process\u201d by requiring \u201cpolitically charged disclosures\u201d about it, Bastrop, Texas-based X Corp. argues in the suit.",
      "\u201cThe state is impermissibly trying to generate public controversy about content moderation in a way that will pressure social media companies, such as X Corp., to restrict, limit, disfavor or censor certain constitutionally protected content on X that the state dislikes,\u201d says the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote before Musk became, for a time, a close adviser and chainsaw-wielding cost-cutter in Republican President Donald Trump's administration. The two billionaires have since feuded and, perhaps, made up.",
      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",
      "The New York legislation took a page from a similar law that passed in California \u2014 and drew a similar lawsuit from X.",
      "Last fall, a panel of federal appellate judges blocked portions of the California law, at least temporarily, on free speech grounds. The state subsequently settled, agreeing not to enforce the content-moderation reporting requirements.",

    "story": [
      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats, known as \u201cVoyagers,\u201d have been put into service by Denmark's armed forces for a three-month operational trial.",
      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",

The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",
      "The trial also unfolds against a backdrop of trans-Atlantic friction \u2014 with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatening to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a NATO member. Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military force to take Greenland.",
      "Jenkins, the founder of Saildrone, noted that his company had already planned to open its operation in Denmark before Trump was reelected. He didn't want to comment on the Greenland matter, insisting the company isn't political.",
      "Some of the maritime disruptions have been blamed on Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet \u2014 aging oil tankers operating under opaque ownership to avoid sanctions. One such vessel, the Eagle S, was seized by Finnish police in December for allegedly damaging a power cable between Finland and Estonia with its anchor.",
      "Western officials accuse Russia of behind behind a string of hybrid war attacks on land and at sea.",
      "Amid these concerns, NATO is moving to build a layered maritime surveillance system combining uncrewed surface vehicles like the Voyagers with traditional naval ships, satellites and seabed sensors.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is that you basically need to be on the water all the time, and it\u2019s humongously expensive,\" said Peter Viggo Jakobsen of the Royal Danish Defense College. \u201cIt\u2019s simply too expensive for us to have a warship trailing every single Russian ship, be it a warship or a civilian freighter of some kind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together a layered system that will enable us to keep constant monitoring of potential threats, but at a much cheaper level than before,\u201d he added.",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them.

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A chartered spaceflight for India, Poland and Hungary\u2019s first astronauts in decades has been delayed indefinitely because of leak concerns at the International Space Station.",
      "NASA said Thursday that it wants to monitor the cabin pressure on the Russian side of the orbiting lab before accepting visitors. Officials stressed that the seven astronauts currently at the space station are safe and that other operations up there aren't affected.",
      "SpaceX was supposed to launch four private astronauts this week on a 14-day space station mission, but bad weather and SpaceX rocket trouble delayed the flight. Then the station leak issue cropped up.",
      "The Russian Space Agency has been dealing with a cabin pressure leak at the station, and recent repairs resulted in what NASA calls \u201ca new pressure signature.\u201d Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "The three Russians aboard the space station recently inspected the inside walls of the aging Zvezda service module, which was launched in 2000. They sealed some areas and measured the current leak rate.",
      "\u201cFollowing this effort, the segment now is holding pressure,\u201d NASA said in an online update.",
      "The private mission's delay provides extra time for NASA and the Russian Space Agency \u201cto evaluate the situation\u201d and determine whether more repairs are needed.",
      "The chartered flight was arranged by the Houston company Axiom Space, and was to be Axiom's fourth trip to the space station with paying customers since 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is the right thing to do,\u201d Axiom Space's executive chairman Kam Ghaffarian said in a written statement. \u201cWe will continue to work with all of our partners to finalize a new launch date.\u201d",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity. Tech companies are now tapping into an older repository of knowledge: the library stacks.",
      "Nearly one million books published as early as the 15th century \u2014 and in 254 languages \u2014 are part of a Harvard University collection being released to AI researchers Thursday. Also coming soon are troves of old newspapers and government documents held by Boston's public library.",
      "Cracking open the vaults to centuries-old tomes could be a data bonanza for tech companies battling lawsuits from living novelists, visual artistsand others whose creative works have been scooped up without their consent to train AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cIt is a prudent decision to start with public domain data because that\u2019s less controversial right now than content that\u2019s still under copyright,\u201d said Burton Davis, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft.",
      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",

      "The legislation aims to create a comprehensive framework for the regulation of digital assets and comes amid a shift in Washington. President Trump, a Republican, has pledged to make the U.S. the global capital of cryptocurrency, contrasting with what industry leaders viewed as a stifling regulatory approach under the previous Democratic administration.",

      "Trump significantly ramped up his rhetoric against the Iranian regime ahead of the meeting, asserting that the U.S. knew exactly where Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was hiding.",
      "\"He is an easy target, but is safe there -- We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin,\" Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,\" he claimed in another post.",
      "Despite the apparent saber rattling, U.S. negotiators on Tuesday continued to assess that Iran is in a weak position and could be forced to come back to the negotiating table and to ultimately accept a deal that would require it abandon all nuclear enrichment, according to multiple officials involved in the diplomatic process.",

      "\"It's our role to keep options on the table, but our posture is still defensive,\" said a U.S. official.",
      "A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers. The heavy strategic bombers are capable of carrying the 30,000 pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bombs, which might be able to destroy Iran's deep underground nuclear facility at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant.",
      "Currently, the military's fleet of 19 B-2 bombers is located at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Six of the aircraft were previously deployed to the airbase on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean -- much closer to Iran. However, they were replaced by B-52 long-range bombers which are not capable of carrying the bunker-buster bombs needed to destroy the Fordo site.",

Among them are a littoral combat ship, four minesweepers, and six water patrol craft, the official said.",

      "On her first day in office in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi lifted a moratorium on federal executions that was imposed under the Biden administration in 2021. Only three defendants remain on federal death row after Biden converted 37 of their sentences to life in prison.",
      "Bondi has since authorized federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in at least three cases, including against Luigi Mangione for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In the other two cases, the Justice Department has said it is seeking the death penalty against defendants charged with killing fellow prison inmates.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration carried out 13 federal executions, more than the administration of any other president in modern history.",
      "The federal intervention in Boelter's case appeared to irritate Moriarty, the county's former chief public defender, who was elected on a police reform and racial justice platform in 2022 after the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "At a news conference Monday to announce the state charges, Moriarty gave only vague answers in response to questions about the interplay between the federal and state investigations. But she acknowledged \u201cthere's a tension\u201d and said federal officials \u201ccan speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "Moriarty said she intends to press forward in state court regardless and to seek an indictment for first-degree murder for the killings of the Hortmans, which would carry a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Tuesday.",
      "As evidence of the tensions, the county attorney refused to clarify how Boelter' first hearings would play out. Court records show that Boelter was called for a first appearance in Hennepin County on Monday and that because he was not there as he was in federal custody, the judge issued a bench warrant as a formality, as requested by prosecutors.",
      "\u201cUsually murder cases are overwhelmingly handled in state courts,\u201d said Mark Osler, a death penalty expert at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. \u201cClearly this is something of national interest. And that seemed to play a role in the decision that the Justice Department is making here.\u201d",
      "Osler, who formerly served as Moriarty\u2019s deputy county attorney and head of her criminal division, as well as assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit, acknowledged that there are often tensions between state and federal prosecutors.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s complicated,\u201d Osler said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to avoid the sense of the older sibling grabbing something away from the younger sibling.\u201d",
      "If federal officials do pursue the death penalty, Osler said, they will face an unusual challenge: \u201ca jury pool drawn from the citizens of a state that has rejected the death penalty for over 100 years. It\u2019s not the same as choosing people in a state where there\u2019s a history of support for the death penalty, such as Texas.\u201d",
      "After his federal court appearance, Boelter was taken to the Sherburne County Jail in suburban Elk River, where federal prisoners are often held.",
      "Thompson told reporters that the federal case \u201cdoes not nullify the state charges. They remain in place. ... My expectation based on prior cases is the federal case, the federal charges, will be litigated first, but the state charges won\u2019t necessarily go anywhere.\u201d",
      "Boelter's next federal court appearance is June 27. He does not have any further appearances scheduled in state court.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a natural competitiveness that occurs sometimes between jurisdictions, but you have to hope that in the end, they\u2019re all facing the same way where there\u2019s something as important to public safety as this case is,\u201d Osler said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill for the last in a series of hearings before lawmakers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for the last in a series of often combative hearings before lawmakers, who have pressed him on everything from a ban on transgender troops to his use of a Signal chat to share sensitive military plans.",
      "The questions \u2014 which also have touched on his firings of top military leaders and even some of his inner circle of advisers \u2014 may be dominated by the escalation of airstrikes between Iran and Israel that threaten a potentially devastating regional war. But he is still expected to face sharp questions about his chaotic tenure, his opposition to women in combat jobs and efforts to shift funding from troop housing to border security.",
      "The U.S. has shifted significant numbers of refueling tanker and fighter aircraft to position them to be able to respond if needed to the conflict, such as possible evacuations or airstrikes. Hegseth said this week that was done to protect U.S. personnel and airbases.",
      "\u201cWe are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that\u2019s what happens here,\" he told Fox News Channel. \u201cAnd America first means we\u2019re going to defend American personnel and American interests.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's testimony last week in three congressional hearings also was taken over by events, with the Trump administration dispatching the National Guard and 700 active-duty Marines to the protests in Los Angeles against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. It came just ahead of a massive military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, which coincided with President Donald Trump's birthday.",
      "In the previous hearings \u2014 where Hegseth was appearing to discuss the Pentagon's spending plan \u2014 lawmakers made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided full details on the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget.",
      "Trump has said it would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.",
      "Hegseth, who is appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, has spent vast amounts of time during his first months in office promoting the social changes he\u2019s making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.",
      "For example, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. He also has touted other moves to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and said a ban on transgender troops in the military was a way to regain the \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d",
      "It will be Hegseth's first time before some senators since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Trump Cabinet member.",
      "While he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.",
      "Set up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat that included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders was used to share information about upcoming military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "The chat came to light because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in that chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.",
      "The Pentagon's watchdog is looking into Hegseth's use of Signal and expected to issue a report soon.",

      "Trump swatted down Carlson's comments, calling him \"Kooky\" in a post on Truth Social and telling reporters Carlson should \"get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",
      "But other leading MAGA voices are weighing in, including an exceedingly rare comment from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pushing back on Trump's jab at Carlson without naming him, writing in a lengthy post that Carlson's comments regarding Iran are \"not kooky.\"",
      "\"Tucker Carlson is one of my favorite people. He fiercely loves his wife, children, and our country. Since being fired by the neocon network Fox News, he has more popularity and viewers than ever before. He unapologetically believes the same things I do. That if we don't fight for our own country and our own people then we will no longer have a country for our children and our grandchildren. And foreign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction. That's not kooky. That's what millions of Americans voted for. It's what we believe is America First,\" she wrote.",
      "Greene also appeared on longtime Trump ally and former Rep. Matt Gaetz's show on Monday, and the pair both urged the president to \"reject\" calls to join the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "Asked Tuesday on Capitol Hill if his post was directed specifically at conservatives or those who usually support the MAGA movement, Vance said it was \"not targeted at any particular demographic of the country\" and was directed toward \"everybody who is interested.\"",
      "The vice president said he wrote the post to help Americans understand why the administration is so focused on Iran.",
      "\"I just wanted to explain to the American people, if you want safety, part of safety, and I think all Americans want that, is ensuring that the worst people in the world don't have a nuclear bomb. And part of ensuring that they don't have a nuclear bomb is ensuring that they don't have the enrichment capacity to get there. I just kind of wanted to lay that out and sot of explain why we're talking about this issue and why the President is so focused on this question,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance didn't directly answer questions about whether the U.S. will strike Iran as he was leaving a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans about Trump's megabill, but he repeatedly reiterated the president's policy position that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon or enriched uranium.",
      "\"It's so bizarre to me that the Iranians seem confused about what's going on,\" Vance said. \"The president has been as clear as possible for as long as possible that part of his no-nuclear policy is Iranians are not allowed to have enrichment in their country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Texas has stopped providing new funding toward building a U.S.-Mexico border wall after lawmakers quietly approved a new budget that does not include funding for the project",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has stopped putting new money toward building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting course after installing only a fraction of the hundreds of miles of potential barrier that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott set out to construct four years ago.",
      "State lawmakers this month approved a new Texas budget that does not include continued funding for the wall, which had been a multibillion-dollar priority for Abbott as part of a sprawling immigration crackdown. He even took the unusual step of soliciting private donations for construction, saying in 2021 that many Americans wanted to help.",
      "On Tuesday, Abbott's office said President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to curb immigration allowed the state to adjust.",
      "The halt in funding was first reported by The Texas Tribune.",
      "\u201cThanks to President Trump\u2019s bold leadership, the federal government is finally fulfilling its obligation to secure the southern border and deport criminal illegal immigrants,\" Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said. \u201cBecause of these renewed federal assets in Texas, our state can now adjust aspects of state-funded border security efforts.\u201d",
      "The state has completed 65 miles (104 kilometers) of border wall since construction began. The Texas border with Mexico is roughly 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers).",
      "The wall has gone up at a slow pace as the state has navigated the drawn-out process of buying private land and confronting local opposition in some places. Abbott announced plans for the wall at a time when large numbers of migrants were showing up at the border, saying in 2021 that he believed a combination of state-owned land and volunteered private property would \"yield hundreds of miles to build a border wall.'",
      "The number of migrant crossings has fallen dramatically this year.",
      "\u201cThere was no need for it in the first place,\u201d said Scott Nicol, a board member for Friends of the Wildlife Corridor, a habitat preservation group in the Rio Grande Valley. He has criticized the wall as ineffective.",
      "\"The only thing that\u2019s changed is the political dynamic,\u201d he said.",
      "The new budget approved by Texas lawmakers allocates about $3.4 billion for border security for two years. That amount will not be used to build out new projects for the wall and instead go to the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard, the main agencies responsible for Operation Lone Star, Abbott's key immigration program launched in 2021 during the Biden administration.",
      "The money allocated for border security is nearly half the $6.5 billion that was dedicated to immigration efforts the last time lawmakers earmarked the state budget two years ago.",
      "Funds previously allocated for the wall will allow work on it to continue through 2026 and \u201cwill set the federal government up for success,\u201d said Republican Sen. Joan Huffman, the lead budget writer in the state Senate.",
      "The agency responsible for constructing the wall has about $2.5 billion remaining in funding to cover up to 85 additional miles (85 additional kilometers) of the wall by 2026, according to a statement made in April by Texas Facilities Commission executive director Mike Novak, whose agency is overseeing construction of the project.",
      "\u201cThis wall should have never been built, it\u2019s useless,\u201d said Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network. \"It divides our community.\u201d",

    "summary": "New York City voters voting in the city's Democratic mayoral primary election will be able to rank their top five candidates thanks to ranked-choice voting.",
    "story": [
      "Ranked-choice voting has formed some unusual alliances between candidates.",
      "New Yorkers voting in the city's closely-watched Democratic mayoral primary election on June 24 will be able to rank their top five candidates thanks to ranked-choice voting -- and that's set the scene for candidates on the ballot, who are ostensibly rivals, telling their supporters to vote for each other.",
      "On their ballot, voters can rank up to five candidates in any order. Ranking one candidate in two spots, though, does not give that candidate two votes.",
      "According to the New York City Board of Elections, if a candidate gets over 50% of the first-choice votes, that candidate wins the race outright.",
      "If no candidate breaks 50%, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and vote tabulation continues in rounds. In the second round, voters whose first-choice candidate got eliminated get their second-choice vote counted. If that voter's first-choice candidate was not eliminated, their second-choice vote is not counted.",
      "This keeps going until only two candidates remain, according to the board, and the candidate in the lead at that point wins the primary.",
      "New York City first used ranked-choice voting citywide in the 2021 municipal primary elections.",
      "Advocates of ranked choice voting have praised it as allowing voters to have more choices. FairVote, a nonpartisan group advocating for ranked-choice voting, has praised how it allows more positive campaigns and collaboration between candidates.",
      "Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic political strategist, told ABC News that ranked-choice voting might be \"confusing\" to voters who are not used to it.",
      "\"Voting is habitual and ritualistic. Changing the system benefits the more educated and affluent while injuring others,\" he said.",
      "Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates, some candidates have been able to form unusual alliances with each other -- including telling their supporters to rank each other.",
      "Two of the progressive-leaning mayoral candidates \u2013 state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and city comptroller Brad Lander -- announced on Friday that they are cross-endorsing each other in what they said is an effort to stop former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from winning the race.",
      "\"The core reason, I think, is it it significantly increases the chances of Andrew Cuomo not winning \u2026 If you have somebody leading in the polls, and the number-two and -three candidates agree that that person is unacceptable, teaming up dramatically increases their chances,\" Lander said at an event on Friday with Mamdani.",
      "Sheinkopf said that the cross-endorsements by progressive candidates such as Mamdani and Lander are ultimately meant to limit the amount of votes Cuomo can get, although he feels that the cross-endorsements also amount to \"making deals to win without telling voters what the deals could cost should any of the dealers win.\"",
      "Many organizations have also endorsed multiple candidates, sometimes telling supporters the order in which to rank them. Some organizations, such as the New York Working Families Party, have sounded a similar tone to Lander and Mamdani, saying that voters should rank the group's endorsed candidates and not rank Cuomo at all.",
      "The Cuomo campaign has shrugged off the cross-endorsements and calls from groups to not rank the former governor.",
      "\"We are running our campaign, they are running theirs -- ultimately the voters will decide,\" Esther Jensen, a spokesperson for the Cuomo campaign, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Cuomo has support from two other mayoral candidates, although they are not cross-endorsements.",
      "Mayoral candidate and state Sen. Jessica Ramos has fully endorsed Cuomo and effectively suspended her campaign, although she will still be on the ballot. Separately, mayoral candidate and former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said at the second mayoral primary debate that he will rank Cuomo second on his ballot.",
      "On Monday, Mamdani and another former assembly member on the ballot, Michael Blake, also announced that they would cross-endorse each other in the race.",
      "While the primary is Tuesday, June 24, fuller results won't be reported until a week later, on July 1. Instead, the city's election board expects to provide preliminary totals for voters' first-choice votes on June 24 after polls close, and then run the ranked-choice tabulation on July 1.",
      "Part of the delay can be attributed to the complex nature of collecting and tabulating the results of ranked-choice ballots, especially if no candidate crosses the 50% threshold needed to win on the first round. Polls have shown no candidate winning outright on the first round.",
      "A spokesperson for the New York City Board of Elections, Vincent Ignizio, recently told POLITICO, \"We're not going to exchange speed for accuracy.\"",

      "A Sunday evening at home with her children took a dark turn for Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Scholten when she says state police delivered the horrifying news that she was on a suspected killer's alleged target list.",
      "\"It was truly chilling,\" Scholten told ABC News on Tuesday, describing the moment she says authorities told her she was among 45 people targeted by the suspect accused of killing Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home on Saturday.",
      "The 57-year-old suspected gunman, Vance Boelter, allegedly maintained detailed surveillance notes on his intended victims, including Democratic politicians, abortion-rights advocates and healthcare officials, according to law enforcement sources.",
      "Boelter is also accused of wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Before the fatal shooting at Hortman's home, authorities say he had already attempted to reach two other lawmakers who weren't at their residences.",
      "For Scholten, a mother of two boys, her first instinct was to be protective.",
      "\"As a mom, my first instinct, of course, was to protect my two boys who were at home with me,\" she said.",
      "Scholten told ABC News that local law enforcement responded immediately and stationed troopers outside her home around the clock while the suspect remained at large in a nearby state. She also wants answers to why she was on Boelter's alleged list.",
      "\"You know, I think that's one of the things we're still trying to figure out, and that we are really pushing the FBI and the Capitol Police to get us answers to,\" Scholten said.",
      "\"We will not be intimidated or silenced by an individual like this,\" Scholten said. \"As the first woman in history to do this job, I feel that it is so important to, yes, always be smart and safe, but to continue to push back against this type of violence.\"",
      "While most lawmakers have condemned the shooting. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee posted images about the suspect with the caption, \"Nightmare on Waltz Street\" -- an apparent reference to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "\"Shame, shame on you. Senator, you know better than that,\" Scholten told ABC News. \"We are talking about a fellow public servant who was killed because of the job that she chose to do; he should immediately take down these horrific and offensive posts and apologize for them. I also hope that my Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate will condemn these actions.\"",
      "Lee ignored questions from reporters about the posts at the Capitol Monday night, and deleted the posts on Tuesday.",
      "Scholten told ABC News she has faced threats before and emphasized the need for bipartisan condemnation of political violence.",
      "\"We need to come together, regardless of party, when this type of violence raises its head and condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\" she said, noting that Democratic lawmakers united in condemning violence when Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise was shot in 2017.",
      "Despite postponing a town hall meeting due to safety concerns, Scholten said she is determined to continue her work.",
      "\"I'm making it very clear we're not going to stop this work,\" she said, characterizing such threats as \"true domestic terrorism\" aimed at silencing lawmakers from serving their constituents.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",

      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",

      "Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, and the state's last execution was a botched hanging in 1906. But federal prosecutors announced charges against Vance Boelter on Monday that can carry the death penalty.",
      "It\u2019s not unheard of for state and federal prosecutors to both pursue criminal cases for the same offense, especially in high-profile matters.",
      "In this case federal authorities essentially grabbed the lead from the state prosecutor, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty. Boelter had been scheduled to make his first court appearance on state charges Monday, but instead marshals took him from the county jail to the U.S. courthouse in St. Paul, where he appeared on the more serious federal charges.",
      "Boelter is accused of fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Before that, authorities say, he also shot and wounded another Democrat, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, who lived a few miles away. He surrendered Sunday night after what authorities have called the largest search in Minnesota history.",

That is one of the options,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Monday at a news conference where he revealed new details of what he described as a meticulously planned attack. They included allegations that Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other lawmakers that night and had dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states.",
      "Boelter\u2019s federal defenders have declined to comment on the case, and he has not entered a plea.",
      "On her first day in office in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi lifted a moratorium on federal executions that was imposed under the Biden administration in 2021. Only three defendants remain on federal death row after Biden converted 37 of their sentences to life in prison.",
      "Bondi has since authorized federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in at least three cases, including against Luigi Mangione for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In the other two cases, the Justice Department has said it is seeking the death penalty against defendants charged with killing fellow prison inmates.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration carried out 13 federal executions, more than the administration of any other president in modern history.",
      "The federal intervention in Boelter's case appeared to irritate Moriarty, the county's former chief public defender, who was elected on a police reform and racial justice platform in 2022 after the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "At a news conference Monday to announce the state charges, Moriarty gave only vague answers in response to questions about the interplay between the federal and state investigations. But she acknowledged \u201cthere's a tension\u201d and said federal officials \u201ccan speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "Moriarty said she intends to press forward in state court regardless and to seek an indictment for first-degree murder for the killings of the Hortmans, which would carry a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Tuesday.",
      "As evidence of the tensions, the county attorney refused to clarify how Boelter' first hearings would play out. Court records show that Boelter was called for a first appearance in Hennepin County on Monday and that because he was not there as he was in federal custody, the judge issued a bench warrant as a formality, as requested by prosecutors.",
      "\u201cUsually murder cases are overwhelmingly handled in state courts,\u201d said Mark Osler, a death penalty expert at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. \u201cClearly this is something of national interest. And that seemed to play a role in the decision that the Justice Department is making here.\u201d",
      "Osler, who formerly served as Moriarty\u2019s deputy county attorney and head of her criminal division, as well as assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit, acknowledged that there are often tensions between state and federal prosecutors.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s complicated,\u201d Osler said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to avoid the sense of the older sibling grabbing something away from the younger sibling.\u201d",
      "If federal officials do pursue the death penalty, Osler said, they will face an unusual challenge: \u201ca jury pool drawn from the citizens of a state that has rejected the death penalty for over 100 years. It\u2019s not the same as choosing people in a state where there\u2019s a history of support for the death penalty, such as Texas.\u201d",
      "After his federal court appearance, Boelter was taken to the Sherburne County Jail in suburban Elk River, where federal prisoners are often held.",
      "Thompson told reporters that the federal case \u201cdoes not nullify the state charges. They remain in place. ... My expectation based on prior cases is the federal case, the federal charges, will be litigated first, but the state charges won\u2019t necessarily go anywhere.\u201d",
      "Boelter's next federal court appearance is June 27. He does not have any further appearances scheduled in state court.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a natural competitiveness that occurs sometimes between jurisdictions, but you have to hope that in the end, they\u2019re all facing the same way where there\u2019s something as important to public safety as this case is,\u201d Osler said.",

      "With jury selection expected to begin in less than six weeks, the judge handling Bryan Kohberger\u2019s quadruple murder trial is again weighing a request to delay the proceedings",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- With jury selection less than six weeks away, the trial in the stabbing deaths of four university students in Idaho could be delayed again as defense attorneys argue they need more time to prepare and that intense publicity has threatened Bryan Kohberger's right to a fair trial.",
      "Judge Steven Hippler will hear arguments Wednesday on the request. He is also expected to consider, in a closed session, whether the defense can present evidence of possible alternate suspects.",
      "Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at nearby Washington State University, is charged with sneaking into into a rental home near the University of Idaho campus and fatally stabbing Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "Kohberger stood silent at his arraignment, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Defense attorney Anne Taylor wrote in a motion last month that proceeding with an August trial date would violate Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights. She said the defense needs more time to review discovery, complete investigations and prepare mitigating evidence that could be presented if the case reaches the penalty phase.",
      "Taylor emphasized that in a death penalty case, the jury must consider any factor from a defendant\u2019s life history that might weigh against executing them. \u201cThis process is a comprehensive, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut it is also what our Constitution demands when the government seeks to extinguish human life.\u201d",
      "Latah County prosecutors, led by Bill Thompson, argued against the defense team\u2019s \u201celeventh-hour motion.\u201d In a court filling this month, Thompson noted Kohberger has three defense attorneys, a public defender and a team of experts, investigators and a mitigation specialist.",
      "He said the request for more time has \u201cno end in sight\u201d and that beginning the trial as scheduled wouldn't violate his right to a mitigation case that passes constitutional muster.",
      "The killings in Moscow, Idaho, drew worldwide attention almost immediately, prompting a judge to issue a sweeping gag order that bars attorneys, investigators and others from speaking publicly about the investigation or trial. The trial was moved to Boise to gather a larger jury pool and the judge has sealed many case documents.",
      "It's all being done to limit potential juror's pretrial bias. Still, public interest remains high.",
      "A recent Dateline episode included details that weren't publicly released, and Hippler said the information appears to have come from law enforcement or someone close to the case.",
      "That's another reason to delay the trial, Kohberger's attorneys have argued.",
      "\u201cThe leaked materials appear carefully curated to promote a narrative of guilt,\u201d Taylor wrote. That raises serious concerns about the objectivity of investigators, especially if the source of the leak could be called as a witness.",
      "The defense has asked the judge to appoint a special investigator to identify the leaker, and prosecutors said they will cooperate. But Thompson argued that pretrial publicity alone is not reason enough to delay the case.",
      "\u201cThe question of whether Defendant can receive a fair trial is not answered by the amount of and the nature of pretrial publicity,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, it depends on whether a fair and impartial jury can be seated.\u201d",
      "He said anyone influenced by the coverage, including the Dateline episode, will be screened out during jury selection.",
      "The attention isn't likely to end soon. A book about the killings by James Patterson is set to be released in July. And a \u201cdocu-series\u201d centered on the morning the deaths were discovered is expected to air on Amazon Prime next month, and includes interviews with some of the victims' family members and friends.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill for the last in a series of hearings before lawmakers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for the last in a series of often combative hearings before lawmakers, who have pressed him on everything from a ban on transgender troops to his use of a Signal chat to share sensitive military plans.",
      "The questions \u2014 which also have touched on his firings of top military leaders and even some of his inner circle of advisers \u2014 may be dominated by the escalation of airstrikes between Iran and Israel that threaten a potentially devastating regional war. But he is still expected to face sharp questions about his chaotic tenure, his opposition to women in combat jobs and efforts to shift funding from troop housing to border security.",
      "The U.S. has shifted significant numbers of refueling tanker and fighter aircraft to position them to be able to respond if needed to the conflict, such as possible evacuations or airstrikes. Hegseth said this week that was done to protect U.S. personnel and airbases.",
      "\u201cWe are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that\u2019s what happens here,\" he told Fox News Channel. \u201cAnd America first means we\u2019re going to defend American personnel and American interests.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's testimony last week in three congressional hearings also was taken over by events, with the Trump administration dispatching the National Guard and 700 active-duty Marines to the protests in Los Angeles against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. It came just ahead of a massive military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, which coincided with President Donald Trump's birthday.",
      "In the previous hearings \u2014 where Hegseth was appearing to discuss the Pentagon's spending plan \u2014 lawmakers made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided full details on the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget.",
      "Trump has said it would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.",
      "Hegseth, who is appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, has spent vast amounts of time during his first months in office promoting the social changes he\u2019s making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.",
      "For example, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. He also has touted other moves to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and said a ban on transgender troops in the military was a way to regain the \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d",
      "It will be Hegseth's first time before some senators since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Trump Cabinet member.",
      "While he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.",
      "Set up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat that included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders was used to share information about upcoming military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "The chat came to light because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in that chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.",
      "The Pentagon's watchdog is looking into Hegseth's use of Signal and expected to issue a report soon.",

      "The jury is set to return for its third full day of testimony in the second murder trial of Karen Read, who is charged with killing her Boston police officer boyfriend",
      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- The jury is set to return for its third full day of testimony Wednesday in the second murder trial of Karen Read, who is charged with killing her Boston police officer boyfriend.",
      "Jurors began deliberations late last week, more than a month after the trial started. Tuesday's deliberations included several questions to the judge that concerned charges and evidence.",
      "Read, 45, is accused of striking John O\u2019Keefe with her car outside a suburban Boston house party and leaving him to die in the snow in January 2022. She has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene.",
      "Read's lawyers say O\u2019Keefe, 46, was beaten, bitten by a dog and then left outside a home in Canton in a conspiracy orchestrated by police that included planting evidence against Read.",
      "Read's second trial followed similar contours to the first, which ended in a mistrial last year.",
      "The jury asked questions of Judge Beverly Cannone, who also oversaw the first Read trial, on Tuesday. Both sides discussed the questions in open court.",
      "The first question related to the time frame of charge of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. Prosecutors wanted Cannone to instruct the jury to consider a time of 12:45 a.m., while the defense didn\u2019t want a time specified. The defense argued during the trial that Read returned home and kept drinking, which would have influenced her blood alcohol level. Cannone said she would advise the jury that they are the finders of fact and to make their own decision based on the evidence.",
      "On the second question, the jury asked whether video clips of interviews Read did in a documentary that were presented at the trial constituted evidence. The judge advised that they were.",
      "The third question pertained to the jury slip, specifically whether a guilty verdict on a lesser charge of driving under the influence meant guilt on the main charge, which is manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence. The defense argued that amendments should be made in the jury slip.",
      "Cannone returned to the courtroom with the jury present and answered the three questions, emphasizing this was their case to decide.",
      "\u201cYou folks have all the evidence. It\u2019s only you who decides the facts in this case. You are the fact finders,\u201d she said.",
      "After a break the jury returned a fourth question to Cannone, asking if they found Read not guilty on two charges but couldn\u2019t agree on the third charge, would it be a hung jury on all three charges? Cannone said she would respond to the jury that the question was theoretical and not one she could answer.",
      "The defense has said several jurors from the first trial came forward and said the jury was set to acquit Read of two charges but deadlocked on a third, leading to the mistrial.",
      "Defense attorney Alan Jackson began his closing argument Friday by repeating three times: \u201cThere was no collision.\u201d He told the jury that Read is an innocent woman victimized by a police cover-up in which officers sought to protect their own and obscure the real killer.",
      "Prosecutor Hank Brennan opened his own closing by saying Read callously decided to leave O\u2019Keefe dying in the snow, fully aware that he was gravely injured. He argued that she made the \u201cchoice to let\u201d hiom die, going further than prosecutors in the first trial in spelling out a motive.",
      "Jackson repeatedly attacked the lead investigator in the case, former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, who was fired after sharing offensive and sexist texts about Read with friends, family and co-workers. He said Proctor's \u201cblatant bias\u201d tainted every aspect of a corrupt and flawed investigation and noted how prosecutors refused to put him on the stand, as they did during the first trial.",
      "Brennan said Read's blood alcohol level was two to three times the legal limit after the couple downed multiple drinks at two Canton bars. The couple, whose \u201ctoxic\u201d relationship was \u201ccrumbling,\u201d had an argument on the way to the house party that increased tensions and ultimately led to O'Keefe's death, the prosecutor said.",
      "Read faces several charges, the most serious being second-degree murder. If convicted she would face a maximum sentence of life in prison. She also faces a charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence, which carries a maximum of 20 years.",
      "She is also charged with involuntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum of 20 years; motor vehicle homicide, which carries a maximum of 15 years; as well as operating under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. They carry maximum sentences of 2 1/2 and 15 years, respectively.",

      "Texas has stopped providing new funding toward building a U.S.-Mexico border wall after lawmakers quietly approved a new budget that does not include funding for the project",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has stopped putting new money toward building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting course after installing only a fraction of the hundreds of miles of potential barrier that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott set out to construct four years ago.",
      "State lawmakers this month approved a new Texas budget that does not include continued funding for the wall, which had been a multibillion-dollar priority for Abbott as part of a sprawling immigration crackdown. He even took the unusual step of soliciting private donations for construction, saying in 2021 that many Americans wanted to help.",
      "On Tuesday, Abbott's office said President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to curb immigration allowed the state to adjust.",
      "The halt in funding was first reported by The Texas Tribune.",
      "\u201cThanks to President Trump\u2019s bold leadership, the federal government is finally fulfilling its obligation to secure the southern border and deport criminal illegal immigrants,\" Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said. \u201cBecause of these renewed federal assets in Texas, our state can now adjust aspects of state-funded border security efforts.\u201d",
      "The state has completed 65 miles (104 kilometers) of border wall since construction began. The Texas border with Mexico is roughly 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers).",
      "The wall has gone up at a slow pace as the state has navigated the drawn-out process of buying private land and confronting local opposition in some places. Abbott announced plans for the wall at a time when large numbers of migrants were showing up at the border, saying in 2021 that he believed a combination of state-owned land and volunteered private property would \"yield hundreds of miles to build a border wall.'",
      "The number of migrant crossings has fallen dramatically this year.",
      "\u201cThere was no need for it in the first place,\u201d said Scott Nicol, a board member for Friends of the Wildlife Corridor, a habitat preservation group in the Rio Grande Valley. He has criticized the wall as ineffective.",
      "\"The only thing that\u2019s changed is the political dynamic,\u201d he said.",
      "The new budget approved by Texas lawmakers allocates about $3.4 billion for border security for two years. That amount will not be used to build out new projects for the wall and instead go to the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard, the main agencies responsible for Operation Lone Star, Abbott's key immigration program launched in 2021 during the Biden administration.",
      "The money allocated for border security is nearly half the $6.5 billion that was dedicated to immigration efforts the last time lawmakers earmarked the state budget two years ago.",
      "Funds previously allocated for the wall will allow work on it to continue through 2026 and \u201cwill set the federal government up for success,\u201d said Republican Sen. Joan Huffman, the lead budget writer in the state Senate.",
      "The agency responsible for constructing the wall has about $2.5 billion remaining in funding to cover up to 85 additional miles (85 additional kilometers) of the wall by 2026, according to a statement made in April by Texas Facilities Commission executive director Mike Novak, whose agency is overseeing construction of the project.",
      "\u201cThis wall should have never been built, it\u2019s useless,\u201d said Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network. \"It divides our community.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A lifelong friend of the alleged Minnesota gunman says Vance Boelter had been struggling to find work and was wrestling with a \u201cdarkness that was inside of him\u201d at the time of the shootings",
      "Hours after the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers over the weekend, authorities asked David Carlson to identify his lifelong friend in a harrowing photograph.",
      "Carlson says he had known and trusted Vance Boelter from the time the two played together as children. But he barely recognized the 57-year-old in the surveillance image police showed him of Boelter wearing a flesh-colored mask as he carried out what authorities described as a political rampage.",
      "\u201cThe guy with the mask, I don\u2019t know that guy,\u201d Carlson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, recounting his decades-long friendship with a man he likened to a brother. Boelter's involvement in such an attack, he said, was as surprising to him as \u201cgetting struck by lightning.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a darkness that was inside of him,\" Carlson said. \"He must have kept it hidden.\"",
      "As authorities piece together Boelter's movements and motivations, Carlson and others are conducting their own inventory of their interactions with the one-time pastor, wondering whether they missed any red flags.",
      "Boelter is a married father of five but often stayed at Carlson's home in Minneapolis to shorten his commute to work. In hindsight, Carlson said, Boelter \u201cwas a sick man\u201d and needed help, even if those around him didn't realize it in time.",
      "Law enforcement has cautioned the motive could be more complex than pundits might prefer, even as Boelter's own disjointed writings suggest he was hell-bent on targeting Democrats.",
      "Boelter has been charged with federal murder and stalking, along with state counts, in the fatal shootings of former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. He is also accused of wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.",
      "At the time of the shootings, Carlson said Boelter had been struggling to find work and was \u201cdisappointed\u201d he wasn\u2019t hearing back from people.",
      "In February, Boelter abruptly quit his job delivering bodies from assisted living facilities to a funeral home and returned for several weeks to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a mistake for him to quit his job,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to get anywhere with the Congo.\u201d",
      "But the life change was in keeping with Boelter\u2019s impetuous \u201cmentality to always go to the extreme,\u201d Carlson said, recalling a time in the 1990s when Boelter was captured by security forces after sneaking into Gaza to preach Christianity on a trip to Israel. \u201cThat\u2019s how crazy Vance is,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d",
      "Years earlier, after becoming a Christian, Boelter \u201cburned all of his belongings,\u201d Carlson said, including karate and martial arts weapons and anything else that distracted from his religion.",
      "Boelter graduated in 1990 from an interdenominational Bible college in Dallas, earning a diploma in practical theology in leadership. The Christ For The Nations Institute said in a statement it was \u201caghast and horrified\" to learn the suspect was among its alumni, saying \u201cthis is not who we are.\u201d",
      "The church Boelter attended outside Minneapolis has not responded to emails from AP but issued a similar statement condemning the shootings as \u201cthe opposite of what Jesus taught his followers to do.\u201d",
      "Boelter, who worked as a security contractor, offered a glimpse of his opposition to abortion in a 2023 sermon he gave in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saying \"they don\u2019t know abortion is wrong in many churches.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a radical cultist,\" Carlson said. \u201cHe was just a regular Christian and kind of outspoken.\u201d",
      "Boelter was unrestrained when it came to his distaste for Democrats, Carlson said, but that rhetoric never seemed threatening. Carlson and another friend, Paul Schroeder, told AP they never heard Boelter talk about abortion or any of the officials who were targeted.",
      "The FBI said Boelter \u201cmade lists containing the names and home addresses of many Minnesota public officials, mostly or all Democrats.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018We gotta stop them, man,\u2019\u201d Carlson said. \u201cBut it chills me to think he was in his room writing that stuff in my house.\u201d",
      "Boelter would go to a shooting range occasionally but was not fanatical about firearms, another friend, Paul Shroeder said.",
      "\u201cI thought he was just collecting them for self-defense,\" Carlson said. \"It was 1,000 miles away from stalking people and killing them.\u201d",
      "Carlson said he awoke Saturday to an alarming text message from Boelter, who warned he was \u201cgoing to be gone for a while,\u201d and \u201cmay be dead shortly.\u201d Carlson initially thought his friend was suicidal and went to check his room.",
      "He said he was so concerned he called police, who \u201cat first didn\u2019t seem too interested\" before quickly connecting the messages to the shootings.",
      "\u201cWhy throw your whole life away? God, he\u2019s so stupid,\" Carlson said. \"He had everything.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- A senior Cuban diplomat has accused the Trump administration of trying to discredit the thousands of Cuban doctors working around the world and deprive the country of an important source of income.",
      "Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, who was at U.N. headquarters this week for a debate on sanctions, told The Associated Press that the U.S. is putting pressure on other countries and financial institutions to break their ties with Cuba.",
      "Cossio said over the decades Cuba has sent more than 100,000 doctors to more than 70 countries to provide much needed medical care. More than 22,000 doctors are now working in more than 50 countries, according to the government.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has described the program as \u201cforced labor.\u201d He announced visa restrictions in late February on Cuban and foreign government officials involved in Cuba\u2019s medical missions. In June, the Trump administration imposed visa restrictions on several unidentified officials from Central America for their involvement with the Cuban program.",
      "And in a letter obtained by AP last week, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked the 34 members of the Organization of American States for details of any agreements with Cuba for medical missions. It specifically requested information on whether the medical workers have labor and union rights, and about any labor complaints.",
      "The commission, an independent body of the OAS, which is heavily funded by the United States, said it would analyze the data and make recommendations, \u201cgiven the persistence of reports of rights violations.\u201d",
      "The State Department said Tuesday it was pleased its action \u201chas prompted meaningful discussion of this exploitative labor export program after years of denial.\u201d It said the U.S. will not stop raising these issues until Cuba curtails the \u201cforced labor\u201d of its own citizens.",
      "Cossio defended the program in an interview on Monday. He said all Cuban doctors working abroad receive their regular salary, plus \u201ca dignified stipend.\u201d",
      "Starting about 15 years ago, he said, Cuba began receiving compensation from wealthier countries for providing the doctors. That money covers the stipends, with the rest going to finance Cuba\u2019s public health system, he said.",
      "Cossio accused the United States of trying to discredit the medical missions, first by saying that Cuba was not sending doctors but agents to \u201csubvert\u201d these counties. He said the U.S. then accused Cuba of human trafficking and put pressure on the countries that have agreements with Cuba to refuse any future medical missions.",
      "He said the U.S. wanted to stop the praise Cuba has received for sending doctors to many poor and developing countries and to deprive Cuba of a \"legitimate source of income.\u201d Cossio said Cuba would not break its agreements.",
      "Cossio also criticized the Trump administration for reversing a U.S. policy of welcoming Cubans into the country.",
      "The administration has started cracking down on Cubans who have entered the U.S. since October 2022 on two-year permits to live and work, a Biden administration program known as humanitarian parole. President Donald Trump this month also announced additional restrictions on visitors from Cuba, among other countries.",
      "The restrictions have come as a shock to the 2.4 million Cuban-Americans. They strongly backed the Republican president in both elections and have long enjoyed a place of privilege in the U.S. immigration system.",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from limiting passport sex markers for many transgender and nonbinary Americans",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from limiting passport sex markers for many transgender and nonbinary Americans.",
      "Tuesday's ruling from U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick means that transgender or nonbinary people who are without a passport or need to apply for a new one can request a male, female or \u201cX\u201d identification marker rather than being limited to the marker that matches the gender assigned at birth.",
      "In an executive order signed in January, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order said a person is male or female and rejected the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender.",
      "Kobick first issued a preliminary injunction against the policy last month, but that ruling applied only to six people who joined with the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit over the passport policy.",
      "In Tuesday's ruling she agreed to expand the injunction to include transgender or nonbinary people who are currently without a valid passport, those whose passport is expiring within a year, and those who need to apply for a passport because theirs was lost or stolen or because they need to change their name or sex designation.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The government failed to show that blocking its policy would cause it any constitutional injury, Kobick wrote, or harm the executive branch\u2019s relations with other countries.",
      "The transgender and nonbinary people covered by the preliminary injunction, meanwhile, have shown that the passport policy violates their constitutional rights to equal protection, Kobick said.",
      "\u201cEven assuming a preliminary injunction inflicts some constitutional harm on the Executive Branch, such harm is the consequence of the State Department\u2019s adoption of a Passport Policy that likely violates the constitutional rights of thousands of Americans,\u201d Kobick wrote.",
      "Kobick, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, sided with the ACLU's motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.",
      "\u201cThe Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,\u201d Kobick wrote in the preliminary injunction issued earlier this year. \u201cThat standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. The government has failed to meet this standard.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, the ACLU described how one woman had her passport returned with a male designation while others are too scared to submit their passports because they fear their applications might be suspended and their passports held by the State Department.",
      "Another mailed in their passport Jan. 9 and requested to change their name and their sex designation from male to female. That person was still waiting for their passport, the ACLU said in the lawsuit, and feared missing a family wedding and a botany conference this year.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration argued that the passport policy change \u201cdoes not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.\u201d It also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed since they are still free to travel abroad.",

      "On that horrible night in 2015, nine Black church members were gunned down by a white man who hated them just for the color of their skin. He sat with them through their Bible study, then as they closed their eyes and bowed their heads, he started firing.",
      "As survivors gathered in 2025, they invited another congregation that knows the pain of murderous hatred to join them. When a gunman killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, Mother Emanuel's pastor, the Rev. Eric Manning, flew to Pittsburgh to comfort another flock.",
      "It was up to Rabbi Jeff Myers to lament Tuesday that the world hasn't changed as much as was hoped by the congregation of the South\u2019s oldest African American church, which was founded by enslaved people, torn down after they rebelled and then rebuilt following the Civil War.",
      "\u201cBoth of us were assaulted by Americans who did not want us to exist, who thought violence would solve their problems,\u201d Myers said.",

      "The Charleston church massacre did change the world in some ways.",
      "The shooter, now on death row just like the killer at Tree of Life, posted selfie photos with a Confederate flag to hammer home his racist reasons for shooting Black parishioners. For many, this act made it impossible to keep defending the rebel banner as a symbol of southern heritage. South Carolina then took the flag down from the Statehouse grounds where it was installed as a rebuttal to federal desegregation orders.",
      "But some things are the same. Mother Emanuel's sanctuary still has the same deep red carpet. The church continues its mission of empathy, empowerment, encouragement and equipping.",
      "And the nation still struggles with the legacy of enslaving Black people for hundreds of years.",
      "South Carolina remains one of only two states in the U.S. without a hate crime law even though survivors keep pushing for it. Months before the massacre at Mother Emanuel, a white North Charleston police officer shot and killed an unarmed Black man in the back about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away. Six years later, a white officer knelt on a Black man's neck in Minnesota for nine minutes, killing him.",
      "\u201cOn paper, the concept of the United States is a wonderful one. In reality, it is not successful right now,\u201d Rabbi Myers said.",
      "Mother Emanuel member Marvin Stewart has tried to emulate the love he saw in his nine friends killed that night.",

As I sat in church today, and I keep hearing the word forgiveness, I said, \u2018am I in that space?\u2019 I would use the word acceptance as the space I\u2019m in,\u201d Stewart said after the service.",
      "One hymn was sung Tuesday. It was \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d \u2014 the spiritual that Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president, began singing at the memorial service for the nine victims, held just blocks from Gadsden's Wharf, where an estimated 40% of enslaved Africans first touched U.S. soil.",

      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is lifting a curfew in downtown Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Downtown Los Angeles businesses hoped customers would return quickly on Tuesday after Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew she had imposed last week to prevent vandalism and break-ins during nighttime protests against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The protests, which have been concentrated in a few blocks of downtown where federal and local government buildings are, were in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in the city and subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.",
      "The curfew set in place June 10 provided \u201csuccessful crime prevention and suppression efforts\" and protected stores, restaurants, businesses and residents, the Democratic mayor said. It covered a relatively tiny slice of the sprawling city.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the impact of days of protests could be seen in the boarded-up windows lining the streets of Little Tokyo, a historical Japanese American district right next to a federal detention building still heavily guarded by military troops.",
      "A steady stream of tourists stopped in the neighborhood to take photos of baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani wearing Dodgers blue in a massive mural on the side of a hotel.",
      "Don Tahara, the owner of Far Bar, said businesses in the area have been hit hard with vandalism and some break-ins.",
      "On June 8, thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to Trump\u2019s deployment of the Guard, blocking off a major freeway as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire.",
      "A day later, police officers used flash bangs and shot projectiles as they pushed protesters through Little Tokyo, where bystanders and restaurant workers rushed to get out of their way. Some protesters set off fireworks and threw water bottles at the officers, yelling, \u201cShame!\u201d",
      "But Tahara, a third-generation Japanese American immigrant, said he also understands why the protests were necessary, seeing similarities between the current administration's immigration raids and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.",
      "\u201cThe problems that Little Tokyo had 75 years ago was basically the federal government coming in and imprisoning all of them in concentration camps,\u201d Tahara said. \u201cThey were uprooted from their homes and businesses, their churches ... we're seeing a repeat of that.\u201d",
      "Since people assumed the curfew would still be in place Tuesday, Far Bar has still had many cancellations of reservations and events. They decided to open earlier for lunchtime in the past few days, but employees have lost hours from their paychecks. Combined with the lingering effects of the LA wildfires earlier this year, tariff-induced price increases and other increased costs, it has been a challenging climate for businesses to navigate, Tahara said.",
      "On Monday, Bass trimmed back curfew hours from beginning at 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. after a drop in arrests in the area. Bass faulted a relatively small group of \u201cbad actors who do not care about the immigrant community,\u201d a nod to thousands of protesters who exercised their rights peacefully. Trump directed federal immigration officials Sunday to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after a weekend of large protests all across the country against his administration.",
      "Cindy Reyes, head server at Rakkan Ramen, said they completely shut down the shop for Saturday's protests and closed early on Sunday. The curfew was especially difficult for their night-shift workers because the ramen joint is usually open until midnight.",
      "\u201cDinner shift makes the most money because we're the last restaurant standing so people come to us in the end,\u201d she said.",
      "The Historic Core of downtown LA, further away from where the protests have occurred and home to many nightclubs and bars, has also suffered from break-ins. Many closed down for the duration of the curfew because their core business happens in the evening.",
      "Rhythm Room owner Vincent Vong said he has lost tens of thousands of dollars from closing for a whole week, not just from the loss of business but also to keep paying his employees.",
      "\u201cI have to schedule people to come in because I need to get them paid somehow,\u201d he said.",
      "He wished there was more support from the city and deployment of law enforcement resources to protecting the \u201cmost vulnerable areas,\u201d pointing out that his street has often been the target of vandalism and theft during large demonstrations.",
      "Even as the curfew is lifted, Vong said it will be difficult to bring customers back to an area that still has boarded-up windows and feels \u201capocalyptic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to double down in showing that downtown LA is still a safe place to go,\u201d he said.",

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "A new execution date is being requested for Robert Roberson",
      "HOUSTON -- A new execution date has been requested for Robert Roberson, a Texas man who had been set last year to become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death for a murder conviction tied to a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Monday\u2019s request from the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office was the first time authorities had asked for a new execution date since Roberson received a stay in October. The execution's delay followed a flurry of last-ditch legal challenges on the night of his scheduled lethal injection that were prompted by an unprecedented maneuver from a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers who say he is innocent and was sent to death row based on flawed science.",
      "In its five-page motion, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state\u2019s top criminal court, has previously denied appeals in Roberson\u2019s case, \u201cthe criteria for setting an execution have been met.\u201d",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office requested a new execution date of Oct. 16.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "Court documents show the Anderson County District Attorney\u2019s Office, which had prosecuted Roberson, has agreed to let the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office take over the case.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of the 2002 killing of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. Prosecutors argued he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what\u2019s called shaken baby syndrome. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.",
      "Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson\u2019s attorneys, criticized the office of Attorney General Ken Paxton for asking for a new execution date when Roberson still has an appeal pending before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that his legal team says contains \u201cpowerful new evidence of his innocence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no justification for the Attorney General\u2019s relentless effort to kill an innocent human being \u2014 and no state law or moral law that authorizes seeking an execution date under these circumstances,\u201d Sween said in a statement.",
      "In its latest appeal filed in February, Roberson\u2019s legal team said new evidence, including statements from pathologists that state the girl\u2019s death was not a homicide and question the reliability of conclusions by the medical examiner on the cause of death, show \u201cno rational juror would find Roberson guilty of capital murder; and unreliable and outdated scientific and medical evidence was material to his conviction.\u201d",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have asked that a hearing be held over whether a new execution date should be set. It was not immediately known when a court hearing could be held as the case currently does not have a presiding judge as the previous judge recused herself from the case in November.",
      "Roberson had been in a holding cell in October, a few feet away from America\u2019s busiest death chamber in Huntsville, waiting to receive a lethal injection when he was granted an execution stay after a group of Texas lawmakers issued a subpoena for him to testify before a House committee several days after he was scheduled to die.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it could not be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",
      "Roberson never testified before the House committee as Paxton\u2019s office blocked efforts to have him speak to lawmakers.",

      "The xAI data center began operating gas turbines last year, emitting air pollution, without first applying for a permit under an exemption that allowed them to do so for 364 days. The permit application now being considered by the Shelby County Health Department calls for the use of 15 turbines, though the Southern Environmental Law Center says there are as many as 35 turbines located at the sprawling facility.",
      "Musk\u2019s xAI said the turbines will be equipped with technology to reduce emissions \u2014 and that it\u2019s already boosting the city\u2019s economy by investing billions of dollars in the supercomputer facility, paying millions in local taxes and creating hundreds of jobs. The company also is spending $35 million to build a power substation and $80 million to build a water recycling plant to the support Memphis, Light, Gas and Water, the local utility.",

      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to include certainly everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort,\" said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., on Monday. She added, \u201cThis is an unregulated area that will now be regulated.\u201d",
      "Known as the GENIUS Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.\u201d",
      "It's expected to pass Tuesday, since it only requires a simple majority vote \u2014 and it already cleared its biggest procedural hurdle last week in a 68-30 vote. But the bill has faced more resistance than initially expected.",
      "There is a provision in the bill that bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House.",
      "Trump hosted a private dinner last month at his golf club with top investors in a Trump-branded meme coin. His family holds a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that provides yet another avenue where investors are buying in and enriching the president\u2019s relatives. World Liberty has launched its own stablecoin, USD1.",
      "The administration is broadly supportive of crypto's growth and its integration into the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the legislation could help push the U.S. stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028.",
      "Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest crypto exchange and a major advocate for the bill \u2014 has met with Trump and praised his early moves on crypto. This past weekend, Coinbase was among the more prominent brands that sponsored a parade in Washington commemorating the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 an event that coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "But the crypto industry emphasizes that they view the legislative effort as bipartisan, pointing to champions on each side of the aisle.",
      "\u201cThe GENIUS Act will be the most significant digital assets legislation ever to pass the U.S. Senate,\u201d Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said ahead of a key vote last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the product of months of bipartisan work.\u201d",
      "The bill did hit one rough patch in early May, when a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously supported the bill reversed course and voted to block it from advancing. That prompted new negotiations involving Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, which ultimately produced the compromise version expected to win passage Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere were many, many changes that were made. And ultimately, it\u2019s a much better deal because we were all at the table,\u201d Alsobrooks said.",
      "Still, the bill leaves unresolved concerns over presidential conflicts of interest \u2014 an issue that remains a source of tension within the Democratic caucus.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been among the most outspoken as the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, warning that the bill creates a \u201csuper highway\u201d for Trump corruption. She has also warned that the bill would allow major technology companies, such as Amazon and Meta, to launch their own stablecoins.",
      "If the stablecoin legislation passes the Senate on Tuesday, it still faces several hurdles before reaching the president\u2019s desk. It must clear the narrowly held Republican majority in the House, where lawmakers may try to attach a broader market structure bill \u2014 sweeping legislation that could make passage through the Senate more difficult.",
      "Trump has said he wants stablecoin legislation on his desk before Congress breaks for its August recess, now just under 50 days away.",

      "Early Saturday morning, when a man dressed like a police officer knocked at the home of a Minnesota state legislator, marked the start of nearly 40 hours of violence and fear that swept through towns in an arc around Minneapolis",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Violence and fear swept through towns in an arc around Minneapolis for more than 40 hours over the weekend as a man seemingly intent on sowing political devastation killed one Minnesota state lawmaker and left another bleeding from nine bullet wounds.",
      "The attacks sparked the largest manhunt in Minnesota history, with heavily armed officers in full combat gear riding armored vehicles through suburban streets and country roads, ending in the arrest of Vance Boelter, a 57-year-old father of five and sometime Christian pastor known for his deeply conservative beliefs \u2014 but whose friends never saw him as an extremist.",
      "From a state that has long prided itself on political civility, the attacks rippled across the country as frightened political leaders worried that America\u2019s divides could cost them their lives.",
      "\u201cThis was a political assassination, which is not the word we use very often in the United States, let alone in Minnesota\u201d acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson told reporters Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a chilling attack on our democracy, on our way of life.\u201d",
      "The black SUV\u2019s emergency lights were flashing when it pulled up to the brick split-level home in the quiet, middle-class Minneapolis suburb. The maple tree in the front yard was lush with summer leaves.",
      "The man got out of the car wearing tactical clothing, body armor and what looked like a police badge. He was carrying a 9 mm Beretta pistol.",
      "He knocked loudly and repeatedly shouted, \u201cThis is the police, open the door.\u201d",
      "Later, even law enforcement officials said they would have believed he was a police officer.",
      "The couple who lived at the Champlin home, Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, opened the door to a flashlight shining in their faces.",
      "There had been a report of a shooting in the house, Boelter told them. But when he eventually lowered the flashlight, Yvette Hoffman could see he was wearing a realistic mask that covered his entire head. In the confrontation that followed, he shot both repeatedly. The next morning, nine bullet holes could be seen in their front door.",
      "Police responded within minutes, after a 911 call from the Hoffman\u2019s adult daughter, who also lives in the house.",
      "The legislator and his wife were rushed to a nearby hospital.",
      "A little more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, security camera footage showed Boelter, still in his mask and tactical clothing, holding a flashlight as he rang the doorbell at the home of someone who authorities have so far only identified as \u201cPublic Official 1.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the police. Open the door,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cWe have a warrant.\u201d",
      "Boelter was traveling with a list of about 70 names, including prominent state and federal lawmakers, community leaders and abortion-rights advocates, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation.",
      "The federal affidavit says the list was composed of \u201cmostly or all Democrats.\u201d",
      "No one was at the Maple Grove home. Boelter soon left.",
      "But he had plenty of other targets. Boelter had carefully planned his attacks in advance, making notes about targets' families and conducting surveillance on their homes, Thompson said.",
      "\u201cBoelter stalked his victims like prey,\u201d he said.",
      "Roughly 5 miles (8 kilometers) away, in another suburb just north of Minneapolis, Boelter drove to the home of Democratic state Sen. Ann Rest.",
      "By then, law enforcement was starting to worry about local legislators and New Hope police dispatched an officer to do a safety check at Rest\u2019s home.",
      "That officer found what she thought was a police vehicle already doing a check, parked down the street from the house. When the officer tried to speak to Boelter, he stared straight ahead and didn\u2019t respond.",
      "The officer then drove to Rest\u2019s home, and after seeing no trouble waited for backup and returned to where Boelter had been parked.",
      "But by then he was gone.",
      "An off-duty sergeant with the Brooklyn Park police was leaving the station when he heard about the shooting at Hoffman\u2019s house.",
      "\u201c\u2019Hey, drive by Melissa Hortman\u2019s house and just check on the house, would you?\u201d he told a pair of officers, the city\u2019s police chief, Mark Bruley, told reporters. Hortman, 55, the former house speaker, had long been one of the state's leading Democrats.",
      "Boelter, his phony police car parked out front with its lights flashing, was standing at the front door of the large brick home when the real Brooklyn Park officers arrived.",
      "\u201cMoments after their arrival on scene, Boelter fired several gunshots as he moved forward, entering the Hortmans\u2019 home,\u201d the federal affidavit states. Moments later, he fired a second set of shots.",
      "The officers moved to the house and found a gravely injured Mark Hortman in the doorway. Inside the house, they found Melissa Hortman. She had also been badly shot.",
      "Both soon died.",
      "Left behind, though, was Boelter\u2019s car, with the list of targets and at least five weapons. Nearby, police found the mask Boelter had worn along with the pistol he\u2019d carried.",
      "Law enforcement believed he was on foot.",
      "\u201cDad went to war last night,\u201d said a message Boelter sent on a family group text, which his wife eventually shared with authorities. Police had found her by tracking her cellphone. They found her in a car with her children, along with two handguns, about $10,000 in cash and passports, the affidavit said.",
      "Boelter had apparently urged her to leave.",
      "\u201cWords are not going to explain how sorry I am,\u201d he said in another message. \u201cthere\u2019s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don\u2019t want you guys around.\u201d",
      "He also reached out to two roommates with whom he sometimes stayed in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cMay be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\u201d Boelter wrote, according to Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.",
      "Friends said Boelter had been struggling financially in recent years. In 2023, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies from assisted-living facilities. That job ended about four months ago.",
      "Within hours of the Hortman shooting, hundreds of police officers, sheriff deputies and FBI agents were roaming the streets near the scene.",
      "Cellphones in the area pinged an alert, urging people near the Hortmans\u2019 neighborhood to take shelter. \u201cPolice are still looking for a suspect in multiple targeted shootings who is armed and dangerous,\" the alert said, giving a description of Boelter. \u201cDo not approach.\u201d",
      "A series of roadblocks was also set up, with law enforcement searching every vehicle as it left, fearing Boelter could try to escape by hiding in a car.",
      "Carrying two duffel bags, Boelter approached a man he didn\u2019t know at a Minneapolis bus stop roughly 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the Hortmans\u2019 home and asked to purchase his electric bike. After taking the bus together to the man\u2019s home, Boelter agreed to buy the bike and the man\u2019s Buick sedan. They then drove the Buick to a bank branch in nearby Robbinsdale, where Boelter, who can be seen in security footage wearing a cowboy hat, withdrew $2,200, emptying his bank account. He paid the man $900.",
      "Law enforcement received a report of someone riding an e-bike on a country road outside the small town of Green Isle, about an hour from downtown Minneapolis.",
      "The cyclist was not found, but Boelter\u2019s family lives not far away, in a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house they bought in 2023 for more than $500,000.",
      "The Buick was found, abandoned, near where the cyclist had been spotted.",
      "Worried about explosives, law enforcement initially used a robot to check the car. Inside, they found the cowboy hat that Boelter appeared to be wearing in the bank.",
      "There was also a handwritten letter addressed to the FBI in which Boelter said he was \u201cthe shooter at large in Minnesota involved in the 2 shootings.\u201d",
      "Law enforcement set up a large perimeter near Green Isle after a police officer thought he'd seen Boelter running into the woods. Twenty tactical teams were called in for an intensive search.",
      "For hours, heavily armed men, some with dogs, walked the roads and fields of rural Sibley County. A helicopter was called in to help.",
      "Boelter was spotted shortly before nightfall, and officers surrounded him.",
      "He soon surrendered, crawling to officers who handcuffed him and took him into custody.",
      "Boelter now faces a series of state charges, including murder and attempted murder. Federal prosecutors announced they had charged him with murder and stalking, which could result in a death sentence if he is convicted.",
      "At a federal court hearing Monday in St. Paul, Boelter said he could not afford an attorney. A federal defender was appointed to represent him. He was ordered held without bail ahead of a court appearance next week.",
      "Across the U.S., local and state politicians rushed to scrub home addresses from websites and began debating whether security should now be provided for politicians like state senators.",
      "U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar shared a text from Yvette Hoffman, whose recovery came quicker than her husband's.",
      "\u201cJohn is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\u201d Yvette Hoffman said Saturday in a text that Klobuchar posted on social media. \u201cHe took 9 bullet hits. I took 8 and we are both incredibly lucky to be alive. We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- On the 105th day of what was supposed to be a 60-day session, Florida lawmakers gave final approval to a leaner state budget totaling $115.1 billion, marking the end of a lawmaking season that was largely defined by inter-party clashes in the Republican-dominated capitol.",
      "The new budget lacks some of the top priorities of legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, coming in $500 million less than the governor's proposed budget, and $3.5 billion less than last year's adjusted total, a goal of conservative lawmakers focused on scaling back state spending amid concerns of a broader economic slowdown.",
      "The state's legislative leaders had debated for weeks over competing tax cut proposals, initially pushing for broad sales tax relief for everyday Floridians before settling on a package that mostly benefits businesses.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t view this on day 105 as a failure,\u201d Republican Senate President Ben Albritton said. \u201cWe dug in deep.\u201d",
      "The budget now goes to the governor, who has the power to veto individual line items and is known for slashing into lawmakers\u2019 spending plans.",
      "Here's a look at Florida's budget by the numbers.",
      "While political and tropical storms loom on the horizon, Florida's legislative leaders have largely downplayed concerns about how President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive and unpredictable economic policies could impact the state's budget, even as he pledges to phase out the federal agency that responds to hurricanes and other disasters that batter the state.",
      "But lawmakers have taken steps to shore up reserves, as forecasters warn of a busier than usual hurricane season and as economists fret over Trump's trade wars and a sweeping proposal to cut federal taxes and spending.",
      "Lawmakers crafted a compromise budget and tax cut package, which would save taxpayers and reduce state revenues by an estimated $1.3 billion a year, according to legislative staff. They've also taken steps to set aside an additional $750 million a year into a reserve fund for emergencies, pending voter approval.",
      "Republican House Speaker Daniel Perez said building up the reserves is about \"being prepared for the unexpected.\"",
      "\u201cNone of us know what the future holds,\u201d Perez said.",
      "The legislature advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that would set aside $750 million a year \u2014 or an amount equal to up to 25% of the state\u2019s general revenue, whichever is less \u2014 into a reserve fund that lawmakers could only use for emergencies. The measure has to be approved by 60% of Florida voters to be implemented.",
      "The last time state officials tapped into the budget stabilization fund was in 2008, as the Great Recession blasted through Florida's tourism and development-heavy economy. Boosting the reserves is a prudent move, said Republican House Budget Committee Chair Lawrence McClure, and another way to cut state spending.",
      "\u201cWe are doing this so that are we are truly prepared for a break the glass situation,\u201d McClure said.",
      "Democrats have called the reserve fund a \u201clock box\u201d and said lawmakers should keep the funds on hand to support needy Floridians, at a time when many residents are priced out of their homes and schools and prisons are struggling to keep staff on the job.",
      "The Florida House had initially called for cutting the state's overall sales tax from 6% to 5.25%. A competing offer in the state Senate called for a tax break on clothing purchases under $75. Instead, the largest tax break lawmakers approved was for companies, by eliminating the state's business rent tax. They also approved tax cuts for a slate of special interests including casinos, airlines and NASCAR.",
      "Florida residents will get sales tax relief on hurricane supplies, sunscreen and bug spray, and a tax exemption on clothes and school supplies each August.",
      "State lawmakers are setting aside $4 billion for scholarships for private and religious education, two years after the Legislature expanded the state's voucher program to make all K-12 students eligible, regardless of family income. Since then, the state's indirect spending on private school tuition and homeschooling costs has risen dramatically, which critics warn is burning through the state's budget.",
      "Part of state lawmakers' push to cut back on what they see as government bloat is eliminating 2,238 vacant positions across state agencies from the department of health to the department of children and families. Many of the positions being cut have been vacant for three months.",
      "While the number of state jobs shrinks, state workers will receive an across-the-board 2% raise, while state law enforcement officers and firefighters will get a 10% total raise, and a 15% raise if they've been on the job for at least five years.",
      "The Legislature is also setting aside $3 million in grants for local jails that have contracted with the federal government to support immigration enforcement efforts. Florida has rushed to help the Trump administration carry out its mass deportation agenda and now leads the country in the number of local and state agencies signing on with the federal government to deputize their officers to carry out immigration enforcement.",

      "R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after prison staff gave him \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him\" and was later forcibly removed from a hospital against medical advice, his lawyer alleged in a statement to CBS News and a federal court filing.",
      "The disgraced singer's lawyer, Beau Brindley, is requesting that a judge move him to home detention from the North Carolina prison where he is serving his sentences.",
      "\"Mr. Kelly's life is in danger and the threat comes from Bureau of Prisons officers whose duty is to protect him,\" Brindley wrote in a court motion filed Monday.",
      "He alleges the federal Bureau of Prisons is \"seeking to kill\" Kelly \"to cover up crimes committed in the investigation of his case.\"",
      "When asked for a comment Tuesday about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told CBS News, \"For privacy, safety and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including medical and health-related issues.\" The bureau also said it does not comment on pending litigation or legal proceedings.",
      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News show Kelly's legal team discuss the emergency release request with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien in back-and-forth filings this week. \"Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will,\" Julien said in a response filed Monday. \"Undeterred, Kelly now asks this Court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy.\"",
      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",
      "Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in 2021 and of child pornography in Chicago a year later. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case and 20 years in prison in the Chicago case, which he is serving mostly simultaneously.",

      "A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the \"Friends\" star's overdose death will plead guilty, according to an agreement filed in court Monday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",

His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

      "In the new biography \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\" (Simon & Schuster), Todd S. Purdum explores the impact on American culture by the Cuban-born entertainer who (as husband and business partner of Lucille Ball) changed the rules of TV.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Purdum on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 15!",
      "\"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\"",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",

    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday counted a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "The first 20 cases did not result in hospitalizations, Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday. Those cases were in children 8 years old or younger.",
      "Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday after she spoke to CBS News.",
      "The first 20 cases also did not include people who received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis, Anton said. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized.",
      "\"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine have also been in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Colorado says many of its vaccinated cases have been in residents who were exposed during travel to other parts of the world facing large outbreaks like Canada and Europe.",
      "The state previously said it had linked multiple cases to an infectious traveler who exposed others at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight.",
      "The CDC has also issued new guidance for summer camps to prepare for the threat of measles spread this year, including urging camp operators to check for documentation of immunity among staff and children.",

Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",

Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019.

In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",

      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",

      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",

      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",

      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area, before a partnership with the hospital ended in 2021.",
      "Ross\u00a0is listed as cosigning an open letter during the COVID-19 pandemic that criticized a study that concluded ivermectin was ineffective for treating the disease. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has ignored a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",

      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "Brad Weston, CEO of At Home said in a statement that the company is \"operating against the backdrop of an increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving trade environment as we navigate the impact of tariffs.\" He added that the steps they are taking \"will improve our ability to compete in the marketplace in the face of continued volatility and increase the resilience of our business for the long term.\"",

      "At Home's court filings reveal fissures in the company's finances. At Home shuttered six stores in the last year, according to the company's Chapter 11 filing. And some macroeconomic factors like inflation and tariffs have placed \"significant pressure\" on its revenue, the company said.",

      "The voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings are taking place at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the company said in its\u00a0statement.

Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",

      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",
      "Even though job growth is slowing, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains\u00a0exceeding economists' expectations\u00a0last month.",
      "\"The current data do not support that theory that prices are rising or that the labor market is weakening quickly,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Friday cleared way for Nippon Steel purchase of U.S. Steel, including unusual control for the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0executive order\u00a0on Friday clearing the way for Japan-based Nippon Steel to potentially buy U.S. Steel comes with an unusual corporate twist called a \"golden share.\"",
      "As part of the agreement, Mr. Trump will gain power to approve a number of major corporate decisions for the company, signaling that the president could potentially block the company from relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, or transferring or relocating jobs outside the U.S.",
      "The details of the golden share were disclosed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday in a social media post, where he described the agreement as including \"powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel.\"",
      "What is a golden share?",
      "A \"golden share\" refers to special rights held by a government over a corporate entity. They are typically granted in relation to newly privatized businesses over which the government wants to maintain some control,\u00a0according to legal research company Westlaw.",
      "Golden shares have been employed in countries ranging from the U.K. to China, although they are rare in the U.S. In the former case, the U.K. government held a golden share in the British Airports Authority, although it was ruled illegal by a court in 2003. In the latter, the Communist Party had taken a percentage ownership in private companies as well as control over government board seats and voting power, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported in 2023.",
      "While presidents can indirectly influence corporate decisions through agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers for antitrust concerns, it's unusual for a commander-in-chief to exercise the level of control outlined by Lutnick regarding U.S. Steel. According to his post, U.S. Steel \u2014 which would keep its name and headquarters after the merger \u2014 also wouldn't be allowed to change its name from U.S. Steel without President Trump's approval.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent three directors and can veto the other two choices, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"The Art of the Deal,\" Lutnick wrote of the agreement, referencing Mr. Trump's best-selling book about his business skills and negotiating techniques.",
      "Terms remain unclear",
      "Lutnick described the golden share in the U.S. Steel deal as \"perpetual.\" The Commerce Department didn't return a request for clarification on if the golden share would transfer to subsequent presidents after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The full terms also remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel nor the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Friday, the two companies\u00a0announced in a joint statement\u00a0that they had agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement. They added the terms mandate $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "The U.S. Steelworkers union told CBS MoneyWatch that it can't comment on the golden shares without seeing more information about the agreement. But it pointed to a June 15 statement that expressed the union's disappointment with the president's decision to move forward with the merger.",
      "\"Details matter: Neither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\" the union letter said. \"And, while there is a claimed 'golden share,' what can we expect from Nippon's leadership in Japan which continues to build up overcapacity in steel globally and has been charged again with dumping by the Department of Commerce just weeks ago?\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM. It uses the Android operating system.",
      "It's unclear what company will manufacture the devices, with the Trump Mobile website noting that its products and services \"are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\" The website adds that the T1 Phone LLC is using the \"Trump\" name as part of a limited license agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/louvre-paris-closed-reopening-unclear/",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

      "Some details about the Nippon-U.S. Steel partnership are not clear. Mr. Trump said earlier this week\u00a0that the government's golden share would give the United States \"51% ownership\" and \"total control\" over U.S. Steel, but Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia quoted an unnamed Nippon executive who said the company needs \"management freedom\" over the combined company.",
      "Mr. Trump announced he would allow a \"partnership\" between Nippon and U.S. Steel last month.",
      "The deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel has faced tumult and uncertainty since a nearly $15 billion merger was first proposed in late 2023. Former President Joe Biden rejected the deal on national security grounds in the waning weeks of his time in office, but Mr. Trump ordered a new review of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities rather than fully acquiring the company.",
      "U.S. Steel has said the Nippon deal will allow for new investments in the company's aging facilities, including its Mon Valley Works in the Pittsburgh area. If the deal isn't approved, U.S. Steel has warned it may need to move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh and focus on cheaper ways of making steel than Mon Valley's blast furnaces, putting scores of jobs into jeopardy.",
      "But the United Steelworkers union is staunchly opposed to the deal, calling Nippon's promises to invest in steel mills \"public relations\" and accusing the company of job-costing unfair trade practices.",
      "Rival steelmaker Cleveland Cliffs \u2014 whose offer to buy U.S. Steel was rejected \u2014 has also blasted the deal, accusing Nippon of dumping cheap steel in American markets and saying U.S. Steel \"rejected an all-American solution and insisted on pursuing a doomed-to-fail cash out sale.\" In a lawsuit against the government in the waning days of the Biden administration, Nippon and U.S. Steel accused Cleveland Cliffs and the steel union of undermining their planned merger.",

      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said that a rare earth minerals shortage is hurting production and caused the automaker to temporarily shut down one of its plants last month, according to an interview with Bloomberg TV.",
      "Rare earth minerals, which are a set of 17 metallic elements, are integral to automobile production, and enable features like windshield wipers, seat belts and speakers to function. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",
      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",
      "\"The centrality of rare earth export restrictions to the trade deal underscores the criticality of minerals to the U.S. economy as well as the severity of the chokehold Beijing holds on global supply chains,\" policy experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a research note.",

      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "summary": "An Air India crash Thursday involved a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which the aircraft manufacturer first delivered 14 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",
      "Shares of Boeing fell $10.32, or 4.8%, to $203.59 in early trading.",
      "First crash of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner",
      "The Air India incident represents the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, although the aircraft has been involved in previous investigations.",
      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",
      "\"The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. We regret to inform that, of the 242 aboard, there are 241 confirmed fatalities. The sole survivor is being treated in a hospital,\" the airline\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement Thursday on social media.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",
      "A hull loss can indicate an airplane is completely destroyed or damaged and not repaired, the report said. It can also indicate an airplane is missing and the wreckage hasn't been found.",

    "story": [
      "Americans often voice frustration\u00a0over the ubiquity of tipping these days, but that hasn't stopped them from giving generously to reward good service.",
      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most.",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, LendingTree found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more. LendingTree also looked at which Americans around the country drop the biggest tips.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",
      "After New Hampshire, residents of Washington, D.C., are the nation's biggest tippers. People in the U.S. capital on average tip 12.65% when eating out.",
      "LendingTree's data indicates that the highest tippers tend to be located on the East Coast, while the lowest are concentrated in the South and western states. See the full rankings below.",

D.C. residents spent an average of $10,291 on dining out in 2023, about $3,500 more than residents in Nevada, the runner up. Illinois, on the other hand, saw the biggest increase in money spent on eating out, with dining expenditures climbing 13.5% from 2000 to 2023.",

      "With the federal minimum wage for tipped workers set at $2.13 an hour, many workers in service jobs such as waiters, hairdressers and bartenders lean heavily on tips to subsidize their income. Even with tips, they still may not reach the standard minimum wage of $7.25, in which case employers are required to step in and make up the difference, accoriding to the Fair Labor Standards Act.",
      "Tipping in the service industry has recently come into focus with the \"No Tax on Tips\" \u2014 a provision baked into the GOP spending bill that would remove federal taxes from tips for workers who earn less than $160,000.",
      "If passed, \"No Tax on Tips\" could offer relief to the 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

It comes amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown in the region, which has sparked a series of at times contentious protests in downtown L.A. over the past few weeks.",
      "U.S. Northern Command said in a statement that the troops were being activated under the Title 10 law, which President Trump previously invoked when he first announced on June 7 that he was deploying National Guard troops to L.A. in response to the demonstrations.",
      "The soldiers will \"support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area,\" USNORTHCOM said in a statement.",

      "\"You don't have the authority to arrest U.S. citizens asking for a judicial warrant,\" he could be heard saying during his arrest.",
      "\"Our heroic ICE law enforcement officers face a 413% increase in assaults against them -- it is wrong that politicians seeking higher office undermine law enforcement safety to get a viral moment. No one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.",

I'm grateful to hear that the charges are not being brought. But if they are, I've got a lawyer. I don't have to worry about my due process rights. At that elevator, I was separated from someone named Edgardo, who I had just met a couple of minutes earlier. Edgardo is in ICE detention, and he's not going to sleep in his bed tonight. So far as I know, he has no lawyer. He has been stripped of his due process rights by a government and a judge that owe him a credible fear hearing before they deport him, and yet have decided instead to strip folks like Edgardo. So I will be fine, but Edgardo is not going to be fine, and the rule of law is not fine, and our constitutional democracy is not fine.\"",
      "Lander said he's accompanied four families out of prior hearings \"all of whom were afraid they were going to be detained by ICE agents.\"",

As I stood in the hallway upstairs on the ninth floor waiting to know the whereabouts of my friend, almost everyone I spoke to who worked there in security and otherwise, they came from other countries. They're immigrants, themselves. Don't forget that.\"",
      "\"Today should not be about Brad Lander. It's about making sure all New Yorkers -- regardless of their documentation status -- feel safe enough to use public resources, like dialing 911, sending their kids to school, going to the hospital, or attending court appearances, and do not instead hide in the shadows,\" a spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.",
      "\"ICE arresting Brad Lander for asking questions is a stunning abuse of power and a threat to our democracy. Arresting a public official, the duly-elected comptroller of the City of New York, for asking questions is dangerous intimidation and shows a wanton disregard for the will of the people of New York. It sends an unmistakably authoritarian message -- that ICE doesn't care about the rule of law and that anyone exercising their right to challenge ICE and speak up for immigrants will be punished,\" ACLU of New York Executive Director Donna Lieberman said. \"All elected officials and candidates for office should condemn this arrest in the strongest terms and stand up for New Yorkers.\"",

I haven't practiced law in a while, but I sure know that what I saw today was not the rule of law. That was not due process, and the way people are being treated is absolutely unacceptable in this city and this country.\"",
      "She told reporters Lander and other advocates had repeatedly asked to see the judicial warrant and grounds for deportation and they were linking arms with the person in question.",
      "\"We're surrounding the individual, locking arms. We asked -- I was part of the group -- and we asked numerous times for the warrant, for their names, for their badge numbers. It was unclear what agency they were from, they're in full uniform, in many cases, with a mask pulled up over the bridge of their nose,\" said Barnette. \"So Brad, I assume, was saying, 'I am an American citizen, I am asking you for the judicial warrant, you do not have grounds to arrest me.'\"",
      "Barnette told CBS News New York Lander was arrested as he was walking with linked arms with the individual who had been the subject of the immigration court hearing.",
      "Lander has been going to immigration court on separate occasions for several weeks after a number of undocumented immigrants, including a Bronx high school student named Dylan, have been arrested by masked ICE agents after they show up to routine hearings.",
      "Barnette called that \"shocking and unacceptable.\"",
      "Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined the news conference and said, \"Thank you to Brad Lander.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, all the power we have is to be present and to witness what is happening. And everyone of any moral character, any moral consciousness will be thanking Brad Lander for being that witness and using what he could where he was with what he had to try to help someone,\" Williams said. \"What is happening in this country, what is happening in that building is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Lander's rabbi was also at the courthouse as an observer and spoke during the news conference.",
      "\"I share the public advocate's view that I have never been as proud of him as I am today, and I've known him in many situations,\" said Rabbi Ellen Lippmann. \"I have never been as ashamed to be an American or a New Yorker as I feel today, except for the uprising from all the incredible New Yorkers who represent the good and the true and the right in this city.\"",
      "What advocates allege is happening in immigration court",
      "Barnette described seeing multiple cases where the person is told that their case is dismissed and they have 30 days to appeal, but said they were then met by agents waiting for them in the hallway.",
      "\"What I saw happen, repeatedly, there and what I understand from other stories has continued to happen is that these folks have pending asylum cases, they are told, 'Your case is dismissed.' That sounds like good news. It is not good news. What that means is that you are subject to immediate removal when you leave the courtroom,\" she explained. \"And the ICE agents are lining the hallway, and that is not explained to people.\"",
      "\"They are kidnapping our neighbors off of the street. They are bamboozling them, they are tricking them to tell them to come here and something good will happen. And when they hear the court news, they believe something good has happened. And then they're faced with people in fatigues, with masks on their faces, and they're taken, having not understood even what just happened legally and what their recourse is,\" added Williams. \"That is something that we all have to stand up against.\"",

      "Analysts will be looking for clues in both states about voter sentiment with President Trump back in the Oval Office and Republicans controlling power in Washington.",
      "National Democrats' hold on Virginia has slipped in recent years, moving it close to swing-state status nationally. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin beat former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021. And although Democrats narrowly gained back complete control of the legislature in a 2023 election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won Virginia last year by less than six points, compared to former President Joe Biden's 10-point lead in 2020.",
      "Still, Democrats have history on their side: The party of the sitting president typically suffers defeat in Virginia's statewide races. And considering Mr. Trump has never won the state, Democrats are probably better positioned to make gains once their ticket solidifies.",
      "The six Democrats vying to be Virginia's next lieutenant governor aren't all that different on the issues: They support rights to abortion, a living wage, affordable housing and accessible health care. They also share similar criticisms of the president.",

      "Lateef, an eye surgeon, has honed in on education and health care. Salgado has stressed the importance of strengthening democracy, and Bastani has emphasized labor rights.",
      "Only one Republican candidate in each statewide contest is advancing to the ballot.",

Applicants can also still select \"X\" on a passport application form. Kobick's ruling expanded an earlier decision in April that only applied to six of the original plaintiffs.",
      "The executive order, issued by President Trump on Inauguration Day, directed the State Department to no longer issue U.S. passports with anything other than a male or female designation. It reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for Americans to self-select their gender on their passport application, and included an \"X\" for those who do not identify as either male or female.",

      "In April, Kobick ruled that the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the new passport policy \"related to an important governmental interest\" and found that the policy discriminated against transgender Americans.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group\u2014transgender Americans\u2014who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her April decision. The judge reaffirmed Tuesday that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case.",
      "\"This decision acknowledges the immediate and profound negative impact that the Trump administration's passport policy has on the ability of people across the country to travel for work, school, and family,\" said Jessie Rossman, legal director at the ACLU of Massachusetts. \"The Trump administration's passport policy attacks the foundations of the right to privacy and the freedom for all people to live their lives safely and with dignity.

      "Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot inside their Brooklyn Park home overnight Saturday. About 90 minutes before that, police say Boelter shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin.

      "A spokesperson for Walz's office gave this statement to WCCO on Tuesday:",
      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",

      "\"They're not vetted or reviewed personally by the governor. In many cases, this is done as it should be, by subordinates, you know, who then bring to the governor the recommendations,\" Schultz said. \"And this is no different than what we would find in business and industry, where we don't expect the president of most companies to be involved in the hiring for every position.\"",
      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",

      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection.

      "Lee posted on X after the shootings: \"This is what happens When Marxists don't get their way.\" The post was deleted by Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Smith said she decided to confront Lee about the post because of the pain it caused her \"and the other people in my state and I think around the country, who think that this was a brutal attack.\"",

      "The Minnesota Democrat's deputy chief of staff Ed Shelleby also sent an email to one of Lee's top staffers, saying he \"exploited the murder of a lifetime public servant and her husband to post some sick burns about Democrats ... Have you absolutely no conscience?\"",
      "\"It is important for your office to know much additional pain you've caused on an unspeakably horrific weekend,\" said the email, which CBS News obtained. \"Why would you use the awesome power of a United States Senator office to compound on people's grief?\"",
      "Smith, asked whether she had considered elevating the incident to leadership, said she hadn't thought about it, adding that \"I hope that my talking with him will cause him to think more about the hateful things that he has been putting out on his personal X account that really should have no place in our public discourse.\"",
      "On \"The Takeout\" with Major Garrett Tuesday, Smith said Lee has not apologized.",
      "\"And what about apologizing to John Hoffman and his wife? Yvette? What about apologizing to Melissa and Mark's children who are in their twenties and have just lost both of their parents? And he used the person who murdered their parents as a way to, you know, accomplish some, you know, something on social media that was just only to benefit him,\" she told Garrett. \"It's shameful.\"",
      "Smith also criticized President Trump for \"pardoning people who attacked our \u2014 the base of our government operations and people who committed assault against police officers.\"",
      "\"The dynamic of what this really means in our country today just seems very, very challenging,\" she told Garrett. \"I think we're at a tipping point. We can either take a step back and try to figure out how to reclaim the civic ground, or we are gonna inevitably continue down this path of more violence and more chaos. And we cannot let that be the path that we choose.\"",

      "\"What the senior senator from Utah posted after the shooting was reckless and beneath the dignity of his office,\" Schumer said, urging Lee to take down his posts.",
      "Lee did not respond to questions from reporters about his conversation with Smith at the Capitol on Monday. Smith, asked about Lee's reaction, said, \"Honestly, he seemed a little surprised to be confronted.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last week in San Diego.",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Sayed Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego after he attended a mandatory immigration hearing on Wednesday, June 11.",
      "\"For more than three years I worked for the U.S. military back in my home country,\" Naser said in the video as the masked officers took him into custody. \"I came here to make a better life. I didn't know this was going to happen like this for me.\"",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "The Department for Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to, and DHS did not respond to our request for more information.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-vote-genius-act-crypto-stablecoin-bill/",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:03:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The two companies have argued that President Trump does not have the authority to impose tariffs under a federal emergency powers law.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to swiftly take up their challenge to President Trump's sweeping tariffs, arguing that the \"massive impact\" on businesses and consumers warrants its immediate intervention.",
      "The companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, urged the justices to decide whether a federal emergency powers law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, gives the president the power to impose tariffs. They are asking the Supreme Court to take up their court fight before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit weighs in and expedite consideration of that request.",
      "The companies have suggested that if the court does decide to take up their case, it should hear arguments on Mr. Trump's authority to impose the levies during either a special September sitting or in October, when the justices will convene for their next term.",
      "\"In light of the tariffs' massive impact on virtually every business and consumer across the nation, and the unremitting whiplash caused by the unfettered tariffing power the president claims, challenges to the IEEPA tariffs cannot await the normal appellate process (even on an expedited timeline),\" lawyers for Learning Resources and hand2mind wrote in a filing.",
      "Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, said the cost of the tariffs is \"unbearable.\"",
      "\"It's a tax increase, so there's are very substantial separation of powers issues here that need to be addressed,\" he told CBS News. \"The executive branch does not have the power to tax us but they have.\"",
      "Woldenberg said the tariffs are an \"urgent matter\" that the Supreme Court needs to address.",
      "The companies' lawsuit is separate from another challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs that was filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade. In that case, brought by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states, the trade court permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as his duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review that decision. The Federal Circuit allowed Trump's tariffs to go back into effect while it considers the appeal and scheduled arguments for July 31.",
      "The dispute now before the Supreme Court was brought in federal court in Washington, D.C. The companies argued that neither the Constitution nor IEEPA grants the president the authority to levy tariffs at all. The case specifically involves his 10% baseline tariff on most countries, as well as a 20% tariff on China that Mr. Trump said is in response to the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled in favor of the firms last month, finding that the emergency powers law \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. His decision, though, was more narrow, as it barred the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "In their filing with the Supreme Court, the companies reiterated that IEEPA does not give the president unilateral power to set the sweeping tariffs. They said that the two courts that have ruled on the matter \u2014 the district court in Washington and the trade court \u2014 both declared Mr. Trump's levies unlawful on two different grounds.",
      "But they noted that those injunctions have not been paused pending the appeals.",
      "\"Even as these punishing tariffs cause American businesses and consumers to bleed billions of dollars each month, there will be no relief any time soon,\" lawyers for the firms said.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are a centerpiece of his economic agenda, and he has argued that they are critical to bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The president has also used the tariffs, and the threat of higher rates, as leverage to force trading partners into negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" But soon after, the president halted the reciprocal duties on 57 countries amid rattled financial markets and concerns of an economic downturn.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:57:33 -0400",
    "summary": "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on whether President Trump must return control of California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in San Francisco weighed Tuesday whether President Trump can continue with his deployment of California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations and appeared skeptical of the state's arguments against the president's mobilization of more than 4,000 troops.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on a Justice Department request for it to halt a district judge's order that required Mr. Trump to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom while the court fight moves forward. Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles.",
      "Brett Shumate, an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department, said Mr. Trump's decision to call National Guard troops into federal service under a law known as Title 10 is unreviewable by courts, regardless of the facts of the case. If the panel were to side with California, he warned, \"it puts Article III judges on a collision course with the commander-in-chief.\"",
      "Shumate said that California's interpretation of the law is \"dangerous\" and would allow Newsom to issue a \"pocket veto\" of any future orders from Mr. Trump. He said it's \"essential\" that the district court's injunction be lifted and said leaving it intact would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "Shumate said that if the 9th Circuit declines to halt the district judge's order, it should allow the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "But Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for California, said Mr. Trump's order calling the National Guard into federal service sweeps too broadly. He told the court that the president failed to consider any \"modest measures\" to quell protests in Los Angeles before taking the \"grave and extraordinary step\" of calling forth the National Guard.",
      "Harbourt told the judges that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he unilaterally decided to deploy the California National Guard to Los Angeles and warned that the continued presence of troops in city streets would escalate tensions and the risk of violence.",
      "The three judges considering the Trump administration's request for a stay during the appeal are Judges Mark Bennett, Eric Miller and Jennifer Sung. Mr. Trump appointed Bennett and Miller during his first term, and former President Joe Biden tapped Sung for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Early on, Bennett appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's position that courts cannot review the president's decision to federalize the National Guard and should not second-guess his military judgments. But as the arguments continued, all three judges pressed Harbourt on his position.",
      "Bennett asked where in the law there is a requirement for the president to have considered alternative measures before exercising control of the National Guard. He also probed Harbourt on his claim that Title 10 required Mr. Trump to consult with Newsom before calling the California troops into federal service.",
      "Miller cited a state law that he said effectively makes the adjutant general of the California National Guard a \"substitute\" for the governor. Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of Guard troops, and he then issued memoranda to the adjutant general to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "The case landed before the 9th Circuit after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled last week that Mr. Trump's actions in deploying the National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles were illegal and blocked the administration from deploying the troops in the city.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed that decision, and the 9th Circuit panel issued a temporary administrative stay while it took more time to consider the issue.",
      "The legal battle involves whether the president exceeded his authority when he invoked Title 10 to call forth the California National Guard in response to protests in California's largest city. Demonstrations broke out earlier this month after immigration agents conducted raids across Los Angeles as part of the administration's efforts to crack down on immigration and execute mass deportations.",
      "Title 10 lays out three circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service: when the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; when there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the U.S.; or when the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws. It then says that orders \"shall be issued through\" the governor.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his June 7 memorandum ordering the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members that the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion,\" which allowed him to federalize the National Guard and bypass Newsom. An additional 2,000 troops were brought under federal command. Roughly 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have also been mobilized to the area to protect federal property and immigration agents during arrests.",
      "In his decision, Breyer rejected the president's claim that the demonstrations are a \"rebellion,\" writing that he is \"troubled by the implication inherent in defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.\"",
      "The protests, the judge said, \"fall far short\" of rebellion, and the administration failed to identify a \"violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole.\" The judge's order did not address the president's mobilization of the Marines to Los Angeles.",
      "In filings with the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration argued that courts do not have a role in reviewing the president's decision to deploy the troops. Even if courts could review his decision to call the National Guard into federal service, the Justice Department said the president had ample reason to determine that the protests in Los Angeles rose to the level of a \"danger\" of rebellion, one of the conditions laid out in Title 10.",
      "\"The district court's order improperly impinges on the commander in chief's supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the Held, and puts federal officers (and others) in harm's way,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "Newsom and California officials told the 9th Circuit in filings that Breyer's order should be left undisturbed, as it restored the status quo in place before Mr. Trump's June 7 memorandum.",
      "\"Considered individually, defendants' legal arguments are meritless. Considered in the aggregate, they are terrifying,\" California lawyers wrote. They said that the administration's interpretation of Title 10 \"would empower the president to commandeer a state's National Guard based merely on evidence that some civilians opposed his authority, disobeyed his commands, or presented operational difficulties for civil law enforcement officials \u2014 and without any input from (or even notice to) the governor. \"",
      "They said that \"unchecked power\" could be used in any context, \"not just where civilians are protesting immigration enforcement, but also where they are protesting other policies of a federal administration, or protesting in advance of a hotly contested federal election.\"",
      "\"Collectively, defendants' arguments would sideline the judiciary, ignore Congress's limitations, and trample over the states' sovereign interest in their own militias,\" California's attorneys argued.",
      "Among the issues before the 9th Circuit panel is whether the Trump administration properly notified Newsom of its order calling the National Guard into federal service. The Justice Department argued in lower court proceedings that it did because two memos calling up the National Guard went through California's adjutant general, who runs the California National Guard, and not Newsom's office, as California has argued is necessary.",
      "That argument, Breyer wrote, \"strains credibility\" because Congress mandates that the National Guard requires the notice to be \"issued through the governors.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are looking to limit President Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution.",
      "\"This is not our war,\" Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said in a post on X Tuesday announcing that he had introduced a measure under the 1973 War Powers Resolution to block U.S. strikes. \"Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution.\"",
      "The Constitution grants Congress the sole power to declare war, and the extent of the president's authority to wade into conflict abroad without the approval of the legislative branch has been challenged in recent years. In 2020, Mr. Trump faced criticism for his decision to strike Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani without notifying congressional leaders.",
      "Massie's resolution aims to force the president to seek congressional approval before entering a war with Iran and would terminate the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran without Congress' expressed approval. It's cosponsored by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who urged \"every member to go on record\" in a post on X on Monday.",
      "\"Are you with the neocons who led us into Iraq or do you stand with the American people?\" Khanna said.",
      "The privileged resolution would force a vote on the matter within a number of days. The House is currently on recess, but leaders will be forced to engage with the push upon their return. The vote would put Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, in a difficult position, given his strong support of Israel and the president.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, is leading an effort in the Senate and introduced a similar resolution on Monday that forces a vote on requiring Mr. Trump to get congressional approval or a formal declaration of war to attack Iran, unless the U.S. is defending itself against an imminent attack.",
      "\"This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation's men and women in uniform into harm's way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress,\" Kaine said in a statement.",
      "Kaine said Tuesday he didn't have any cosponsors to announce yet, but \"I definitely have interest.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he isn't backing Kaine's resolution, telling reporters that \"there's very little danger\" of Mr. Trump leading the U.S. into war. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, urged Mr. Trump to \"go all in\" if diplomacy fails.",
      "\"If that means providing bombs, provide bombs,\" Graham said Sunday in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel.\"",
      "Mr. Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit on Monday, citing the Israel-Iran conflict. After returning to Washington, the president wrote that \"we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran\" and warned \"we know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding.\"",
      "\"He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\" the president said.",
      "At least one Democrat said he plans to vote against Kaine's resolution. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who supports preemptive strikes against Iran, said he doesn't want to take any action that would curtail Mr. Trump's ability to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said his position is \"no president can bomb another country without the permission of Congress.\"",
      "\"It's always been my belief that you don't go to war without the approval of Congress and bombing other countries is obviously war. If you want to do that, you need to come to Congress and ask for permission,\" Paul told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, is pushing another measure to prohibit the use of federal funds or any use of military force against Iran without consent from Congress, except in the case of self-defense. It had a handful of cosponsors on Monday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday that Mr. Trump is acting within his authorities for the moment and that considering war powers resolutions is \"getting the cart ahead of the horse.\"",
      "\"If this thing were to extend for some period of time, there could be a more fulsome discussion about what the role of Congress should be and whether or not we need to take action,\" Thune said.",

      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",
      "The president said it was possible he could send special envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, or both, to meet with Iranian negotiators, but \"it depends what happens when I get back\" to Washington.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",
      "Asked if it would take U.S. involvement to destroy Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Trump said he hoped it would be \"wiped out long before that.\"",
      "Vance says Trump has \"shown remarkable restraint\" but \"may decide he needs to take further action\"",
      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",
      "On Monday, an Iranian missile slammed into an apartment building in the central Israel city of Peta Tikva, killing four people.",
      "Israeli American Lihi Griner was there, with her husband and three children, hiding in their safe room.",
      "\"It was the biggest boom ever,\" she told CBS News. \"Even our safe room was shaking.\"",
      "When the family emerged, they found shattered glass strewn across their apartment.",
      "Given Mr. Trump's warnings and Netanyahu's stated determination to remove what he considers the multi-faceted threat posed by the Iranian regime, CBS News asked Griner if she was prepared for the war with Iran to get worse before it gets better.",
      "\"I'm not prepared,\" she said. \"I'm just gonna go and run in my little, you know, bomb shelter. I'm not prepared for everything. I wasn't prepared for this.\"",

      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous\u00a0Purdue bankruptcy settlement\u00a0was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Sunday night directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after large protests erupted in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas against the Trump administration's immigration policies.",
      "In a Truth Social post, the president called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \"to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He added that to reach the goal officials \"must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"",
      "\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of the president's immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's\u00a0crackdown\u00a0on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News. The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the\u00a0agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he heard from hotel, agriculture and leisure industries that his \"very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them\" and promised that changes would be made.",
      "Opponents of the president's immigration policies took to the streets as part of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations Saturday that came as Mr. Trump held a massive parade in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The parade featured tanks, flyovers and fireworks.",
      "Mr. Trump made the call for stepped up enforcement in Democratic-controlled cities on social media as he was making his way to the Group of Seven economic summit in Alberta, Canada. The first thing on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Mr. Trump met Carney at the White House last month. The rest of the day will consist of meetings with the G7 leaders, and the traditional \"family photo\" of those leaders and a cultural event.",

      "NASA is evaluating apparently successful efforts by Russian cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station to seal up small-but-persistent air leaks in a vestibule leading to an aft docking port, the U.S. space agency said Saturday.",
      "Pending additional analysis to verify the initial results, NASA said in a blog post the delayed launch of the privately-funded Axiom-4 research mission to the station could come as early as Thursday.",
      "The agency did not provide any additional launch details, but based on the space station's orbit and rendezvous requirements, a Thursday takeoff would be targeted for 4:53 a.m. EDT.",
      "If that schedule holds up, commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu would aim for a docking at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 10:30 a.m. on Friday.",
      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",

      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",

      "Another 2,000 California National Guard troops are being deployed to the Los Angeles area, the Defense Department announced Tuesday. It comes amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown in the region, which has sparked a series of at times contentious protests in downtown L.A. over the past few weeks.",
      "U.S. Northern Command said in a statement that the troops were being activated under the Title 10 law, which President Trump previously invoked when he first announced on June 7 that he was deploying National Guard troops to L.A. in response to the demonstrations.",
      "The soldiers will \"support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area,\" USNORTHCOM said in a statement.",

They will join about 2,100 National Guard soldiers and\u00a0700 Marines\u00a0who are already deployed in L.A.",

This isn't a new deployment \u2014 it's the same group of soldiers who have been diverted from critical wildfire work and work at the border, now twiddling their thumbs for Donald Trump's political theater. This is the deployment of the second set of 2000 federalized Guard soldiers, under the June 9 order. The description of what they are and aren't going to be doing is meant to be consistent with their legal position, rather than the immigration enforcement support we've seen them doing in Los Angeles.\"",

      "Local and state officials have heavily criticized Mr. Trump's move, arguing that local law enforcement were able to handle the protests, some of which turned violent, and saying the deployment of federal troops to city streets has only served to inflame the situation in L.A., a city with a large and diverse immigrant community.",
      "The downtown protests\u00a0were in response\u00a0to a series of immigration raids throughout the L.A. area.",

      "Hortman's parents, Harry and Linda Haluptzok, spoke to CBS News in their first TV interview since a suspect was arrested for the killings in Brooklyn Park, as well as for the shootings of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife five miles away in Champlin.",
      "The Haluptzoks, along with their son, Patrick Haluptzok, stopped by the Hortmans' home on Tuesday to pick up clothes for the couple to be buried in. They sat hand in hand as they spoke about the couple.",
      "\"It's been very hard the last few days,\" Patrick Haluptzok said. \"In what seems unfair and tragic, the way her last night was spent. We're just trying to get by.\"",
      "Law enforcement officials say the shooting suspect, 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, went to the Hortmans' home in the early morning of Saturday, June 14, after he allegedly shot the Hoffmans. Brooklyn Park police officers who went to the Hortmans' home confronted a gunman pretending to be a police officer, who exchanged gunshots with the real officers and fled after killing the state representative and her husband, authorities said.",
      "A search of the suspect's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, police said.",
      "Harry Haluptzok remembered the horror of that Saturday morning as \"beyond reality.\"",
      "\"We knew that they had been shot, but we couldn't find out where they were. We chased around hospitals and we couldn't find them,\" Linda Haluptzok said.",
      "\"We looked at each other and realized the reason they weren't in the hospital was because they weren't alive. And that was hard to figure out, and then we got the call,\" Harry Haluptzok said. \"It was horrible.\"",
      "Linda Haluptzok said while she was trying to find out what happened to Gilbert, the Hortmans' golden retriever that was also killed during the shooting, she told police officers, \"Please go out and find that b-word and shoot him dead.\"",
      "\"And I'm not a woman of violence, but I could not believe it. I've come to my senses since then,\" she said. \"I don't wish people dead, but I would not, I could not go to the arraignment.\"",
      "After a nearly 43-hour-long manhunt, police arrested Boelter near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County. He is charged with two counts of second-degree murder, which prosecutors say will be upgraded to first-degree murder, as well as two counts of attempted murder. Boelter is also facing six federal charges, including stalking and murder.",
      "Patrick Haluptzok told CBS News that the arrest initially felt like some relief.",
      "\"But then the police got their man, but we didn't get my sister back. My mom didn't get her baby back, and it just hurts,\" he said.",
      "While the pain is \"mind-numbing,\" Linda Haluptzok said that, in a way, Melissa and Mark Hortman are together forever. As she was going through her daughter's belongings, she found her wallet, and she said what she found inside perfectly represented who Melissa was.",
      "\"It just had her ID and a credit card, but tucked in there with that was a prayer to St. Francis Assisi,\" Linda Haluptzok said. \"'Make me a channel of your peace.' ... She meant every word that was in that prayer.\"",
      "Harry Haluptzok said his daughter treated everyone with respect, and he remembered his son-in-law as someone who was dynamic and full of life. Mark Hortman was a diver, and he loved building things; he was working on wood and metal projects.",
      "\"He was as dynamic as she was. We miss him as much as we miss her,\" Harry Haluptzok said.",
      "The couple met while volunteering as mentors in Washington, D.C., the family recalled. Three months later, they were engaged. The Hortmans had two children together, Sophie and Colin. Linda Haluptzok said she and Harry were the ones who called them to let them know about the loss of their parents.",
      "In a written statement released Monday night, Sophie and Colin Hortman said they're \"devastated and heartbroken.\" They suggested a few things people could do to honor the memory of their parents, such as plant a tree, pet a dog, bake something and share it with someone, and \"stand up for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.\"",
      "\"Those are the things they learned from their mom and dad,\" Linda Haluptzok said, adding that the family all cried as they read the statement to them the night before. \"It was like our daughter was still alive, and these thoughts that she had over the years and they kind of summarized it and it was so wonderful.\"",
      "When asked what changes they'd like to see following the tragedy, Linda Haluptzok said: \"The division needs to end.\"",
      "\"There was a time, not that long ago, when we could all work together ... and whatever steps we need to get back there. I don't know how we do it, but we all have to try.

      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",
      "Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in 2021 and of child pornography in Chicago a year later. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case and 20 years in prison in the Chicago case, which he is serving mostly simultaneously.",

    "story": [
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is in the Sherburne County Jail on Tuesday in Elk River, Minnesota, facing several federal and state charges for the shootings that killed a state representative and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife.",
      "Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot inside their Brooklyn Park home overnight Saturday. About 90 minutes before that, police say Boelter shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans were struck multiple times and are still recovering.",
      "About six years ago, Boelter was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. But what exactly does being appointed to that board mean?",
      "What we know about Boelter's appointment on workforce board",
      "State records show Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the workforce development board, first appointed by\u00a0then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016. Three years later, Walz reappointed him.",
      "A spokesperson for Walz's office gave this statement to WCCO on Tuesday:",
      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",
      "According to the workforce development board's website, it \"represents key leaders from business, education, labor, community-based organizations, and government,\" with the board providing \"a venue for workforce stakeholders building on a shared vision and mission.\"",
      "Boelter's expertise was rooted in his work as a general manager at a Speedway gas station.",
      "During Boelter's second term, which ended in January 2023, he served alongside Sen. John Hoffman. It's unclear at this point if the two worked closely.",
      "David Schultz, political science professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, says under state law, the governor appoints hundreds of people to dozens of boards across the state, ranging in topics as disparate as amateur sports, mosquito control and tourism.",
      "Schultz says appointees are unpaid and the state's boards are more technical than political, with bipartisan appointments and, essentially, citizen volunteers. The governor's role, according to Schultz, is more ceremonial.",
      "\"They're not vetted or reviewed personally by the governor. In many cases, this is done as it should be, by subordinates, you know, who then bring to the governor the recommendations,\" Schultz said. \"And this is no different than what we would find in business and industry, where we don't expect the president of most companies to be involved in the hiring for every position.\"",
      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",
      "U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, who was previously lieutenant governor under Gov. Mark Dayton and also served as his chief of staff, echoed Schultz that governors don't directly choose board appointments.",
      "\"Those workforce training councils or groups are very much not political, and the governor would often appoint people to those committees that they did not know personally, but were recommended by industry groups,\" she said in an interview with WCCO.",
      "FBI: Boelter extensively planned attacks, researched his victims",
      "The FBI says Boelter extensively planned and researched his victims. Inside his SUV left outside the Hortmans' home, police found high-powered guns and ammunition.",
      "They also found pages of handwritten notebooks with the names of more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public officials. Melissa Hortman's name was on that list, according to authorities, with her home address written next to her name.",
      "Boelter also visited the homes of two other lawmakers early Saturday. One wasn't home, and Boelter was scared away from Democratic state Sen. Ann Rest's New Hope home as police drove past him.",

      "\"By the time I hollered for everybody to get down, the first couple people had already been shot,\" Sanders told CBS News. \"\u2026I saw my son got hit. My son died on one side of me and\u2026my aunt died on the other side. He took the bullets that we ultimately was supposed to have.\"",
      "\"May God have mercy on you,\" Sanders told Roof in court back in 2015.",

      "\"I forgive you and my family forgives you,\" Thompson said in the courtroom in 2015.",
      "\"What I want people to understand is this was a divine intervention,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"OK, God called me to forgive this guy. That's when I began to heal. And then, within a few minutes, I'm light as a feather. He gave me a peace, and that's what that forgiveness did.\"",
      "Said Pinckney: \"I think forgiveness is a really hard thing and a hard concept. Instead of having a sense of hatred or animosity towards him, I honestly wish for growth for him and anyone surrounded by him. I think that hatred is such a powerful disease that unfortunately, seems to dictate the way our country is run.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

      "The so-called \"fork in the road\" deferred resignation program, which incentivized some employees to leave federal government service, reduced the manpower in the agency for an estimated savings of $470 million, according to a department budget summary reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Further reductions are planned, according to the summary, including 1,500 positions to be eliminated in the FBI. More than 700 vacant FBI agent positions are to be part of those cuts.",
      "The reductions have been championed by the new leadership inside the Justice Department.\tIn the agency's budget summary, referred to the cuts as part of a streamlining and right-sizing process.",
      "\"Capitalizing on increased efficiency, FBI will prioritize core missions of securing the border, eliminating transnational criminal organizations, reinforcing national security, and protecting the American people from violent crime,\" the department said in the summary.",

This, he said, has been \"critical to transferring hard-earned institutional knowledge.\"",
      "\"No one becomes a seasoned investigator overnight,\" Chittum said. \"We should not mortgage the future of federal law enforcement for short-term cost savings.\"",
      "Congress must still approve funding for the Justice Department, including the FBI, and will review the budget requests and recommendations submitted by the agency.",
      "The Justice Department budget summary also revealed plans to shutter the agency's Community Relations Service and eliminate all 56 of the office's positions. It was founded during the civil rights era in the mid-20th century, and its mission is to be \"America's peacemaker,\" tasked with \"preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.\"",
      "Former Justice Department official Bert Brandenburg blasted the agency's plans to close this office.\u00a0 \"Sacking expert conciliators on the eve of a summer of growing tension is like turning off fire hydrants as flames approach,\" Brandenburg told CBS News. \"This is a recipe for more chaos and more violence.\"",
      "FBI director Kash Patel has announced initiatives to relocate federal agents and staff away from Washington, D.C., and into FBI field offices elsewhere in the U.S. Former agency officials said the shifting of jobs could accelerate the number of retirements and resignations of agents in the bureau.",
      "Patel told a House subcommittee in May that relocating the positions from the District of Columbia would \"enhance investigative capacity and provide better support to Federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial partners.\"",
      "He testified that it would \"increase the investigative capacity in 49 of our 55 field offices.\"",
      "Some employees who opted for the administration's \"fork in the road\" resignation program criticized rapid and controversial changes in the agency. \tFormer Justice Department spokesman Joshua Stueve, who resigned in February, wrote in his resignation letter, \"[I]t has been an honor to serve this department under multiple administrations led by both Republicans and Democrats, each of whom have previously treated career staff with respect and dignity. It is heartbreaking to see that basic decency come to an end.\"",
      "In its Jan. 28 letter to federal employees, the White House Office of Management and Budget explained its efforts to reduce some of the federal workforce, including inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"At this time, we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity and will be afforded the protections in place for such positions,\" the letter read. \"If you choose not to continue in your current role in the federal workforce, we thank you for your service to your country and you will be provided with a dignified, fair departure from the federal government utilizing a deferred resignation program.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has ignored a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "summary": "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on whether President Trump must return control of California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in San Francisco weighed Tuesday whether President Trump can continue with his deployment of California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations and appeared skeptical of the state's arguments against the president's mobilization of more than 4,000 troops.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on a Justice Department request for it to halt a district judge's order that required Mr. Trump to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom while the court fight moves forward. Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles.",
      "Brett Shumate, an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department, said Mr. Trump's decision to call National Guard troops into federal service under a law known as Title 10 is unreviewable by courts, regardless of the facts of the case. If the panel were to side with California, he warned, \"it puts Article III judges on a collision course with the commander-in-chief.\"",
      "Shumate said that California's interpretation of the law is \"dangerous\" and would allow Newsom to issue a \"pocket veto\" of any future orders from Mr. Trump. He said it's \"essential\" that the district court's injunction be lifted and said leaving it intact would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "Shumate said that if the 9th Circuit declines to halt the district judge's order, it should allow the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "But Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for California, said Mr. Trump's order calling the National Guard into federal service sweeps too broadly. He told the court that the president failed to consider any \"modest measures\" to quell protests in Los Angeles before taking the \"grave and extraordinary step\" of calling forth the National Guard.",
      "Harbourt told the judges that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he unilaterally decided to deploy the California National Guard to Los Angeles and warned that the continued presence of troops in city streets would escalate tensions and the risk of violence.",
      "The three judges considering the Trump administration's request for a stay during the appeal are Judges Mark Bennett, Eric Miller and Jennifer Sung. Mr. Trump appointed Bennett and Miller during his first term, and former President Joe Biden tapped Sung for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Early on, Bennett appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's position that courts cannot review the president's decision to federalize the National Guard and should not second-guess his military judgments. But as the arguments continued, all three judges pressed Harbourt on his position.",
      "Bennett asked where in the law there is a requirement for the president to have considered alternative measures before exercising control of the National Guard. He also probed Harbourt on his claim that Title 10 required Mr. Trump to consult with Newsom before calling the California troops into federal service.",
      "Miller cited a state law that he said effectively makes the adjutant general of the California National Guard a \"substitute\" for the governor. Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of Guard troops, and he then issued memoranda to the adjutant general to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "The case landed before the 9th Circuit after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled last week that Mr. Trump's actions in deploying the National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles were illegal and blocked the administration from deploying the troops in the city.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed that decision, and the 9th Circuit panel issued a temporary administrative stay while it took more time to consider the issue.",
      "The legal battle involves whether the president exceeded his authority when he invoked Title 10 to call forth the California National Guard in response to protests in California's largest city. Demonstrations broke out earlier this month after immigration agents conducted raids across Los Angeles as part of the administration's efforts to crack down on immigration and execute mass deportations.",
      "Title 10 lays out three circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service: when the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; when there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the U.S.; or when the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws. It then says that orders \"shall be issued through\" the governor.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his June 7 memorandum ordering the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members that the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion,\" which allowed him to federalize the National Guard and bypass Newsom. An additional 2,000 troops were brought under federal command. Roughly 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have also been mobilized to the area to protect federal property and immigration agents during arrests.",
      "In his decision, Breyer rejected the president's claim that the demonstrations are a \"rebellion,\" writing that he is \"troubled by the implication inherent in defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.\"",
      "The protests, the judge said, \"fall far short\" of rebellion, and the administration failed to identify a \"violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole.\" The judge's order did not address the president's mobilization of the Marines to Los Angeles.",
      "In filings with the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration argued that courts do not have a role in reviewing the president's decision to deploy the troops. Even if courts could review his decision to call the National Guard into federal service, the Justice Department said the president had ample reason to determine that the protests in Los Angeles rose to the level of a \"danger\" of rebellion, one of the conditions laid out in Title 10.",
      "\"The district court's order improperly impinges on the commander in chief's supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the Held, and puts federal officers (and others) in harm's way,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",

      "\"Considered individually, defendants' legal arguments are meritless. Considered in the aggregate, they are terrifying,\" California lawyers wrote.

      "Among the issues before the 9th Circuit panel is whether the Trump administration properly notified Newsom of its order calling the National Guard into federal service. The Justice Department argued in lower court proceedings that it did because two memos calling up the National Guard went through California's adjutant general, who runs the California National Guard, and not Newsom's office, as California has argued is necessary.",

    "summary": "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two measles vaccine doses, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday counted a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "The first 20 cases did not result in hospitalizations, Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday. Those cases were in children 8 years old or younger.",
      "Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday after she spoke to CBS News.",
      "The first 20 cases also did not include people who received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis, Anton said. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized.",
      "\"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine have also been in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Colorado says many of its vaccinated cases have been in residents who were exposed during travel to other parts of the world facing large outbreaks like Canada and Europe.",
      "The state previously said it had linked multiple cases to an infectious traveler who exposed others at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight.",
      "The CDC has also issued new guidance for summer camps to prepare for the threat of measles spread this year, including urging camp operators to check for documentation of immunity among staff and children.",

Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",

      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",

      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first time, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years, just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp-up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us, because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

    "summary": "The location of the HMS Endeavour, a lost ship belonging to 18th-century British explorer Captain James Cook, has been confirmed as Rhode Island's Newport Harbor.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers have confirmed that the 18th-century British explorer Captain James Cook's lost ship found its final resting place in Rhode Island's Newport Harbor, solving a decadeslong mystery, according to the Australian National Maritime Museum.",
      "Two Australian historians, Mike Connell and Des Liddy, originally pinpointed the location of the ship, called HMS Endeavour\u00a0in 1998, the museum said in a report released earlier this month. The museum's report detailed how a 26-year archival and archaeological research program ultimately determined that the Endeavour was, in fact, at the bottom of Newport Harbor as Connell and Liddy had thought.",
      "Captain Cook famously sailed the Endeavour across the Pacific Ocean multiple times in the mid-1700s. He is remembered for his voyage to Tahiti, New Zealand and Australia, which he claimed for Britain, as well as Hawaii, where he ultimately met his fate in a dispute with indigenous residents. Cook's exploration of the islands laid the foundation for British colonization in those areas, which is why, for different reasons, it's an important part of Australian history, according to the museum's report.",
      "\"For some, the Pacific voyage led by James Cook between 1768 and 1771 embodies the spirit of Europe's Age of Enlightenment,\" the executive summary of the report reads, \"while for others it symbolises the onset of colonisation and the subjugation of First Nations Peoples.\"",
      "After Cook's death, the Endeavour returned to England, which went on to use it for transporting British troops and detaining prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. It was sold to private owners, who renamed the ship Lord Sandwich, and deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in the midst of war in 1778.",
      "When Australian maritime experts\u00a0initially announced in 2022 that they believed the Endeavour was among a number of ancient shipwrecks still scattered across Newport Harbor, the claim was widely debated. But a partnership between the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission and the Australian National Maritime Museum forged ahead with the research that eventually led to the wreck's identification. They are working to ensure that the wreck site is protected from now on.",
      "\"Given Endeavour's historical and cultural significance to Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, England, the United States of America and First Nations peoples throughout the Pacific Ocean, positive identification of its shipwreck site requires securing the highest possible level of legislative and physical protection,\" the report says.",

    "summary": "Israel's prime minister has declined to rule out assassinating Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. President Trump says he'd be an \"easy target,\" and \"our patience is wearing thin.\"",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's 86-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the figurehead of what he calls an \"existential\" threat to Israel. Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel would like to see, and even help to precipitate, a change of regime in Iran, which has been ruled by a hardline theocratic government since the 1979 Islamic revolution.",
      "On Friday, after ordering the first attacks on\u00a0Iran's nuclear sites, Netanyahu said: \"Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people. Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.\"",
      "He urged the people of Iran \"to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,\" adding, \"This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.\"",
      "Asked by ABC News in an interview that aired Monday if Israel would try to kill Khamenei, Netanyahu would only say that his country was \"doing what we need to do.\"",
      "He rejected suggestions that such a move would be escalatory, however, saying, \"It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.\"",
      "In a post on his own Truth Social media platform Tuesday, President Trump said: \"We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "Israel's strikes hit Khamenei's inner circle",
      "\"I imagine the supreme leader is currently unable to sleep and worried about whether he'll be alive or not,\" Holly Dagres, a regional expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have killed several of Iran's top generals and security advisers to the ayatollah, dealing a blow to his inner circle, which, according to the Reuters news agency, consists of only 15 to 20 trusted loyalists. The dead include the commander-in-chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran's ballistic missile program Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and spy chief Mohammad Kazemi.",
      "On Tuesday, Israel's military boasted about killing the man tapped to replace the Iranian military's chief of staff, just four days after it killed his predecessor in its first round of strikes.",
      "\"We eliminated Ali Shadmani, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime,\" Israeli military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Tuesday. \"He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation. He only managed to fill the position for 4 days.\"",
      "But even if Israel were to kill the ayatollah himself, Dagres said Iran's clerical regime has an established process in place to keep the government stable.",
      "Iran is not run by \"one man and some generals\"",
      "\"The thing with the Islamic Republic is this isn't just one man and some generals,\" Dagres told CBS News. \"This is a system or an apparatus that has been thought through very extensively. The Islamic Republic has something that's akin to the (Vatican's) College of Cardinals \u2014 the Assembly of Experts, and they actually determine who gets to be supreme leader.\"",
      "The top-level religious body, also known as Iran's Council of Experts, is composed of 88 senior Islamic clerics who are responsible for electing Iran's supreme leader, usually when the current one dies.",
      "\"From what we've been seeing so far, it doesn't sound like any of those people have been targeted\" by Israel, said Dagres. \"This is a replaceable regime in terms of leadership at the top, because they're prepared for the eventual death of a supreme leader.\"",
      "Even if Iran's entire theocratic system of government were to collapse, the upheaval would not necessarily guarantee a new government that is any friendlier to Iran's own repressed people, to Israel, or to the United States.",
      "\"There could be a scenario where the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps takes over, and they could go in different directions,\" said Dagres. \"They could be more authoritarian. They can be more Western-friendly. We don't know. I think one of the lessons of the Arab Spring, up until the fall of Assad, was that what happens isn't always better.\"",
      "Those Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings across the Middle East in 2010 \u2014 in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Tunisia \u2014 were initially met with hope in the democratic Western world, but in most of those countries, the bids for democracy either devolved into civil war, or were beaten back by new or returning authoritarian regimes or the rise of extremist groups.",
      "Could internal tension threaten Iran's regime?",
      "Echoing Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday he could suffer a fate similar to Iraq's former President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi strongman's regime fell in 2003 after nearly a quarter century. He was found hiding in a bunker by U.S. forces and was then sentenced to death by a special Iraqi tribunal and hanged for crimes against humanity.",
      "\"I warn the Iranian dictator against continuing to commit war crimes and launch missiles toward Israeli civilians,\" Katz said on Tuesday. \"He should remember what happened to the dictator in the neighboring country to Iran who took the same path against Israel.\"",
      "Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and commentator in Tel Aviv, told CBS News on Tuesday that the \"kinds of tensions that cause a regime to fall are usually internal, not external.\"",
      "\"A country of 10 million cannot precipitate a regime change in a country of 90 million,\" Pinkas noted, highlighting the vast discrepancy in size between Israel and the much larger Iran, which he noted was also 1,100 miles away.",
      "\"For that to happen, for a regime change to happen, you need basically a reenactment of the failed Iraq invasion [by the U.S.] of 2003,\" Pinkas said. \"And I don't think anyone wants that, certainly not the Americans.\"",
      "He views Netanyahu's call for Iranians to rise up against their own leadership as \"sheer arrogance.\"",
      "\"I doubt anyone living in Tehran and listening to Netanyahu would say, 'Oh, wow, you know, this is a call for action, I should get out and fight the regime because Mr. Netanyahu, a thousand miles away, told me to do so.'\"",
      "The last time mass anti-government street protests erupted in Iran was in 2022 with the so-called \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement. That outrage was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's religious police, reportedly after being detained for an improper head covering.",
      "Netanyahu has repeated the three-word protest refrain in messages aimed directly at Iranians since his country launched its attacks late last week.",
      "But those protests in Iran were quashed quickly \u2014 and aggressively \u2014 by Iranian authorities and had died down by the spring of 2023.",
      "Since Israel started bombing Iran last week, no one has taken to the streets in Iranian cities. The country's residents appear to be focusing on the immediate threat, scrambling for shelter and to evacuate major cities as Israeli bombs fall.",
      "\"Why would you be on the streets if Israeli jets are bombarding those very streets or bombarding military targets not far from you,\" noted Pinkas. \"They're driving away, as far away as possible from Tehran \u2026 but I think that when the dust settles \u2014 and that could be in two, three days, it could also be in three weeks, I honestly cannot predict that \u2014 I think a lot of that anger will be taken out on the regime.\"",
      "In other words, even if Israel's actions don't prompt an immediate toppling of Iran's Islamic rulers, it could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their clerical leaders. If that happens, it could come at one of the ayatollah's weakest moments in almost half a century.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's not just \"looking for a ceasefire\" in the Israel-Iran war. He also warned all of Tehran's residents to evacuate.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said early Tuesday morning that he wants \"a real end\" to Iran's nuclear problem, with Tehran \"giving up entirely\" its enrichment activities. He said he was not just working toward a ceasefire to end the war between Iran and Israel, which has claimed at least two dozen lives in Israel and hundreds in Iran as it enters its fifth day.",
      "\"I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after\u00a0cutting short his time at the G7 summit in Canada. \"We're looking for better than a ceasefire,\" he added.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"",
      "He did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Israel's military said it had taken full control of the airspace over Tehran.",
      "\"Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured 'stuff,'\" Mr. Trump said in his post Tuesday. \"Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump's post, administration officials had stressed that the U.S. was \"not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran.\"",
      "The president also\u00a0said earlier\u00a0that French President Emmanuel Macron had \"mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a 'cease fire' between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",
      "The president said it was possible he could send special envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, or both, to meet with Iranian negotiators, but \"it depends what happens when I get back\" to Washington.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",
      "Asked if it would take U.S. involvement to destroy Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Trump said he hoped it would be \"wiped out long before that.\"",
      "Vance says Trump has \"shown remarkable restraint\" but \"may decide he needs to take further action\"",
      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",

      "Asked on Monday why he's leaving the summit, Mr. Trump said, \"I have to be back early for obvious reasons.\"",
      "As Air Force 1 taxied before departing Canada, Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that his early return to the capital wasn't related to any Israel-Iran ceasefire talks. French President Emmanuel Macron had brought up the possibility of a ceasefire earlier, drawing criticism from Mr. Trump.",

      "Asked by reporters what he'd heard from Iran, he replied, \"They'd like to talk. But they should have done that before. I had 60 days and they had 60 days. And on the 61st day, I said, we don't have a deal. They have to make a deal.\" He went on to say, \"It's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war.

      "\"Look, we're doing what we need to do,\" he told\u00a0ABC News' Jonathan Karl. Karl, noting that Mr. Trump had rejected the idea, told Netanyahu that the president feared that assassinating Iran's supreme leader would escalate the conflict.",
      "\"It's not going to escalate the conflict,\" Netanyahu contended. \"It's going to end the conflict.\" He blamed Iran for \"bringing us to the brink of nuclear war,\" and said that \"in fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this, this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has urged Iran to sign a deal to limit the scope of its nuclear program, convening multiple rounds of talks that are now on hold.

      "When Mr. Trump met with Carney at the White House, the newly elected prime minister made it clear that Canada \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump's public musings \u2014 is not for sale.",

      "\"The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) have been located and secured,\" an official from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said in a statement late on Sunday.",
      "The hope is that the voice recorder will help investigators piece together what caused the plane to crash just minutes after it took off from Ahmedabad Airport. The cockpit voice recorder captures audio from the cockpit, including conversations between pilots, alarms and ambient sounds.",
      "A mayday call was sent by the flight captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, seconds after the London-bound plane left the runway in Ahmedabad.",
      "Rescue workers and investigators recovered the other black box, the flight data recorder, on Friday. That recorder logs reams of data from the various systems on modern passenger jets, everything from altitude and speed to engine performance. Black boxes are designed to survive crashes and are considered vital to air accident investigators in determining the cause of disasters.",
      "India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the probe into the Thursday crash of flight 171.

    "story": [
      "Residents in Spain and several other popular destinations in Europe protested against mass tourism Sunday, saying a flood of summer visitors is driving up housing costs in their cities and pushing out locals.",
      "Some of the protesters in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns.",
      "The protests were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\"The squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\" Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \"Barcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\"",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \"bubble tea\" spots.",
      "\"Our lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\"",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \"Everywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\" The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination's historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \"One more tourist, one less resident.\" They stuck stickers saying \"Citizen Self-Defense,\" in Catalan, and \"Tourist Go Home,\" in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel's doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona's main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but Wanda said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit weather.",
      "\"That's lovely, thank you sweetheart,\" she said to the squirter. \"I am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\"",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed a record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain's capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \"Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain's Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \"cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\" which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \"Your Airbnb was my home.\"",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\"I think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\" Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago, recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\"In the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\" he said.",
      "In another strategy, last year, Barcelona's leaders launched a program to replace outdated infrastructure in public schools to address rising temperatures, paid for by a tax on tourists.",
      "\"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News at the time.",
      "But some residents say the program misses the point.",
      "\"The government should be doing this without depending on tourism \u2026 it's public health,\" activist Agnes Rodriguez said. \"If you're coming to Barcelona tonight, to Chicago or to New York, and you're staying in a tourist apartment where a family should be living, you are part of this city changing. You're affecting the life of people living there.\"",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

The toll was the deadliest yet in the near-daily shootings that have taken place as thousands of Palestinians move through Israeli military-controlled areas to try to reach the food \"hubs\" run by the private contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Two witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire early Monday in an attempt to control the crowds. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military. It has said after numerous previous instances that troops had fired warning shots at what it called suspect individuals approaching their positions.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said 33 Palestinians were killed trying to reach the GHF center near the southern city of Rafah on Monday while another was fatally shot trying to reach a GHF hub in central Gaza. It said four other people were killed elsewhere in the war-torn enclave.",
      "Two Palestinians trying to get food at the Rafah site, Heba Jouda and Mohammed Abed, told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired on the crowds at around 4 a.m. at the Flag Roundabout. The traffic circle, hundreds of yards from the GHF center, has repeatedly been the scene of shootings. The military has designated specific routes to access the food centers, and GHF has warned aid-seekers that leaving the roads is dangerous, but many do in an attempt to get to the food first.",
      "Israel and the United States say the new GHF system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid. GHF says there has been no violence in or around the sites themselves. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors.",

They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, slammed GHF in a statement on Monday as a \"lethal distribution system\" and lamented that \"tragedies go on unabated\" in Gaza \"while attention shifts elsewhere,\" in an apparent reference to the new outbreak of significant fighting between Israel and Iran.",
      "Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran's nuclear sites and senior scientists and commanders late on Thursday, sparking an ongoing exchange of fire that the Israeli military says has killed at least two dozen civilians in the country, and reportedly hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"Scores of people have been killed & injured in the past days including of starving people trying to get some food from a lethal distribution system,\" Lazzarini said in a social media post. \"Restrictions on bringing in aid from the UN including @UNRWA continue despite an abundance of assistance ready to be moved into Gaza. In addition, severe shortages of fuel are now hampering the delivery of critical services especially health & water. Killings & wars will breed more wars & bloodshed. Civilians will always suffer first & suffer most.\"",

Experts, including U.N. agency chiefs, have warned that Israel's ongoing military campaign and restrictions on the entry of aid have put Gaza, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, at risk of famine.",

      "Prosecutors in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial indicated Tuesday they'd rest their case before the end of the week, nearly six weeks after the trial began.",

      "A change in timelines for the defense may signify Diddy's lawyers found \"some weaknesses\" in the government's case, according to New York-based attorney Nicole Brenecki.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' defense may begin presenting its case as early as this week, telling Judge Arun Subramanian it will only need between two and five days. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"The defense can change the amount of time allocated for their presentation of the case,\" Brenecki told Fox News Digital. \"This current change is likely based on the defense\u2019s observation of some weaknesses in the prosecution\u2019s case. We have to keep in mind that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution.",
      "\"Given that the jurors can see the case as mostly based on testimony by disgruntled ex-girlfriends and ex-employees, they may not be inclined to convict Diddy of essentially forming a criminal enterprise to commit crimes across state lines, which is a summary of the definitions of the crimes he is accused of.",

      "\"The defense does not have to put on a case at all,\" New York-based Attorney David Schwartz told Fox News Digital. \"It is up to the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendant gets every presumption of innocence. So, in many cases, the defense does not put on a case at all.",
      "\"By putting on no case or a short case, the defense is emphasizing that the prosecution did not meet its burden.",
      "\"The last thing you want to do as a defense attorney is to shift the burden by putting on a long case. The burden never shifts, but the longer the case the defense puts on, the more juries forget about the burden, which is bad.\"",

      "The new technology, called the milli-spinner thrombectomy, has been shown to have more successful outcomes for patients who have experienced strokes, as well as heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms and other clot-related diseases, according to a press release from the university.",
      "Blood clots are clumped together by thread-like proteins called fibrin. The milli-spinner \u2014 which is a long, hollow, rotating tube with a series of \"fins and slits\" \u2014 enters the body through a catheter and applies force and suction to the clot.",
      "EXPERIMENTAL CHOLESTEROL PILL CUTS HEART ATTACK RISK WITH 'CONVENIENT' ONCE-DAILY DOSE",

      "Telogen effluvium is a stress response to weight loss that affects the hair follicle, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Before weight-loss drugs, traditional bariatric surgery would lead to the loss of 70% of excess body weight in about six months, Rabito said \u2014 which was often followed by hair loss within six to nine months.",
      "\"Your body doesn't understand that this is healthy weight loss \u2014 your body thinks it's starving,\" he reiterated. \"It happens to almost everyone, to some people more than others.\"",
      "THIS DAILY BEAUTY ROUTINE COULD BE RUINING YOUR HAIR, EXPERTS WARN",

      "These vitamin deficiencies can worsen as weight loss occurs, so it's important to work with a medical professional to balance these levels, according to the doctor.",

      "\"Rinsing with cool water helps as well. Try not to do harsher treatments in the sense of lightening or coloring \u2014 spread it out as much as possible.\"",
      "Rabito noted that losing hair is \"part of the game.\" He said he always warns his patients before starting their weight-loss journey that this will most likely occur and is a \"mark of success.\"",
      "Hairstylists urge clients to check vitamin levels with their healthcare provider to help determine how best to treat their hair loss. (iStock)",
      "\"They\u2019re going to lose hair,\" he said. \"It's going to get worse before it gets better.\"",
      "\"But as long as you get the vitamins controlled, get them adequately repleted \u2014 when the patient plateaus and the weight is stable for a month or two, the body doesn't sense starvation anymore, and the body is less stressed, then the hair grows back better than ever.\"",
      "Watt said she often recommends a hair vitamin to her clients struggling with weight loss. \"Diet also has a lot to do with it,\" she noted.",

      "Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults, with about one in three Americans between 65 and 74 affected, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",
      "While some of this loss is due to the hair cells in the inner ears breaking down with age and not picking up vibrations as well, per WebMD, there are some risk factors that can be controlled with behavior modifications.",
      "Making small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise.",
      "COMMON AGING SYMPTOM COULD WORSEN LONELINESS IN SENIORS",
      "Below are some practical tips you can start implementing today.",
      "1. \u00a0Limit exposure to loud noises",
      "Whether it's a crowded concert, heavy traffic or the constant hum of power tools, repeated exposure to high noise levels is known to cause permanent damage to the delicate structures in the inner ear.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to these loud environments, the NIH states.",
      "Making small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise. (iStock)",
      "Even small adjustments, such as lowering the volume on your headphones or taking quiet breaks during a noisy event, can make a big difference over time.",
      "2. Shield your ears in noisy environments",
      "Damage to the inner ear can happen long before it shows up on a hearing test, according to the NIH, which means prevention is key.",
      "When loud situations are unavoidable, and you expect to be exposed for more than a few minutes, experts recommend wearing ear protection, such as foam earplugs or noise-canceling earmuffs.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to loud environments.",

      "Although hearing loss is common with age, it\u2019s not the only auditory issue.",
      "According to the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), conditions like tinnitus, which often peaks between ages 60 and 69, can also develop. Tinnitus causes persistent sounds such as ringing, hissing, buzzing or whooshing in the ears.",

      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details.

      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",

      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says Hugging Face has launched affordable open-source humanoid robots for home AI exploration.",
      "Hugging Face, a well-known name in AI development, is making big moves in the world of robotics. The company has just introduced two open-source humanoid robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini, designed to make advanced robotics more accessible to everyone, from researchers and developers to students and hobbyists.",

      "HopeJR is\u00a0Hugging Face's new full-size humanoid robot. It stands out for its impressive 66 actuated degrees of freedom. This means it can walk, move its arms, and perform a wide range of independent gestures, making it a versatile platform for research, experimentation, and even household tasks in the future. Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000. That is a fraction of what most full-scale humanoid robots cost, opening the door for smaller labs, schools, and dedicated enthusiasts to get involved in advanced robotics development.",

It can move its head, listen, speak, and interact with AI applications, making it a fun and practical tool for developers and educators alike.",
      "Reachy Mini is expected to cost between $250 and $300. It is designed to be a hands-on gateway into robotics, letting users build, customize, and experiment with embodied AI. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face Spaces, giving access to over 500,000 AI apps on the Hugging Face Hub.",

      "Both HopeJR and Reachy Mini are fully open source. This means anyone can assemble, rebuild, and understand how these robots work. Hugging Face's CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized that this approach helps keep robotics open and accessible rather than dominated by a handful of companies with proprietary black-box systems. The community-driven model encourages collaboration and innovation, allowing users to share their improvements and build on each other's work.",

I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",

      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Back up your important data regularly",
      "Ransomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly\u00a0back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.",
      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts. By sharing experiences and staying informed, we strengthen our community's defense against cybercrime.",

      "In the past decade, healthcare data has become one of the most sought-after targets in cybercrime. From insurers to clinics, every player in the ecosystem handles some form of sensitive information.",
      "However, breaches do not always originate from hospitals or health apps. Increasingly, patient data is managed by third-party vendors offering digital services such as scheduling, billing and marketing.",
      "One such breach at a digital marketing agency serving dental practices recently exposed approximately 2.7 million patient profiles and more than 8.8 million appointment records.",

      "Massive healthcare data leak exposes millions: What you need to know",
      "Cybernews researchers have discovered a misconfigured MongoDB database exposing 2.7 million patient profiles and 8.8 million appointment records. The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",
      "The exposed data included names, birthdates, addresses, emails, phone numbers, gender, chart IDs, language preferences and billing classifications. Appointment records also contained metadata such as timestamps and institutional identifiers.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "Clues within the data structure point toward Gargle, a Utah-based company that builds websites and offers marketing tools for dental practices. While not a confirmed source, several internal references and system details suggest a strong connection. Gargle provides appointment scheduling, form submission and patient communication services. These functions require access to patient information, making the firm a likely link in the exposure.",
      "After the issue was reported, the database was secured. The duration of the exposure remains unknown, and there is no public evidence indicating whether the data was downloaded by malicious actors before being locked down.",
      "We reached out to Gargle for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "How healthcare data breaches lead to identity theft and insurance fraud",
      "The exposed data presents a broad risk profile. On its own, a phone number or billing record might seem limited in scope. Combined, however, the dataset forms a complete profile that could be exploited for identity theft, insurance fraud and targeted phishing campaigns.",
      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data. Although Gargle is not a healthcare provider, its access to patient-facing infrastructure could place it under the scope of that regulation as a business associate.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from healthcare data breaches",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",
      "Physicist Klaus Lackner, at left, and Eric Dahlgren, co-founder and CEO of Aircela, at right\u00a0\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.",

People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",

      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

The malware turns home electronics into participants in a global network of cybercrime, often before the user even powers them on.",
      "In a statement, the FBI says BadBox 2.0 is commonly found on cheap Android-based devices manufactured in mainland China. These include uncertified tablets, connected TV boxes and other Internet of Things hardware. Many of the infected devices ship with the malware preinstalled. Others are compromised during setup, often through malicious firmware updates or sideloaded apps from unofficial marketplaces.",

      "The botnet is primarily used to turn infected devices into residential proxy nodes, providing hackers with anonymous access to real home IP addresses.

The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",
      "By March 2025, BadBox had evolved into BadBox 2.0, with more than 1 million active infections detected by HUMAN\u2019s Satori Threat Intelligence team. The majority of devices are uncertified Android Open Source Project builds.\u00a0These are not official Android TV OS products and are not protected by Google Play Protect.",

      "The FBI, working with Google, Trend Micro, HUMAN and the Shadowserver Foundation, recently disrupted communications between more than 500,000 infected devices and their control servers. However, the botnet continues to grow as more compromised products reach consumers and remain unnoticed.",
      "Symptoms of infection include strange app marketplaces, disabled Play Protect settings or devices advertised as being unlocked or capable of free streaming. Many of these products come from unknown brands and are sold through unofficial sellers.

      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",
      "Device model: TV98, X96Q_Max_P, Q96L2, X96Q2, X96mini, S168, ums512_1h10_Natv, X96_S400, X96mini_RP, TX3mini, HY-001, MX10PRO, X96mini_Plus1, LongTV_GN7501E, Xtv77, NETBOX_B68, X96Q_PR01, AV-M9, ADT-3, OCBN, X96MATE_PLUS, KM1, X96Q_PRO, Projector_T6P, X96QPRO-TM, sp7731e_1h10_native, M8SPROW, TV008, X96Mini_5G, Q96MAX, Orbsmart_TR43, Z6, TVBOX, Smart, KM9PRO, A15, Transpeed, KM7, iSinbox, I96, SMART_TV, Fujicom-SmartTV, MXQ9PRO, MBOX, X96Q, isinbox, Mbox, R11, GameBox, KM6, X96Max_Plus2, TV007, Q9 Stick, SP7731E, H6, X88, X98K, TXCZ",
      "2. Your device is not Google-certified:\u00a0If your Android device doesn't support\u00a0Google Play Protect or doesn't show the\u00a0Play Protect certification in the Play Store settings, it's likely running on an uncertified version of Android. That's a major red flag. To check:",

      "4. Google Play Protect is disabled:\u00a0If Play Protect has been turned off without your knowledge or is missing altogether, your device may be vulnerable to compromise.",
      "5. Your home internet is acting strange:\u00a0If your network is unusually slow or your router shows unknown devices connected, one of your smart devices may be hijacked and rerouting traffic as part of a residential proxy network.",

Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "It's alarming how something as simple as a budget streaming box or projector could be quietly working for cybercriminals.

      "\"We see videos of thugs trying to kick in the door with a mask or a hoodie on,\" Stanton said. \"That's what's going to happen a lot sooner than someone identifying themselves as a cop. So be prepared, not scared, and have your situational awareness of security.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A group of lawmakers spanning a broad ideological spectrum is raising alarms about the possibility of the United States taking an active role in the conflict between Israel and Iran.",
      "The emerging coalition unites strange bedfellows, including some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters and progressive Democrats, who have been vocal opponents of U.S. involvement in foreign entanglements in the years following the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, particularly without congressional approval. It could also represent a serious threat to the stranglehold Trump holds over the hard-right base of the Republican Party.",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a libertarian who has not been afraid to buck Trump on fiscal issues, is teaming up with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to attempt to force a vote on a war powers resolution that would require the administration to get approval from Congress before participating in the conflict in any meaningful way.",
      "\u201cThis is not our war,\u201d Massie wrote on X. \u201cBut if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution.\u201d",
      "His announcement led to a flood of progressive Democrats to promise they would support the legislation, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both members of \u201cthe squad.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American people aren\u2019t falling for it again. We were lied to about \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019 in Iraq that killed millions + forever changed lives,\u201d Tlaib wrote on X. \u201cIt\u2019s [unconstitutional] for Trump to go to war without a vote in Congress.\u201d",
      "Massie and Khanna also co-sponsored a similar resolution during the first Trump administration seeking to limit U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen. Trump did not sign the resolution, which passed the House and Senate, but ultimately backed off efforts for the U.S. military to take an active role.",
      "In an interview on Tuesday, Khanna predicted this issue may be the one where Trump loyalists have the resolve to break with the president.",
      "\u201cThis is core to many in the MAGA base. It\u2019s different,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIt has a different intensity than even the people who care about the deficits and are concerned about Trump\u2019s move there, or people who don\u2019t like his tariff policy.\u201d",
      "That intensity is reflected in the chorus of concern reverberating throughout the MAGA political orbit. High-profile commentators like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon have warned Trump to avoid tangling the U.S. up in what they view as a conflict that could turn into another endless war. Trump responded by calling Carlson \u201ckooky,\u201d which led Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., one of Trump\u2019s fiercest supporters on Capitol Hill, to rush to the former Fox News host\u2019s defense.",
      "Green called Carlson \u201cone of her favorite people\u201d in a post on X, before arguing that \u201cforeign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction.\u201d",
      "Khanna said a non-interventionist posture was the foundation of Trump\u2019s rise.",
      "\u201cI feel like the entire MAGA movement started as a rejection of the Bush and neocon war in Iraq. That was a central part of their identity,\u201d Khanna said.",
      "Khanna and Massie plan to introduce the measure as a privileged resolution, which would force a full House vote in a matter of days. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who is closely aligned with Trump, may have the option of revoking the privilege because it is a war powers resolution. Johnson\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on the resolution.",
      "If the resolution makes it to the House floor, Khanna acknowledged that the entire Democratic conference may not be on board.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still people in our Congress who voted for the war in Iraq. There are people who still have a very, more hawkish view on the Middle East,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a declining number.\u201d",
      "Across the Capitol, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is leading an effort to prohibit Trump from unilaterally getting the U.S. into a war with Iran, while making clear that \u201cthe question of whether United States forces should be engaged in hostilities against Iran\u201d can only be answered by Congress.\u201d",
      "Kaine questioned whether U.S. involvement is in its national security interest and that the minimum prerequisite is a debate and approval from Congress.",
      "\u201cI am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,\u201d said Kaine. \u201cThe American people have no interest in sending service members to fight another forever war in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "In terms of getting co-sponsors for his new resolution, a Kaine spokesperson said, \u201cSenator Kaine is in dialogue with colleagues.\u201d",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., didn\u2019t directly answer a question from NBC News about whether he supports the Kaine war powers resolution, saying on Tuesday, \u201cI believe Congress and Senate Democrats, if necessary, will not hesitate to exercise our authority.\u201d",
      "Kaine has credibility on the issue as an outspoken voice for reining in presidential war powers under administrations of both parties. He led an effort in the Biden administration to return that authority to Congress after years of lawmakers\u2019 ceding it to the executive branch, garnering bipartisan support for that effort.",
      "But past efforts have fallen prey to congressional malaise and run into opposition from military hawks in both parties, and early indications are that Senate Republican leaders want to support Israel.",
      "\u201cWhile the U.S. military is not involved in offensive operations against Iran, U.S. forces on land, at sea, and in the air have helped defend Israel from indiscriminate missile attacks launched by Iran,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday. \u201cPresident Trump and our country remain steadfast in our defense of Israel and committed to working toward peace in the Middle East and, first and foremost, for the safety of American personnel stationed in the region.\u201d"

      "Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout Tuesday as Israel continued to bombard the country.",
      "Two companies that track global internet connectivity, Kentinc and Netblocks, told NBC News that Iran\u2019s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world as the country becomes more deeply involved in conflict.",
      "The drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran\u2019s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran\u2019s government, said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. Most recently, in 2019, it implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.",
      "The country\u2019s internet access has been reduced, but not fully blocked, in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran last week, which Iran has said killed at least 224 people. Israel said Iran\u2019s retaliatory attacks have killed at least 24.",
      "The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks used to access foreign sites.",
      "Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, told NBC News that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, had been blocked in the country.",
      "A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran, which has been blocking internet providers used by the company.",
      "Iran\u2019s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran.",
      "Data published Tuesday by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.",
      "As internet services have been reduced in the country, some online have called for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite internet service provider, Starlink, to step in.",
      "Musk an wrote Friday on X, \u201cThe beams are on,\u201d in response to a call for Starlink access for Iranians.",
      "Iran has formally banned Starlink satellite internet terminals, and the country\u2019s Saed News Agency has warned that the use of Starlink in the country could help direct Israeli attacks.",
      "While Starlink does not formally have an option to operate within Iran\u2019s borders, it does offer users a Global Roam option, marketed for international travel. Starlink\u2019s parent company, SpaceX, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit group that advocates for information access in closed societies, said it estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink terminals are spread across Iran, based on network scans and conversations with people involved in selling them to people in the country.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s National Cybersecurity Command announced that Israel had launched a broad cyberwarfare campaign against Iran\u2019s digital infrastructure to disrupt services to the public, but it did not provide specifics of what was affected.",
      "The Iranian news site Shargh Daily reported that Iran\u2019s cyber police agency, FATA, said Tuesday that the government had imposed some internet disruptions after the cyberattacks and that service would be restored soon.",
      "The statement came after a prominent pro-Israel hacker group that calls itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram, where it maintains a social media presence, to have conducted a destructive cyberattack against Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for allegations of ties to Iran\u2019s military.",
      "Some Iranian ATMs were not functional Tuesday, a source on the ground said.",
      "The members of Predatory Sparrow are unknown, and the group did not respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to determine whether the group is affiliated with any Israeli military or intelligence agency.",
      "Bank Sepah did not respond to a request for comment."

    "summary": "More than a half-dozen potential 2028 contenders have personally experienced political violence or had to manage the response to such incidents.",
    "story": [
      "The pace of political violence has so quickly accelerated in the United States that the country is poised to field a widening group of 2028 contenders who have experienced it in some form.",
      "To date, at least a half-dozen public officials who may run for president in 2028 have either personally faced political violence, lost friends in such plots or had to manage political unrest in their states.",
      "Foisted onto the national stage by these incidents, these politicians have given the public a glimpse of how they conduct themselves in a crisis, including their ability to combat false messaging that often proliferates over social media and whether they have the capability to lead without being dragged into petty political skirmishes.",
      "The assassination over the weekend of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic leader of the Minnesota state House, and her husband was the latest episode of violence that captured national attention. Another Democratic state legislator and his wife were also shot multiple times and are recovering.",
      "It thrust Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee and potential 2028 White House hopeful, into the national spotlight, where he directed the messaging behind a major investigation and manhunt while confronting his own grief at losing \u201cthe dearest of friends.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota tragedy came as California Gov. Gavin Newsom was locked in a cross-country confrontation with the White House over its use of federal law enforcement amid protests over immigration arrests in the state.",
      "Just two months ago in Pennsylvania, an attacker firebombed Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s residence because of his position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Shapiro had already dealt with the fallout from political violence after his state handled the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler last July; the shooter also killed a man at Trump\u2019s campaign rally that day.",
      "That in turn impacted JD Vance, who had met with Trump that morning to discuss joining the ticket as his vice presidential running mate. Trump announced Vance as his pick less than 48 hours after the shooting \u2014 a move that positioned Vance, then 39, as a young prospective heir to the MAGA movement who may be eyeing the 2028 GOP presidential nomination. Trump also faced a second assassination attempt while they were running mates.",
      "And in 2020, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another Democrat on the shortlist of 2028 contenders, was the subject of a kidnapping plot.",
      "Other Democrats have had to deal with losing a close friend or colleague to the violence.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who ran in 2020 and may also be a 2028 hopeful, told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that she had dined with Hortman just hours before the assassination.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker also had an interaction with Hortman on Friday, the night he delivered an address at the Minnesota Democratic Party\u2019s annual dinner. On Monday, Pritzker was updating local news media of what he said was a \u201chodgepodge\u201d of lists that included 600 names of officials found among the belongings of Vince Boelter, the man charged in the killing of Hortman and her husband. Pritzker said he was not among those on any target list.",
      "A volatile political climate often immersed in misinformation and partisan vitriol has contributed to the spate of attacks on public office holders, political observers say. Leaders need to show in these times that they can help heal a community, turn down the temperature and even reach across the aisle.",
      "\u201cThe country has made it very clear it\u2019s sick of how divisive things are, and I think the country is sick of the violence and the example it\u2019s showing children and the pain it\u2019s causing people,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, a former Trump press secretary who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol. \u201cAnybody running for office in the future would be foolish not to consider that.\u201d",
      "Grisham, who endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year, added of Walz: \u201cHis message was absolutely spot on. It was: we should be able to have a conversation with our neighbors.\u201d",
      "She said the repudiation of such acts \u201cshould be loud, and it should be Republicans and Democrats who can\u2019t stand each other, standing side by side, to say, \u2018Yes, we disagree vehemently, but that doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to hurt a human being.\u2019\u201d",
      "Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who advised Klobuchar in her 2020 presidential campaign, pointed to Saturday\u2019s \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests across the country as a model for constructive dissent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a call to get back to a place where we could have our differences, but do it in a civil way in elections that are free and open for everybody who is a citizen,\u201d he said of the protests that drew hundreds of thousands but remained peaceful.",
      "\u201cI think the more partisan Democrats get about the messaging as it relates to the political violence, the less helpful it is both to the country as a whole, but also to the prospects of winning in 2028,\u201d Giangreco said.",
      "For Newsom, the message he sent to his constituents was to demonstrate peacefully. And to the wider national audience, both the governor and his office deluged information spaces, either to correct false narratives or combat negative messaging coming from the White House.",
      "\u201cThis is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next,\u201d Newsom said in a major address he framed as the president sending Marines to his state to try to provoke violent clashes. \u201cDemocracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.\u201d",
      "Trump officials boasted about images coming from California, saying they were \u201chappy to have this fight,\u201d and Trump gave the green light for law enforcement to take aggressive action. \u201cIf they spit, we will hit,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is really tragic to be in a situation where it is the right thing to do in these situations, to basically make sure that Republicans aren\u2019t able to step in there and set a false narrative,\u201d said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century, a pro-Democratic group.",
      "He said one of the more dangerous contributions to an era of political violence in recent years came in January, when Trump pardoned or offered commutations to those involved in the Capitol attack. That included individuals convicted \u2014 and some who even pleaded guilty to \u2014 attacking law enforcement officers.",
      "\u201cThese groups have a sense that they are effectively above the law because the president will pardon them for their crimes,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cAnd I believe that is done as an intimidation technique.\u201d",
      "Trump likewise recently brought up the prospect of pardoning those convicted in the plot targeting Whitmer, saying he would \u201ctake a look at\u201d pardoning the men involved and said the trial \u201clooked to me like somewhat of a railroad job.\u201d Whitmer said she was disappointed with Trump\u2019s remarks.",
      "Prosecutors said that two men convicted in the kidnapping scheme wanted to grab Whitmer and hang her.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t forget the most important thing \u2014 these defendants were outside a woman\u2019s house in the middle of the night with night vision goggles and guns and a plan to kidnap her. And they made a bomb. That\u2019s real enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201d a federal prosecutor said in closing arguments.",
      "\u201cWhen the president was shot at in Pennsylvania, I was one of the first people on either side of the aisle to condemn it,\u201d Whitmer said last month at the Mackinac Policy Conference in Michigan. \u201cWe have to condemn political violence, no matter where it comes from, no matter who it\u2019s aimed at. It does a disservice to everyone if we do anything short of that.\u201d",
      "Another potential Republican 2028 candidate touched by violence is Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had been so shaken by the Capitol attack by Trump supporters that he deemed it \u201cone of the saddest days in our history\u201d and a \u201cnational embarrassment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith our increasingly heated rhetoric and our wild conspiracies, our politics has been playing with fire for a long, long time,\u201d Rubio said at the time.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u2014 who is also discussed as a 2028 candidate \u2014 and Klobuchar were also present during the violent assault on the Capitol that day.",
      "The toxicity and divisiveness that have exploded in America over the last decade have led to a steady rise in threats to members of Congress. Last year, the Capitol Police saw an 18% increase to their threat assessment section load, investigating 9,474 concerning statements and direct threats against members of Congress, their families or their staff members. In 2021, threats surpassed that number after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, when police investigated 9,625 threats. On Monday, a 25-year-old Georgia man was arraigned on federal charges of making violent threats against Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Deb Fischer, R-Neb., the Justice Department said.",
      "\u201cWhen someone attacks an individual \u2014 like this weekend, like Gov. Shapiro, like Steve Scalise several years ago \u2014 that is an attack not just on a political ideology, it is an attack on public service,\u201d said former Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., who is now a fellow with the Center for American Progress. \u201cEveryone can relate to that. Everyone can feel for that. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s more important than ever that people be very careful about the message.\u201d",
      "Jones, who prosecuted the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in which four young girls of the Black church were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan, said he sees parallels to today\u2019s volatile climate and the civil rights era. Politicians need to remember that violence begets violence, Jones warned, so even condoning small acts of violence can have a tragic impact.",
      "\u201cThat bombing took place in part because of the rhetoric of an Alabama governor and a racist police commissioner that was giving a permission structure to a group of folks that was basically: \u2018Do what you want to because we\u2019re not going to really look at it,\u2019 I am absolutely convinced of that,\u201d Jones said.",
      "After facing his own interactions with law enforcement, Shapiro posted a message on social media Saturday upon hearing of the  politically motivated shootings in Minnesota.",
      "\u201cLeaders across our country must speak and act with the moral clarity this moment demands,\u201d Shapiro tweeted. \u201cThis is unacceptable \u2014 we all have a responsibility to stand up and work to defeat the political violence that is tearing through our country. America is better than this.\u201d",
      "Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida who works with a bipartisan group that recruits candidates for the state Legislature, said the threats against public officials could have a paralyzing effect.",
      "\u201cOne of the unspoken tragedies of this is it\u2019s just going to make that much harder for good people to be willing to raise their hand and enter public service,\u201d he said.",
      "Schale said that part of Joe Biden\u2019s success in 2020 was as an antidote to chaos and that a similar dynamic could play out in 2028. \u201cCandidates who can speak to these fears and then speak in a unifying fashion, I think will probably do well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more importantly, I just think all of us who have a platform at any level have to take more responsibility for what we say and how we contribute to it.\u201d",
      "For Vance, last year\u2019s failed assassination attempts on Trump provided Republicans with a rallying cry: \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 the words Trump defiantly offered after his ear was bloodied in Butler. Vance spoke about his reaction to the Butler attempt during an interview last fall with podcast host Joe Rogan. He recalled that he was playing mini-golf with his young children in Ohio at the time and that his \u201cfight or flight\u201d instincts went into effect: He went home to \u201cload all my guns, and basically stand like a sentry at our front door.\u201d",
      "After the Minnesota shootings, Vance called Walz, his opponent in last year\u2019s vice presidential debate, to express condolences, a source familiar with the call told NBC News.",
      "Trump condemned the Minnesota slayings on his social media platform.",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "However, he refused to call Walz after the Saturday slayings, shootings of two others and subsequent manhunt. Instead, he insulted the governor.",
      "\u200b\u200b\u201cWhy would I call him? I could call and say, \u2018Hi, how you doing?\u2019 The guy doesn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Trump said of Walz. \u201cHe\u2019s a mess. So I could be nice and call, but why waste time?\u201d",
      "Walz made clear, over X, who did reach out to offer support.",
      "\u201cMy thanks to Premier Doug Ford of Ontario who called to express his condolences to the Hortman family and the people of Minnesota,\u201d he said.\u201d In times of tragedy, I\u2019m heartened when people of different views and even different nations can rally together around our shared humanity.\u201d"

      "Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s new album cover has rekindled one of the classic debates around pop culture and sexuality: Satire or subjugation? Empowerment or degradation? Or is the debate itself the point?",
      "The pop star, who burst into the mainstream last year, released the cover art for her upcoming album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d last week. The image shows Carpenter on all fours while someone just out of frame pulls her hair.",
      "Carpenter, 26, has courted controversy for a while with her open embrace of sex and sexuality in her music and live performances. Last year, a New York City priest was disciplined after she filmed a music video at his church. Many of Carpenter\u2019s televised appearances have been met with backlash.",
      "That all paled in comparison to the debate that has erupted in recent days.",
      "\u201cMy entire timeline is either people talking about Israel and Iran or Sabrina Carpenter with the exact same level of intensity,\u201d one user on X quipped.",
      "Few corners of the internet have been left untouched. On Reddit, TikTok and Instagram, social media users have argued about what to make of the cover, with a range of takes including whether the cover image was a brilliant subversion of misogyny or whether it was setting women back. The conversation became so mainstream that even the hosts of \u201cThe View\u201d weighed in Thursday, asking whether the cover is \u201csending the wrong message.\u201d",
      "To many, the image is satire, a continuation of many of the themes of Carpenter\u2019s lyrics and music videos, which often mix humor, love, regret and a dose of resentment for the men in her life. In \u201cManchild,\u201d the first single off her new album released just ahead of the cover, Carpenter jokes about liking all her men \u201cincompetent.\u201d",
      "Others have called the image anti-feminist, saying it plays into misogynistic gender roles in which women must be subservient to men. Some online said the image was reminiscent of domestic abuse, while others simply called it degrading for a woman to be on all fours having her hair pulled. Still others said that Carpenter risked playing into the male gaze even if she was attempting to subvert it.",
      "One video on TikTok with more than 2.4 million views took the conversation even deeper \u2014 and more critical.",
      "\u201cI feel like this Sabrina Carpenter album cover, people are like \u2018She\u2019s the exception. Can\u2019t a girl be sexy? Can\u2019t a girl just like sex?\u2019 Sure. Sure, she can,\u201d Megan Cruz, a culture commentator, said in the video. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to ignore the entire historical precedence that has gotten us here to this moment \u2026 we have come to accept such spineless, f------ nothing art.\u201d",
      "Despite the online debate over the album cover, \u201cManchild\u201d debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100, a first for Carpenter.",
      "While Carpenter herself has not weighed in on the discussions around the image, she recently told Rolling Stone that she can\u2019t remember a time when women were dissected so seriously.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pessimistic, but I truly feel like I\u2019ve never lived in a time where women have been picked apart more, and scrutinized in every capacity. I\u2019m not just talking about me. I\u2019m talking about every female artist that is making art right now,\u201d she said.",
      "For about as long as pop music has existed, arguments about its deleterious effects have raged, and the scrutiny hasn\u2019t been entirely confined to female artists. Elvis Presley\u2019s hip sways in the 1950\u2019s \u2014 beamed into homes through the then-new technology of television \u2014 generated moral outrage. By the 1980s, Madonna was on her way to becoming a lightning rod for controversy, launching heated debates on everything from misogyny and sexuality to religious panic that set a new standard for how a pop star could drive intense and important societal discussions.",
      "More recently, Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera have been criticized for veering away from their \u201cgood girl\u201d image.",
      "\u201cMusical performers in the U.S. in particular have long courted controversy, and people have been critiquing the music, music industry and sexualization of women for decades,\u201d said Brooke Erin Duffy, an associate professor in the department of communication at Cornell University.",
      "The criticism of Carpenter follows a similar pattern to what pop stars who came before her faced and reflects a cultural swing back to more conservative ideals.",
      "\u201cI mean, come on, look at social media,\u201d said Patrick Johnson, an assistant professor of journalism and media studies at Marquette University. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the trad wives that are everywhere. You\u2019ve got the \u2018Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.\u2019 Like, you\u2019ve got this really interesting return, much like you saw in the mid-90s, much like you saw post=Woodstock, much like you saw post mid-50s, much like you saw post roaring-20s.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Carpenter did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Perry B. Johnson, adjunct faculty at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication, said that the question of what is appropriate is sometimes more harshly applied to women who were child stars, particularly those who came from children\u2019s television networks like the Disney Channel, where Carpenter starred in \u201cGirl Meets World.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a desire to separate oneself from that, like, super family-friendly framing,\u201d said Johnson, who specializes in music and culture. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a natural progression of anyone\u2019s maturation, but also because of the way that the industry likes to confine people into particular versions of themselves, or at least personas of themselves.\u201d",
      "Carpenter\u2019s music has long been sexually charged. At her concerts, during the song \u201cJuno\u201d she hands out a pair of fluffy handcuffs, and later sings \u201cWant to try out some freaky position? Have you ever tried this one?\u201d while miming a sex act. During her song \u201cBed Chem,\u201d she goes behind a curtain and mimes a sex act with a dancer while in silhouette. Older songs like \u201cNonsense\u201d from \u201cemails i can\u2019t unsend\u201d also heavily play with ideas of sex and sexuality.",
      "In her Rolling Stone interview, Carpenter said that people might expect more support for women from other women, but that has not been her experience.",
      "She also said that her most popular work is usually when she\u2019s singing about her sex life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always so funny to me when people complain,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018All she does is sing about this.\u2019 But those are the songs that you\u2019ve made popular. Clearly you love sex. You\u2019re obsessed with it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After weeks of stops and starts, Senate Republicans teamed up with a bloc of Democrats on Tuesday to pass a landmark cryptocurrency bill that would establish the first regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins.",
      "The vote on the GENIUS Act was 68-30, with 18 Democrats joining most Republicans in favor. Just two Republicans \u2014 Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 voted against it.",
      "The vote was the first time that the Senate has passed major legislation regulating digital assets.",
      "\"With this bill, the United States is one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., the author of the GENIUS Act, said in a floor speech. \"This bill will cement U.S. dollar dominance, it will protect customers, it will drive demand for U.S. treasuries.\"",
      "\"Today will be remembered as an inflection point for innovation in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "The GENIUS Act now heads to the Republican-led House, which has been working to pass its own bipartisan bill focused on creating a regulatory framework for digital assets.",
      "Washington continues to wrestle with how best to regulate the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry. Democrats have been divided over the issue, with some in the party pushing Congress to do more to rein in an industry they see as rife with conflicts of interests for President Donald Trump and his family.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee passed an earlier version of the GENIUS Act in April, with backing from five Democrats. But Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the Democrats \u2014 along with two Republicans \u2014 blocked the bill from advancing on the floor in May as they demanded stronger national security and anti-money laundering provisions.",
      "A group of bipartisan negotiators \u2014 Hagerty and Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md.; and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. \u2014 later struck a deal on changes to the bill that addressed key sticking points for Democrats.",
      "The changes called for consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, and they would extend ethics standards to special government employees.",
      "The bipartisan deal unlocked support from a broader group of Democrats, and the legislation advanced on the floor after it cleared the 60-vote threshold.",
      "\u201cI think because we worked so hard and so long with them that it got a few more of them to \u2018yes.\u2019 And so I think this is a real legislative victory,\u201d Lummis told NBC News before the vote. \u201cThey did get more of what they wanted. They should be voting yes, because they were extremely influential in shaping the legislation.\u201d",
      "But other Democrats were frustrated that nothing in the revised legislation would explicitly prevent Trump and his family from continuing their crypto ventures. New financial disclosure forms reveal that Trump made one of his largest fortunes last year, $57.3 million, on his family\u2019s cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.",
      "\"This is a bill that was written by the industry that will supercharge the profitability of Donald Trump's crypto corruption, while it undercuts consumer protection and weakens our national defense,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told NBC News.",
      "The legislation does include language that would \u201cprohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service.\u201d",
      "But Warren argued that the legislation isn't strong enough to prevent terrorists, drug traffickers and other criminals from using stablecoins for illicit purposes.",
      "The bill \"is in a better place, but it's not in a good enough place,\" she said."

      "On Tuesday, Florida won its second consecutive Stanley Cup title by outlasting Edmonton in a repeat of last year\u2019s final, winning 5-1 in Game 6 to continue its nearly overnight transformation into one of hockey's most successful franchises. It was the third straight season Florida had played for a title, a run that coincides with the hiring of coach Paul Maurice.",
      "Edmonton won the series opener in overtime, only for Florida to rebound with wins in Game 2, in double overtime, and Game 3. When Edmonton evened the series with an overtime win in Game 4, Florida took a 3-2 series lead by winning Game 5.",
      "The Panthers then closed out a series full of tight games with a blowout that began with Sam Reinhart's unassisted goal in the first period. A goal by Matthew Tkachuk pushed the lead to 2-0, and Reinhart scored the next three goals to turn the closeout opportunity into a 5-0 rout. Reinhart's four goals tied Maurice Richard's in 1957 for a Stanley Cup Final record. It was the second straight year Reinhart played hero for Florida, after he scored the game-winning goal in last season's Game 7 victory.",

      "With its 4-2 series win, Florida is the 10th franchise to win consecutive championships and the first since Tampa Bay in 2020-21. The championship extended the Panthers\u2019 run, continued the league\u2019s southern shift and continued Canada\u2019s championship drought to 32 years, with Montreal the last Canadian champion, in 1993. Eight teams from Canada have made the Stanley Cup Final since, only to come up short.",
      "Since 2004, when Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup, 10 of the past 21 champions have come from the Sun Belt, extending from Los Angeles to Florida. The four Stanley Cup titles won by the state of Florida alone in the last five years is as many as Canada has produced in the last 37.",
      "To win its second Stanley Cup, Florida had to overcome a choppy regular season in which it finished with only the Eastern Conference\u2019s fifth-highest point total and fifth-best goal differential. A repeat meeting of last year\u2019s finalists was hardly a foregone conclusion, as Edmonton endured its own inconsistency while finishing with the sixth-most points in the Western Conference.",

    "story": [
      "An actor and screenwriter has accused Tyler Perry of sexual harassment, alleging in a lawsuit that the media mogul repeatedly made unwanted advances and sought to cover up an assault with an offer to develop a show.",
      "The 46-page complaint, which was filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court and seeks punitive damages totaling $260 million, compares the allegations to those against other well-known entertainment industry figures accused of sexual misconduct.",
      "\u201cMr. Perry\u2019s success has led him to believe that money and influence can get him whatever he wants,\u201d the complaint says, adding: \u201cMr. Perry sought the one thing his wealth and influence could not purchase \u2014 a sexual relationship with a man who would remain silent.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a lawyer for Perry accused the plaintiff, Derek Dixon, of trying to get close to Perry \u201cfor what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam. But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\u201d",
      "According to the lawsuit, Perry offered Dixon \u2014 who at the time worked for an events company \u2014 his first acting role in 2019. A few months later, he invited Dixon to his home in Georgia and served him several drinks before he told him to stay in his guest room, according to the suit.",
      "Perry suddenly appeared in Dixon\u2019s bed and began groping him, according to the suit.",
      "\u201cDixon kept informing Perry that he was not into sex in order to keep Perry at bay while at the same time not insulting the person who was dangling his career in front of him,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Perry continued to text Dixon about his sex life, according to the suit, which says that the more Dixon ignored Perry the more aggressive he became. After Dixon quit his job and took a role on Perry\u2019s show \u201cThe Oval,\u201d the suit says, Perry would ask about his sexual preferences, go on sexually explicit rants and call or text him almost daily, treating him as his on-call \"pet.\"",
      "Dixon\u2019s character in \u201cThe Oval\u201d was scripted to be shot at the end of the season, but according to the suit, Perry indicated that he might survive the shooting and appear in future seasons if Dixon did a \u201cgood job.\u201d",
      "\u201cDixon immediately understood his job security depended on his \u2018relationship\u2019 with Perry,\u201d according to the suit, which adds that Perry warned Dixon not to discuss any of their conversations with castmates or tell them about their friendship.",
      "The suit accuses Perry of groping Dixon twice in 2020, including during a cast trip to the Bahamas. In 2021, at Perry\u2019s house, Perry pulled down Dixon\u2019s underwear and \u201cbegan to vigorously grab, grope, and play with Dixon\u2019s buttocks in a sexual manner,\u201d the suit says, adding, \u201cDixon was naked, stunned and seized by tremendous fear.\u201d",
      "After the alleged assault, the suit says, one of Perry\u2019s lawyers told Dixon that \u201cChristmas came early\u201d because he had done a good job on \u201cThe Oval.\u201d He was given a raise for the following season, according to the suit, and Perry wanted to buy the rights to shoot a pilot for a script Dixon had written, called \u201cLosing It.\u201d",
      "The suit says Dixon struggled with the decision about whether he should go public with allegations of sexual assault or accept Perry\u2019s money. He ultimately \u201cbowed to the pressure,\u201d the suit says, and sought to advance his career.",

      "Federal officials have apprehended one of two detainees who were still missing after their escape from an immigration detention center in New Jersey last week, the FBI says.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Franklin Norberto Bautista Reyes was found. The search was ongoing Tuesday for another escaped detainee, Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon. A $25,000 reward is being offered in the case.",
      "A total of four initially escaped Newark\u2019s Delaney Hall facility, where ICE has been holding individuals facing possible deportation, last Thursday. One was captured in Passaic on Saturday, by the FBI and ICE, and a second was taken into custody Sunday.",
      "The developments come as President Trump directs federal authorities to intensify ICE operations nationwide, particularly in Democrat-run cities.",
      "Still at large?",
      "Andres Pineda-Mogollon of Colombia overstayed a tourist visa and entered the U.S. in 2023, DHS says. He was arrested previously on local petty larceny and residential burglary charges. His last known address was in Newark, New Jersey, and he is known to have ties to Queens, New York.",
      "Investigators say the four inmates escaped by kicking a wall at Delaney Hall, a wall Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said the operator did not have a permit to build.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim called the construction \u201cessentially just dry wall with some mesh inside that led to an exterior wall. It shows just how shoddy how construction was here.\u201d",
      "The men ended up in a parking lot and hopped a fence. Kim says officials in charge of Delaney Hall are examining other walls that might be vulnerable.",
      "Local and state authorities are assisting with the investigation.",
      "\u201cAdditional law enforcement partners have been brought in to find these escapees and a BOLO [be on the lookout] has been disseminated,\u201d DHS has said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage the public to call 911 or the ICE Tip Line: 866-DHS-2-ICE if they have information that may lead to the locating of these individuals.\u201d",

      "Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged in a criminal complaint with two assault counts stemming from a May 9 visit to the center. She was indicted on Tuesday; the indictment includes three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials.",

    "story": [
      "BOSTON \u2014 A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from limiting passport sex markers for many transgender and nonbinary Americans.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s ruling from U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick means that transgender or nonbinary people who are without a passport or need to apply for a new one can request a male, female or \u201cX\u201d identification marker rather than being limited to the marker that matches the gender assigned at birth.",
      "In an executive order signed in January, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order said a person is male or female and rejected the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender.",
      "Kobick first issued a preliminary injunction against the policy last month, but that ruling applied only to six people who joined with the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit over the passport policy.",
      "In Tuesday\u2019s ruling she agreed to expand the injunction to include transgender or nonbinary people who are currently without a valid passport, those whose passport is expiring within a year, and those who need to apply for a passport because theirs was lost or stolen or because they need to change their name or sex designation.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The government failed to show that blocking its policy would cause it any constitutional injury, Kobick wrote, or harm the executive branch\u2019s relations with other countries.",
      "The transgender and nonbinary people covered by the preliminary injunction, meanwhile, have shown that the passport policy violates their constitutional rights to equal protection, Kobick said.",
      "\u201cEven assuming a preliminary injunction inflicts some constitutional harm on the Executive Branch, such harm is the consequence of the State Department\u2019s adoption of a Passport Policy that likely violates the constitutional rights of thousands of Americans,\u201d Kobick wrote.",
      "Kobick, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, sided with the ACLU\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.",
      "\u201cThe Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,\u201d Kobick wrote in the preliminary injunction issued earlier this year. \u201cThat standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. The government has failed to meet this standard.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, the ACLU described how one woman had her passport returned with a male designation while others are too scared to submit their passports because they fear their applications might be suspended and their passports held by the State Department.",
      "Another mailed in their passport Jan. 9 and requested to change their name and their sex designation from male to female. That person was still waiting for their passport, the ACLU said in the lawsuit, and feared missing a family wedding and a botany conference this year.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration argued that the passport policy change \u201cdoes not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.\u201d It also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed since they are still free to travel abroad."

      "A federal judge found Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in civil contempt Tuesday after he snubbed a court order in a high-profile immigration case and then boasted about it in interviews.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams wrote that Uthmeier offered \"a series of implausible interpretations of the language he used\" to argue he was complying with the order and that those interpretations were not believable.",
      "\"Litigants cannot change the plain meaning of words as it suits them, especially when conveying a court\u2019s clear and unambiguous order,\" Williams wrote, ordering Uthmeier to file biweekly reports showing he's complying with her order or risk further court actions.",
      "Uthmeier's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Williams has been presiding over a case challenging immigration laws signed this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis that make it a misdemeanor for anybody in the country illegally to enter or re-enter the state. She issued a restraining order in April barring enforcement, and Uthmeier sent out a notice to state agencies informing them of the order, adding that he disagreed with it and intended to appeal.",
      "Five days later, on April 23, he sent the law enforcement agencies a second notice, saying his office had submitted a court filing challenging the restraining order.",
      "\"Judge Williams ordered my office to notify you of the evolving scope of her order, and I did so,\" he wrote. \"But I cannot prevent you from enforcing [the challenged laws], where there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so. As set forth in the brief my office filed today, it is my view that no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida\u2019s new illegal entry and reentry laws.\"",
      "Williams asked why she shouldn't find Uthmeier in contempt, and he contended that he hadn't violated her order because he hadn't enforced the new laws and that he had notified state agencies about her order.",
      "Williams noted that he struck a far more defiant tone in media interviews.",
      "\"This judge is considering whether or not to hold me in contempt. But I am not going to rubber-stamp her order. I\u2019m not going to direct law enforcement to stand down on enforcing the Trump agenda and carrying out Florida\u2019s law,\" Williams quoted him as saying in a May 6 interview.",
      "\"I'm not going to bow down,\" he added.",
      "In another interview two days later, Uthmeier said that \"she\u2019s issuing this order and saying you gotta tell them all to stand down. I\u2019m not gonna do that.\"",
      "Williams said the comments were \"relevant\" because \"Uthmeier\u2019s repeated reinforcement of his message that law enforcement is not bound, intentional or not, increases the chance of harm from his continued noncompliance.\"",
      "\"To be clear, the Court is unconcerned with Uthmeier\u2019s criticism and disapproval of the Court and the Court\u2019s Order. But respect for the integrity of court orders is of paramount importance,\" Williams wrote.",
      "She said he \"is free to broadcast his continued appeal of the Court\u2019s injunction and his view that the Court\u2019s rulings are erroneous. However, when instructed to inform law enforcement that they are proscribed from enforcing an enjoined law, he may not tell them otherwise.\"",
      "She ordered him to file biweekly reports on whether there have been any arrests or detentions under the new laws. \"Finally, if Uthmeier does not comply with these remedial sanctions, the Court will consider further sanctions, including fines and fees to compensate Plaintiffs for costs of enforcing the Court\u2019s order.\""

      "Democrats are wrestling with their strategy on cryptocurrency, a once underground industry that has become a powerful player on Capitol Hill \u2014 and closely associated with President Donald Trump.",
      "Cryptocurrency groups scored a major win in Washington on Tuesday, with the Senate passing a landmark bill to regulate some digital assets. It was a bipartisan vote, with 18 Democrats joining nearly every Republican to support the bill following an intense lobbying and advocacy effort.",
      "But the battle over the legislation has exposed deep Democratic divisions over how to handle the broader issue of crypto in a GOP-controlled Washington. While some Democrats have pushed for the party to be leading the charge on developing policy for the quickly emerging industry, others have been wary of embracing a tool that they say has created conflicts of interest for Trump. Newly released financial disclosures show Trump made one of his largest fortunes last year, $57.3 million, on his family\u2019s cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial.",
      "Progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking committee, said the GENIUS Act \u2014 the bill the Senate passed that would establish the first regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar \u2014 would create a \u201csuperhighway\u201d for corruption in the Trump White House.",
      "Warren also lamented to NBC News that the crypto industry is \u201cpouring money in to try to influence votes here in Congress.\u201d",
      "But other Democrats see this is a rare chance for Congress to get ahead of an issue, arguing they can\u2019t afford to wait until they win back power in Washington to act \u2014 especially with how quickly technology moves.",
      "\u201cI think every politician will say this. It\u2019s the same thing about any industry that they don\u2019t like or understand,\u201d Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who supports the GENIUS Act, told NBC news in an interview.",
      "Democrats clash over crypto behind closed doors",
      "The GENIUS Act now heads to the House, where the Democratic divide over cryptocurrency \u2014 which can often fall along generational lines \u2014 came to a head during a private meeting last week attended by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., other Democratic leaders and committee ranking members, according to three sources who were in the room and a fourth source who was briefed on the meeting.",
      "Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., who is running for the Senate, expressed her support for the industry and a recent bipartisan bill called the Clarity Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for digital assets, according to three of the sources.",
      "The 53-year-old Craig serves in the House Agriculture Committee as the top Democrat, and 86-year-old Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is the ranking member in the Financial Services Committee. Waters opposes the legislation and instead wants to bar Trump from benefiting from the digital assets Congress could legitimize.",
      "Waters expressed those concerns in the Wednesday meeting, three of the sources said. Other members agreed, including Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "Both Himes and Waters stressed a need for greater insider trading protections in the bill, the three sources said. The lawmakers said Democrats should not enable Trump to get wealthy off of unfettered access to the industry he wants Congress to regulate.",
      "Craig argued Trump was already bound by existing laws, one of the sources said. Waters began talking over Craig, who told the room that she was in the middle of speaking, leading to a heated discussion, the source said.",
      "As this episode was unfolding, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., suggested that perhaps Democrats should act to ban the industry altogether, two sources added \u2014 an example of just how wildly far apart some Democrats are on the issue.",
      "Jeffries moved to table the discussion for another time, the three sources said. After the meeting, both Waters and a Craig spokespersons declined to comment, saying the meeting was private. Jeffries\u2019 office also declined to comment on a private meeting. A spokesperson for Scott did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Craig, whose re-election campaign received a big boost from groups associated with the industry last year, has backed a check on Trump. During the Agriculture Committee markup on the Clarity Act, Rep. Eugene Vindman, D-Va., offered an amendment targeting entities that hold meme-based assets associated with the president, vice president or other public officials. All 24 Democrats on the panel, including Craig, backed the amendment; Republicans successfully voted it down.",
      "Crypto groups spent big bucks on the last election",
      "Looming over the Democratic debate is the fact that groups associated with the crypto industry were heavily involved in the last election.",
      "Fairshake, a crypto-focused super PAC that formed in 2023, spent $195 million in the 2024 elections. And the group already has $116 million in cash on hand for the 2026 midterm election cycle, according to the group\u2019s spokesperson, Josh Vlasto.",
      "\u201cWe are keeping our foot on the gas and all options are on the table,\u201d Vlasto told NBC News.",
      "Crypto groups supported candidates from both parties in 2024, but they also spent $40 million to oppose then-Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who was ultimately defeated by Republican Bernie Moreno. That race is still lingering in the air among Democrats who fear that kind of cash being used against them.",
      "The cryptocurrency industry has also dialed up its lobbying and grassroots advocacy efforts in recent years.",
      "Stand With Crypto, an advocacy group, launched a campaign around the passage of the GENIUS Act encouraging people to call or email their senators in support of the bill. The effort resulted in 75,000 emails being sent to members, according to the organization.",
      "The group also organized so-called fly-in meetings ahead of key votes on the bill in order to link members with constituents who utilize crypto.",
      "Stand With Crypto has not made any election endorsements, but it is leaving itself the room to do so in the future. In the meantime, the group created a \u201cscorecard\u201d that tracks how members fare on key votes and has been arguing to lawmakers that an increasing number of voters care about crypto.",
      "\u201cFor these folks that are afraid of [crypto] people donating money, that\u2019s not really what we do. But what they should be concerned about is our voters voting differently, because these votes are up for grabs,\u201d Mason Lynaugh, community director for Stand With Crypto, told NBC News. \u201cA lot of these people were not civically engaged before, and I don\u2019t know if the genie\u2019s going back in the bottle.\u201d",
      "Even though Democrats are far from united on the topic, the industry has made some key allies in the party.",
      "\u201cWe are here to legislate, and again, to try to bring into compliance an economy that is largely outside the United States is uncontrollable at this point,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the responsibility of us as Congress to put down the rules of the road.\u201d",
      "Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who also supports the GENIUS Act, said he voted for the bill because many of his constituents already use crypto.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already using these products. And so from a public policy point of view, one of the questions for me, is, what will leave the consumers in a better place? So we clearly need some kind of regulatory structure,\u201d Warnock told NBC news.",
      "Asked if the industry is pumping too much money into elections, Warnock replied: \u201cI think there\u2019s too much money in our system whether you\u2019re talking about oil and gas or the gun industry, it\u2019s a serious democracy problem.\u201d"

      "In Washington and across the country, lawmakers express safety fears",
      "After the targeted shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers, elected officials serving in Capitol buildings in Washington and around the country are growing increasingly worried about the level of protection they receive.",
      "In Congress: Law enforcement officials have been holding security briefings with members of Congress over the past several days, Scott Wong, Julie Tsirkin and Melanie Zanona report. Federal lawmakers have been told that they can spend money from their office budgets on home security systems and campaign cash on private security. Only a handful of congressional leaders get 24-hour protection from Capitol Police security details. Members can request extra protection, which is assigned based on whether Capitol Police determine there is an active threat.",
      "But so far, those assurances have done little to calm nervous lawmakers, who have been harboring such concerns amid a string of violent attacks on American politicians over the past 15 years \u2014 a period that has included assassination attempts on a presidential candidate and members of Congress and a riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "House Democratic leaders have asked Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to boost members\u2019 official budgets \u201cto support additional safety and security measures in every single office.\u201d And over the weekend, House Republicans held a tense call that featured rank-and-file members\u2019 expressing concerns about their safety when they are in their districts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary as sh--,\u201d a senior House lawmaker said, describing how members of Congress feel after the Minnesota shootings.",
      "In the states: Even the limited protection available to the average member of Congress goes far beyond what is available to most state lawmakers, Adam Edelman reports.",
      "Outside of their state capital complexes, state legislators have little to no security protection. No state offers proactive security to members of its legislature, though law enforcement will typically step in if there are credible threats.",
      "And despite the renewed attention to the issue, lawmakers fear little will ultimately be done that can make a meaningful difference, given that in many states, such positions are effectively part-time jobs with small budgets.",
      "\u201cWe are constantly out there, vulnerable. Whether I\u2019m volunteering somewhere, knocking doors for someone, starting to run my own campaign, I\u2019m out there, vulnerable,\u201d said Arizona state Rep. Stephanie Simacek, a Democrat.",

      "New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic, so it seems logical that the winner of the party\u2019s mayoral primary next week will be a shoo-in for November. But it may not be that simple, as a confluence of factors could give rise to an unpredictable, multicandidate general election campaign.",
      "Start with the two leaders in the Democratic race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. Each carries significant political baggage.",
      "Cuomo, of course, resigned as governor in a sexual harassment scandal in 2021 and has faced sustained criticism of his Covid pandemic policies, especially relating to nursing homes. Even within his own party, Cuomo is a lightning rod, with a recent poll finding that over 40% of Democrats have unfavorable views of him. And Mamdani is a democratic socialist with a history of far-left pronouncements that are now being featured in attack ads from the Cuomo side.",
      "If either wins the Democratic primary, there figure to be plenty of unhappy customers within the party and \u2014 potentially \u2014 among general election voters who would be open to an alternative. And if one falls just short in the primary, either Cuomo and Mamdani could decide to turn around and take another shot in the general election. Each already has a ready-made vehicle to do so.",
      "Cuomo has created his own third party, which he is calling the Fight and Deliver Party. Officially, he did that to give himself a second spot on the November ballot if he is the Democratic nominee. Under New York\u2019s peculiar election laws, third parties can run major-party nominees as their own candidates. Cuomo\u2019s position is that he plans to be both the Democratic nominee and the Fight and Deliver nominee.",
      "But if Cuomo were to lose to Mamdani in the primary, there\u2019d be nothing to stop him from simply running as the Fight and Deliver candidate. In fact, his father, Mario, made that very move back in 1977, when he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Ed Koch but then ran as the Liberal Party candidate in the fall.",
      "Meanwhile, the Working Families Party, which is closely aligned with progressive Democrats, has already indicated that it won\u2019t back Cuomo even if he is the Democratic nominee. The WFP has also encouraged its backers to make Mamdani their top choice in the Democratic primary. That raises the possibility that Mamdani could run as the WFP\u2019s general election nominee even if he loses to Cuomo next week. For that matter, given its antipathy to Cuomo, the WFP might also seek out another high-profile candidate if Mamdani isn\u2019t interested.",
      "If Cuomo or Mamdani do opt to mount third-party bids in the fall, it could open the door to chaos, since other candidates already loom.",
      "The current mayor, Eric Adams, is bypassing the Democratic primary and already has created two vehicles for the general election, the \u201cEndAntiSemitism\u201d and \u201cSafe&Affordable\u201d parties. Adams, who faced federal corruption charges before President Donald Trump pardoned him, has his own political baggage but still retains some support, particularly from Black voters. That base, along with his incumbency, would make him a factor in a multicandidate general election.",
      "Republicans also have their own ballot line and are set to nominate Curtis Sliwa, who was their nominee against Adams in 2021. And a former federal prosecutor, Jim Walden, is running his own independent bid. He is positioning himself as a centrist and says he was motivated to run after Adams was indicted last year.",
      "Of course, it\u2019s possible that the Democratic primary result will be decisive enough that the loser stands down for the general election. That would all but ensure the winner a glide path to Gracie Mansion. It\u2019s also theoretically possible that another candidate besides Cuomo or Mamdani catches fire in the final week, claims the nomination and unites the party.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After weeks of stops and starts, Senate Republicans teamed up with a bloc of Democrats on Tuesday to pass a landmark cryptocurrency bill that would establish the first regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins.",
      "The vote on the GENIUS Act was 68-30, with 18 Democrats joining most Republicans in favor. Just two Republicans \u2014 Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 voted against it.",
      "The vote was the first time that the Senate has passed major legislation regulating digital assets.",
      "\"With this bill, the United States is one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., the author of the GENIUS Act, said in a floor speech. \"This bill will cement U.S. dollar dominance, it will protect customers, it will drive demand for U.S. treasuries.\"",
      "\"Today will be remembered as an inflection point for innovation in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "The GENIUS Act now heads to the Republican-led House, which has been working to pass its own bipartisan bill focused on creating a regulatory framework for digital assets.",
      "Washington continues to wrestle with how best to regulate the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry. Democrats have been divided over the issue, with some in the party pushing Congress to do more to rein in an industry they see as rife with conflicts of interests for President Donald Trump and his family.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee passed an earlier version of the GENIUS Act in April, with backing from five Democrats. But Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the Democrats \u2014 along with two Republicans \u2014 blocked the bill from advancing on the floor in May as they demanded stronger national security and anti-money laundering provisions.",
      "A group of bipartisan negotiators \u2014 Hagerty and Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md.; and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. \u2014 later struck a deal on changes to the bill that addressed key sticking points for Democrats.",
      "The changes called for consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, and they would extend ethics standards to special government employees.",
      "The bipartisan deal unlocked support from a broader group of Democrats, and the legislation advanced on the floor after it cleared the 60-vote threshold.",
      "\u201cI think because we worked so hard and so long with them that it got a few more of them to \u2018yes.\u2019 And so I think this is a real legislative victory,\u201d Lummis told NBC News before the vote. \u201cThey did get more of what they wanted. They should be voting yes, because they were extremely influential in shaping the legislation.\u201d",
      "But other Democrats were frustrated that nothing in the revised legislation would explicitly prevent Trump and his family from continuing their crypto ventures. New financial disclosure forms reveal that Trump made one of his largest fortunes last year, $57.3 million, on his family\u2019s cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.",
      "\"This is a bill that was written by the industry that will supercharge the profitability of Donald Trump's crypto corruption, while it undercuts consumer protection and weakens our national defense,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told NBC News.",
      "The legislation does include language that would \u201cprohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service.\u201d",
      "But Warren argued that the legislation isn't strong enough to prevent terrorists, drug traffickers and other criminals from using stablecoins for illicit purposes.",
      "The bill \"is in a better place, but it's not in a good enough place,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "From the moment they met in the villa on \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d Jeremiah Brown and Huda Mustafa were inseparable. Jeremiah, a 25-year-old model from Seattle, and Huda, a 24-year-old personal trainer from Raleigh, North Carolina, formed an instant connection that would dominate the early weeks of the reality dating show, airing through the summer on Peacock.",
      "Now, as Season 7 continues its third week, Huda and Jeremiah\u2019s relationship is becoming the talk of the internet. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on and what went down in the latest two episodes.",

      "\u2018Love Island USA\u2019 Season 7 Cast: Who's Still In the Villa?",
      "Who are Jeremiah and Huda?",
      "Jeremiah and Huda had been coupled up since Episode 1, when the initial group of women get to choose their partners after a game that involves a bit of kissing. Their connection is immediate. When former Islander Yulissa tries to kiss Jeremiah during the game, he deflects and opts for a kiss on the cheek instead \u2014 signaling quite early he has eyes for just Huda. By Episode 3, they are laughing about being the \u201cmom and dad\u201d of the villa.",
      "Huda actually is a mother, to a 4-year-old daughter. She chooses not to share this with the Islanders until she establishes trust with them. When she confides in Jeremiah at the end of Episode 3, he is shocked but says it doesn\u2019t change his feelings for her and promises not to tell.",
      "As re-couplings and new bombshells have come and gone, Huda and Jeremiah have stuck together, even through disagreements and doubts by other Islanders.",
      "That is, until Episode 12 ...",
      "What Happened in 'Love Island USA' Episode 12?",
      "Cracks began to show in Huda and Jeremiah\u2019s relationship during the June 15 episode. During a group challenge hosted by \u201cSummer House\u201d star Paige DeSorbo, Jeremiah kisses fellow Islander Olandria, which clearly bothers Huda.",
      "\u201cI was not expecting Jeremiah and Olandria to, like, actually kiss,\u201d Huda says in her confessional. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see that going on.\u201d",
      "When she confronts Jeremiah about it, he doubles down on his actions and responds coolly, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d",
      "The situation escalates when other Islanders begin side-eyeing Huda\u2019s reaction to the kiss. Nic asks Jeremiah if Huda\u2019s protective behavior is \u201cover the top,\u201d wondering if that level of reaction would be an issue for him in a \u201creal relationship.\u201d",
      "Jeremiah shrugs off the comments, responding simply, \u201cI mean I can\u2019t control what she do.\u201d",
      "But the real shock comes when host Ariana Madix sweeps through the villa to lead a re-coupling. In a \u201cLove Island USA\u201d first, America had voted on pairings for the new bombshells \u2014 Pepe, Iris and Jalen \u2014 and those left single would be at risk. In the most surprising twist, viewers choose to pair Jeremiah with Iris, effectively separating him from Huda.",
      "The re-coupling leaves Huda single and vulnerable. When the remaining coupled Islanders have to vote someone out of the villa, Huda receives two votes \u2014 from Nic and Ace, two of Jeremiah\u2019s close pals \u2014 but was ultimately saved when another Islander, Charlie, is eliminated instead.",
      "What Happened in Episode 13?",
      "The fallout from Episode 12 \u2014 from America choosing to separate Huda and Jeremiah, from Nic and Ace voting to eliminate Huda, and from Jeremiah\u2019s massive shrug at all of it \u2014 was immediate and explosive in Episode 13. Jeremiah doesn\u2019t speak to Huda for the rest of the evening after the re-coupling, later saying he was \u201cchecked out.\u201d",
      "Nic and Ace get in front of Jeremiah, though. Their conversation escalates quickly, with Nic suggesting Huda had been marking Jeremiah with hickeys so other women wouldn\u2019t engage.",
      "\u201cBoth of you are just closed off, it\u2019s been tunnel vision since day one,\u201d Nic says.",
      "Jeremiah defends their connection, saying, \u201cWe instantly liked each other and then we explored that further.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Ace replies. \u201cYou act like you\u2019re all about one person from day one. That\u2019s scamming. ... How are you so sure about someone 30 seconds in?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Huda is spinning about the viewers\u2019 choice to separate her and Jeremiah. Does America not like her, or is America seeing something about Jeremiah that she isn\u2019t? She appears to believe the latter: She rages to the girls that Jeremiah didn\u2019t check on her after the re-coupling and rages some more about it from the shower, which Jeremiah overhears.",
      "If those seeds of doubt weren\u2019t planted by the guys before, that shower moment might\u2019ve done it for Jeremiah. When Jeremiah and Iris are sent on a date, along with the other re-coupled Islanders, he says he is open to new connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to hit the reset button with you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAmerica put us together for one reason or another.\u201d",
      "When the couples return from their dates, Huda refuses to greet the returning Islanders, instead sitting alone by the pool being \u201cunbothered,\u201d as she put it. Jeremiah clocks it, muttering, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d",
      "The breaking point comes when Huda overhears Jeremiah debriefing the rest of the boys on his date with Iris. \u201cHuda\u2019s cooked, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Jeremiah says. He reveals that he\u2019d heard Huda in the shower the night before calling him a \u201cb----\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d",
      "\u201cTruthfully now in hindsight, I would have rather Huda have gone home, just because of the way she reacted,\u201d Jeremiah tells the guys.",
      "Huda emerges from behind a wall where she\u2019d been eavesdropping and confronts Jeremiah directly: \u201cBy all means, explore,\u201d she says, flipping him off.",
      "The episode ends with a private conversation, where Jeremiah apologizes to Huda for not being there when she was almost eliminated, but Huda isn\u2019t having it.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the reason why everything happened. You\u2019re the reason why I reacted the way I reacted,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI don\u2019t want s--- to do with you.\u201d",
      "What Happened in Episode 14?",
      "The June 17 episode picks up where Episode 13 ends, during that conversation with Huda and Jeremiah. Huda tells him that the Islanders and the viewers believe he has done \u201csubtle things\u201d that have shown his true colors, but Jeremiah replies that she has it flipped.",
      "\u201cWe have such different vibes and expectations, it seems,\u201d Jeremiah says in a confessional.",
      "Nevertheless, Jeremiah tries to make amends with Huda the next morning. During a private chat, he tells her that he\u2019d like to start over as friends. Huda\u2019s not interested in that though, and the chat devolves as Huda storms away, yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d",
      "The rest of the Islanders are watching all of this from various parts of the villa, and, as Nic says, they\u2019re drained.",
      "Fast forward to the end of the episode, when Ariana Madix shows up once again for a surprise re-coupling. This time, it involves a game where each of the women stand behind a locked door. Only the guy they want to couple with can open that door, though. Any guy who\u2019s met with a locked door and any girl who remains behind a door is left single and vulnerable.",
      "Jeremiah is the last guy to choose a door \u2014 and it\u2019s between Iris\u2019s and Huda\u2019s. He chooses Iris.",
      "That move now leaves Huda vulnerable once again, along with one other Islander, Jalen. And because \u201cLove Island\u201d never stops there, the rest of the Islanders are then tasked with voting one of the two singles out of the villa.",
      "While Huda ends up safe, receiving eight backers versus Jalen\u2019s four, the vote gave viewers a clear view of the Islanders\u2019 thoughts on this saga. Jeremiah is among the four who vote to keep Jalen and dump Huda. And another shocker? Ace backed Huda instead of Jalen \u2014 but maybe not for reasons Huda thought. When Huda reaches her hand out to thank Ace, he leans away. \u201cHell, no,\u201d he whispers.",
      "So the saga continues."

    "story": [
      "Barbara Walters was best known for her career as a pioneering journalist who spent many years with TODAY and ABC News. But much less well known is the tumultuous story of her private life, particularly with her lone child, Jacqueline, whom she adopted in 1968.",
      "In the new ABC News Studios documentary \u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything,\u201d which features archival footage of Walters, who died in 2022, she calls her daughter \u201ca blessing\u201d that came about after three miscarriages. She adds that having a daughter was \u201cthe best thing\u201d she ever did.",
      "But others took a different cue from the challenges Walters and Jackie faced over the years, especially when paired with a demanding, international career.",
      "\u201cShe had a charged, complex relationship with her daughter,\u201d says Oprah Winfrey in the doc, adding that witnessing how parenthood played out for Walters partially influenced her decision not to have children at all.",
      "In recent years, Jacqueline Guber, now in her late 50s, has kept her private life private, but there\u2019s much to know about her younger years and her relationship with her mother.",
      "Jacqueline was named for Barbara\u2019s sister",
      "Walters adopted Jacqueline with her second husband, theater producer Lee Guber. When Jacqueline was born, the couple kept her adoption a secret, making no press announcement, NBC News reported in 2002.",
      "\u201cIn part because I really didn\u2019t want the biological mother to know that Jackie had been adopted by us,\u201d Walters said. \u201cI just kept right on working.\u201d",
      "The adoption specifics were a bit unique, though. Walters told Winfrey in a 2014 interview, \u201cWe had dinner one night with a couple we rarely saw. The woman said that she had a little girl who was blonde and blue-eyed, and they wanted to adopt a boy. ... They didn\u2019t want the girl. And we said, \u2018We\u2019ll take the girl!\u2019\u201d",
      "She told Winfrey she named her after her older sister.",
      "In the documentary, Walters reflects on some of the challenges her sister faced.",
      "\u201cToday, they would talk about it as a disability,\u201d she says, \u201cand it may even be that my sister was autistic and we didn't know it.\u201d",
      "Walters also elaborated on the name significance in her 2014 retirement special, \u201cBarbara Walters: Her Story,\u201d according to People.",
      "\u201cI knew that my sister was never going to be married and have a child, and I wanted her to have part of the joy that I had.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline helped her mother accept \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019",
      "At the height of her fame, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Gilda Radner did an impression of Walters on the show known as \u201cBaba Wawa,\u201d honing in on how the journalist pronounced her \u201cr\u201d letters.",
      "Walters didn\u2019t like being made fun of until her daughter told her to \u201clighten up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hated the Gilda Radner \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019 until I walked into my daughter\u2019s room one night,\u201d Walters said during a 2009 interview with the Television Academy Foundation. \u201cShe was up watching it ... I said, \u2018What are you doing up?\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019m watching Baba Wawa.\u2019\u201d",
      "When Walters explained she didn\u2019t like the impression, Jacqueline said, \u201cLighten up.\u201d And in the interview, Walters said, \u201cI did.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline was a runaway as a teenager",
      "After her divorce in the 1970s, it was virtually impossible for Walters as an ambitious single woman to also be a full-time mother. As former TODAY co-anchor Katie Couric says in the new documentary, being a working mother was seen as \u201can oxymoron\u201d back then.",
      "Jacqueline was not left alone, journalist Cynthia McFadden, who was adopted herself, notes in the film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to say Jackie had a father, and Jackie had a governess,\u201d McFadden says.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how tough it was because she had a mother who was a celebrity,\u201d says Walters of her daughter in the doc.",
      "Walters explains Jacqueline struggled with schools and began taking pills. At 16, she ran away.",
      "\u201cI loved to run,\u201d Jacqueline told NBC in 2002. \u201cI thought running would solve all my problems.\u201d",
      "When Walters learned where her daughter was, she had a former Green Beret pick her up and sent her to an intervention program in Idaho for three years.",
      "\u201cEven though she, you know, probably kicked and screamed, she knew that things were getting so desperate, she had to go,\u201d Walters said in 2002. \u201cBut to send a child away is heartbreaking \u2026 I just knew that for this child, who was struggling enough to be her own person and not be Barbara Walter\u2019s daughter, to have this be headlines. I could have lived with it, OK. You know? But it would have been terrible for her.\u201d",
      "The program saved her life, Jacqueline said in 2002.",
      "She ran a wilderness camp for troubled teens",
      "After getting her diploma and completing the program, Jacqueline\u2019s father, Lee Guber, died. She was just 18, and moved to Oregon to find some anonymity, according to NBC News.",
      "She later moved to Maine where she met a licensed wilderness guide named Mark Danforth, and the two married.",

      "Pitt, who plays a veteran race car driver in the new film \u201cF1 The Movie,\u201d really did rev up the engines while behind the wheel for the part.",
      "\u201cOur first scene was on the grid during race weekend at Silverstone (home of British Grand Prix events), where F1 started, and we were on the grid with the drivers,\u201d he told TODAY\u2019s Savannah Guthrie at a June 16 New York City screening of the film in an interview that aired June 17. \u201cWe got one take, and we\u2019re moving on.

But the fact that these cars can brake, can stop and make a complete right turn. It feels like the car is going to flip, and it sticks. It is unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable what these drivers can do.\u201d",
      "Pitt may have been driving, but he said it wasn\u2019t necessarily his idea.",
      "\u201cJoseph Kosinski, our director, had this audacious idea that he\u2019s going to take real actors, put them in real cars, on real tracks, and embed us in the pinnacle of the sport, the F1 racing season,\u201d he said.",

I came out like a slow snail every time, and I\u2019d always stall it and hold up the whole grand prix,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, yeah, we trained for, like, four months over two years. And after you watch the movie, you\u2019re going to see us for real trying not to die!\u201d",

      "The singer's fans have been asking themselves just that since the art was released June 11, sparking conversation and controversy.",
      "Carpenter even replied to a person who questioned her personality and cover art choices.",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is the first follow-up to Carpenter's 2024 album \"Short 'n' Sweet\" that launched her to new heights of fame with songs like \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "What is the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "The cover art is immediately provocative. In the photo, Carpenter kneels on all fours wearing a tight black dress. Her hand rests on a man's leg. His hand, meanwhile, holds a chunk of her blond hair. Carpenter stares at the camera with an open-mouthed expression.",
      "On Instagram, Carpenter shared another image: A closeup of a dog wearing a collar with the words \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "She captioned the post, \"My new album, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend' \ud83d\udc3e is out on August 29, 2025. I can\u2019t wait for it to be yours x Pre-order now.\"",
      "What are fans saying about the art?",
      "The art has gotten mixed reactions from fans, as evidenced by the comments on the original post and multiple Reddit threads.",
      "In the comments of Carpenter's post, people used words like \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the imagery, saying it was \"not a very empowering image for women.\" Another told her to \"please please please stand UP.\"",
      "Others tried to read into the image's connection to the album's title and found a deeper meaning.",
      "\"Man\u2019s best friend double meaning for dogs and female dogs are b---hes so it\u2019s a play on the ideology of men being so dependent on women,\" one commenter said. \"Her cover shows her being in a submissive role but in reality she\u2019s the one who has actual control.\"",
      "Commenters debated back-and-forth. One said they were getting \"secondhand embarrassment\" by looking at the picture. Another responded, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to embarrass women but rather to show how women are regarded by certain men.\"",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Carpenter's reps for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "What is Sabrina Carpenter trying to say? A PR expert breaks it down",
      "Beth Booker, public perception expert and creator of \"The Uncensored Publicist,\" says the artwork should be situated within Carpenter's own brand and the way female pop stars are often marketed.",
      "The image is a familiar one at first: A \u201cfemale pop star posed and packaged perfectly for the male gaze,\" Booker says, comparing it to Britney Spears in the early 2000s or Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" era.",
      "However, Booker sees this as Carpenter \"flipping the script\" on a familiar format. Since humor is such a \"huge part of her brand,\" she says this should be interpreted with a wink.",
      "\"The cover is hypersexualized, yes, but intentionally exaggerated to feel almost absurd,\" she says. \"She\u2019s sexy, but she\u2019s also funny, self-aware, and in complete control of how she\u2019s being seen.\"",
      "Booker says that Carpenter's submissive posture in the photo is not an indication she's like that in real life.",
      "\"She\u2019s not performing desire for someone else\u2019s approval, she\u2019s expressing it for herself and her audience. The title, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend,' directly nods to how women have been labeled 'b-----s' for decades and she\u2019s essentially saying: fine, I\u2019ll take the word, flip it, and turn it into part of my brand,\" Booker says.",
      "Fans are debating Carpenter's intentions, which Booker says may have been Carpenter's intention.",
      "\"That confusion is the point. Great pop culture lives in that gray area where people aren\u2019t quite sure how they\u2019re supposed to feel. Is it satire? Is it sexy? The answer is yes. She knows exactly how this image would land and she\u2019s allowing people to sit in that tension because that\u2019s what keeps the conversation going. She\u2019s not being provocative accidentally, she\u2019s doing it on her own terms,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some people, even some of her own fans, are uncomfortable with it actually reinforces the point. Brand evolution doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable in real time, and that\u2019s part of what makes this moment important for her career.\u201d",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is Carpenter's seventh studio album and it'll follow the release of \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her sixth studio album, which won pop album of the year at the 2025 Grammys.",
      "What did Sabrina Carpenter say about the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "Days after Carpenter unveiled the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend,\" her upcoming album, she replied to someone questioning the photo.",
      "A X user commented, \u201cDoes she have a personality outside of sex?\u201d reposting the cover art.",

      "Close and Porter's casting in the Francis Lawrence-directed prequel was officially announced during Lionsgate's presentation at the CineEurope film expo, Deadline reported.",
      "Producer Nina Jacobson said of eight-time Oscar nominee Close, \"Glenn Close is a dream Drusilla. She brings so much of her intellect and imagination to each role, creating characters who are unforgettable and iconic. I think Glenn and Francis will have a ball bringing Drusilla from the page to the screen.\"",
      "She added of three-time Tony winner Porter, \"Billy is one of those rare performers who can dazzle and devastate in equal measure on stage and screen. He made an indelible impression on me when we worked together on 'Pose,' both as an actor and a human being.\"",
      "Jacobson went on to say that casting the movie has felt like \"winning the lottery\" every time one of her \"idols\" agrees to accept a part. \"To be able to announce Glenn Close and Billy Porter together is an embarrassment of riches that we can all celebrate,\" she said.",

      "The plot of \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" follows 16-year-old Haymitch Abernathy \u2014 played as an adult by Woody Harrelson in the original movie trilogy \u2014 as he navigates being chosen as a District 12 tribute to fight to the death in the 50th annual Hunger Games.",
      "The novel illustrates how Haymitch wins the Hunger Games while also becoming a rebel against the political system that created them.",
      "Shortly after \u201cSunrise on the Reaping\u201d was announced in June 2024, Lionsgate confirmed that a film adaptation of the book would premiere in theaters in November 2026."

      "Rebel Wilson's daughter, Royce, has made a significant mark on the actor's health.",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com in studio on June 16, Wilson, 45, credited 2-year-old Royce with allowing her and her wife, Ramona Agruma, to maintain healthy eating habits.",
      "\u201cI go on and off the rails with healthy eating and stuff. But what\u2019s really good is that with her, we\u2019re so conscious, my wife and I, about feeding her healthy, nutritious meals,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cWhich makes me remind myself again about being healthy.\u201d",
      "Wilson explains that while she herself would \u201coften eat a lot of junk food,\u201d parents would \u201cnever deliberately feed your child rubbish.\u201d And avoiding feeding her child \"rubbish\" is a good way to keep her own health goals on track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nice reminder for yourself to try to be like, \u2018Well, I\u2019d never give that to my daughter for dinner,\u2019 right? Just cookies for dinner or something like that \u2014 so why would I be doing that for myself?\u201d she says.",
      "In another lesson from her daughter, Wilson says Royce has taught her \u201chow to be present,\u201d even though her mind is normally racing around work, projects and everyday life.",
      "\u201cI was sitting down with her and I was playing with this kind of sand \u2014 it\u2019s like magnetic sand or something. I mean, just sitting there, just playing and talking to each other and just being present and not worrying about anything else,\u201d she recalls.",
      "As she enjoys \u201cthe simple pleasures of just being present with your child,\u201d Wilson says being a mom and newly married has shifted her priorities.",
      "\u201cIt just really changed my life. I mean, I don\u2019t have much of a social life,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cMy spare time goes to my wife and daughter, and so I\u2019m not gallivanting around like I used to be as a single lady, but it\u2019s just so fun.\u201d",
      "Wilson continued, \u201cI feel so settled and nice and like everything\u2019s going great. And I think just, women in their 40s anyway, you just find a nice groove and a nice place of comfortability where you are, which is great.\u201d",
      "The \u201cBride Hard\u201d star married Agruma in a ceremony in September 2024 in Sardinia, Italy. Wilson\u2019s daughter, Royce, was born via surrogate on Nov. 7, 2022."

      "Curtis, who's been open about her love for her new friend Hargitay, was equally as supportive of Hargitay's personal project.",

      "\u201cBut what I find so amazing is that this story has not gone out there, and it was mine to tell,\u201d she said.",
      "One constant in the film is Mansfield\u2019s love of music. The 1950s Hollywood starlet played piano and the violin, including in some of her television appearances, like on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d",
      "At one point in the archival footage, Mansfield says she one day hopes to play at Carnegie Hall.

That\u2019s what I was after.\u201d",
      "Hargitay said she \u201cwent into the movie truly not liking the sound of my mother\u2019s voice.\u201d Mansfield was known for her breathy, higher-pitched voice in her on-camera appearances.",
      "\u201cEven in the beginning, listening to it, I was like, cringe,\u201d Hargitay explained. \u201cAnd then as the movie went on, and I got to hear her real voice. And tonight, as I was getting ready, I was playing her music and listening to songs that I had heard before. And everything has been reframed.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy Mom Jayne\u201d will air June 27 on HBO at 8 p.m. ET and stream on HBO Max."

      "It's the third time we've spoken over the last two years and the first time we've met in person. As a lifelong fan of the CBS daytime drama, I'm excited to finally come face to face with the man who has played business tycoon Victor Newman for the last 45 years.",
      "On \"Y&R,\" Braeden's character is known for his ardent family values and ruthless business moves: a rare combination that sometimes puts him in compromising positions.",
      "In person, Braeden certainly has a commanding presence at just over 6 feet tall, but he also possesses a warm, playful nature that has won the hearts of countless fans and colleagues alike.",
      "Case in point? Braeden greets me at the door of his dressing room by pretending to peek outside the door and hide for a second. Then he gives me a big hug.",
      "After talking about my flight to California, Braeden and I chat for a few moments before diving into the matter at hand: a conversation about his 45th anniversary on \"Y&R.\"",
      "When I ask how he celebrated such a colossal milestone back in February, the 84-year-old has a simple response.",
      "\"I personally don\u2019t celebrate much. You just sit back and you allow yourself to say, 'Whoa, that\u2019s a long time.' I'm not someone who rests on laurels. I don\u2019t do that,\" he explains. \"I\u2019m always future oriented. I'm always (asking), 'What's next? Let's go.'\"",
      "It's a mentality that has served Braeden well throughout his decades-long career in Hollywood and one that helped him cope with the loss of his house amid the California wildfires earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t allow myself to think about that too much because I have known people who then get dragged down by it,\" he says.",
      "Braeden and his wife of nearly 60 years, Dale Russell Gudegast, have found a \"semi-permanent place\" to live as they sort out plans to rebuild their home.",
      "For Braeden, having something to look forward to helps keep him motivated.",
      "\"The solution lies in action, in doing,\" he says.",
      "Braeden, who was born Hans J\u00f6rg Gudegast and grew up in Germany, is certainly a doer. At the age of 18, he moved from Germany to the U.S. and worked a variety of jobs before stumbling into the entertainment industry.",
      "Now, his acting credits run the gamut of film, theater and TV, including roles in \"Titanic,\" \"The Rat Patrol,\" \"Colossus: The Forbin Project\" and countless others.",
      "While building his career, Braeden once visited the set of a soap opera but didn't give the medium much thought again until he later got the opportunity to take on the role of Victor Newman in 1980.",
      "Ironically, the actor was never supposed to stay at \u201cY&R\u201d very long. But as he settled into the temporary role, fans grew to love Victor, and Braeden was offered a long-term contract.",
      "The only problem? Braeden wasn't sold on the character. So he spoke to his wife, who encouraged him to look at the role as a challenge. Then, he sat down with Bill Bell, the co-creator of \"Y&R.\"",
      "\"I said, 'Bill, I\u2019m tired of playing only bad guys. I\u2019ve done that for so many years, on nighttime television, films.' I said, 'Can we attribute a background to this character that explains why he is who he is?' Because we all are formed by it. And he came up with the storyline where I tell Nikki (Newman) that I grew up in an orphanage. I then knew I would stay,\" he recalls.",
      "Braeden's character has been at the center of a plethora of captivating storylines over the years, but he's particularly fond of one that featured Dorothy McGuire and George Kennedy playing his on-screen mother and father.",
      "\"All of that creates the bedrock for what Victor Newman became, and that was the brilliance of Bill Bell, who came up with that storyline,\" Braeden says. \"Those are by far, hands down, the most seminal scenes I\u2019ve done in the show explaining who Victor Newman is.\"",
      "Victor has had many romantic interests over the course of 45 years, but none compare to his epic love story with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).",
      "\"The reason Mel and I have been doing it so long is because she gets me. Mel knows how to deal with me. ... And I with her,\" he says while complimenting his \"clever\" and talented co-star.",
      "As the head of Newman Enterprises, Victor is known as a master manipulator in the world of business. But in real life, Braeden says he doesn't possess the same penchant for corporate subterfuge.",
      "\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t do anything that Victor does. I\u2019m not a business guy,\u201d he says, noting that he does have a few things in common with his character.",
      "For instance, Victor never shies away from a fight, and Braeden shares the same signature tenacity.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to confrontation, I don\u2019t back down. I don\u2019t give a f--- who it is. I don\u2019t back down. And that has been the case with me since I was a young boy,\u201d he says.",
      "Victor is known for meddling in his family\u2019s affairs, especially their romantic escapades. But Braeden takes a more even-keeled approach.",
      "\"I love my family and would never dictate to my family,\" he says.",
      "Speaking of family, Braeden lights up when I bring up his son, Christian Gudegast, whom he refers to as his \u201cgreatest accomplishment\u201d in his book, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Damned.\u201d",
      "In a way, Gudegast has followed in his father's footsteps, pursuing a career as a writer and director.",
      "\"I always sort of wanted him to become an actor. And only about half a year ago, he told me why he didn\u2019t want it. Because he saw me at certain times in my life very upset about not getting this or that role,\u201d he explains.",
      "Braeden sent his son to acting school to give him a solid foundation as a director and has supported his dreams ever since.",
      "Braeden's passion for his craft is evident as he recounts his iconic career. Although he had many notable acting credits to his name before joining the cast of \"Y&R,\" he tells me that the soap opera taught him something invaluable about the significance of an actor's work.",
      "\u201cOne of the most profound meanings is to entertain people. I learned that here in this medium and I\u2019m very grateful,\" he says. \"I\u2019m very grateful to fans for that reason because they taught me what this is about \u2014 entertainment,\" he says.",
      "While talking about the volume of work he and his colleagues produce on a weekly basis, the soap opera veteran's pride is evident.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s the toughest medium there is in Hollywood. I\u2019ve done it all,\" he says. \"For writers, this is the hardest job in all of Hollywood, writing for a soap. As an actor, it is equally much the hardest job there is.\"",
      "Braeden goes on to describe just how much work goes into filming a soap opera.",
      "\"In film, we do two or three pages a day,\" he explains.",
      "On the opposite end of the spectrum, Braeden says soap operas typically shoot 100 pages of dialogue a day. As a main star of the show, he's certainly in demand and has a record of shooting 62 pages of dialogue in one day.",
      "I get to witness Braeden in action filming scenes for an upcoming episode, and it's easy to see why he's so respected by his colleagues.",
      "The industry veteran handles his lines with ease and also imbues a sense of fun into his work, chatting animatedly with his co-stars and the crew.",
      "While reading Braeden's autobiography, I was intrigued by a passage where he discusses a quote from playwright and screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who defined happiness as \"insensitivity.\"",
      "After losing his father at the age of 12 and navigating poverty at a young age, I'm curious to know if Braeden's worldview was shaped by these formative experiences and how he himself defines happiness.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in and of itself. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s b-------.  (Happiness is) in the doing, and it\u2019s in the few moments after the doing that you feel, \u2018Well, I accomplished something. Great.\u2019 That\u2019s it. A few minutes afterwards, then you\u2019ve got to plan another thing to do. There\u2019s no permanent happiness state,\u201d he explains.",
      "The answer is consistent with the way Braeden has progressed in his career: constantly on the move, consistently challenging himself.",
      "The actor shows no signs of slowing down, and I can't help but selfishly wonder if he will ever leave \"Y&R\" to enjoy a proper retirement. Luckily for me and countless other fans, he has no plans of stepping away from his career anytime soon.",
      "\u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing. I love doing it. I don\u2019t know why, but I do,\u201d he says."

      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre\u2019s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What\u2019s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "The Mona Lisa\u2019s daily mob",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff planned to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "A museum in limbo",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks."

      "Pochettino said he wanted to create competition for Turner, who didn't get into a Crystal Palace match after March 1. The coach said Turner told him he was disappointed with the decision but understood it and would compete to get playing time."

At least 224 people in Iran have been killed since Israel\u2019s initial attack Friday, Iranian state media reported, while 24 people have been killed by Iran\u2019s retaliatory strikes against Israel.",
      "Israel says its military campaign is aimed at dismantling Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, citing the \u201cexistential threat\u201d it would face if Iran were to develop an atomic bomb."

      "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 Britain\u2019s real-life spies have finally caught up with James Bond. MI6 has appointed its first female chief.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \u201cI am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\u201d",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2014 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2014 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller from 2002 to 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women\u2019s rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-went-opposing-israels-strikes-iran-reluctant-support-rcna213091",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump had opposed Israeli action against Iran, but came to believe Israel had reason to act and that the U.S. would have to lend some support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."
