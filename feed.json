      "Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who in emulation of his father lived for years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who was inspired by his father to spend years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, died Tuesday at age 97.",
      "Hemingway, the second of the author's three sons, died at his home in Bozeman, Montana, his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, confirmed in a statement.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",
      "As an executor of his father's estate, Patrick Hemingway approved reissues of such classics as \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"A Moveable Feast,\" featuring revised texts and additional commentary from the author\u2019s son and others. The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure. Patrick's half-niece, the actor and model Margaux Hemingway, died from an overdose of phenobarbital in 1996. (Jack Hemingway, the eldest son, died in 2000).",
      "Inheriting his father\u2019s round face and stocky build, Patrick Hemingway was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Ernest Hemingway and the second of his four wives, Pauline Pfeiffer. Because the author rarely stayed in one place for an extended time, the Hemingways lived everywhere from Cuba and Spain to Wyoming and Key West, Florida during Patrick\u2019s childhood (Ernest and Pauline divorced in 1940). Patrick Hemingway would recall his father\u2019s various \u201ctrophy mounts\u201d of animals hunted down on safari and how they were \u201ctastefully distributed throughout every room\u201d of their Key West house, including a wildebeest that hung in the bedroom of Patrick and Gregory.",

      "Kim Novak has made an emotional return to the spotlight at 92",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kim Novak was worried she\u2019d made a mistake. The 92-year-old star of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo\u201d had made the long trek from Oregon to Venice, Italy, for the film festival. There she\u2019d be receiving a lifetime achievement award and supporting the world premiere of a documentary about her life and career, \u201cKim Novak\u2019s Vertigo.\u201d",
      "But on that first day, she wasn\u2019t feeling strong or up to the task.",
      "\u201cI thought I could handle it, then I thought, no I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not physically strong enough,\u201d Novak told The Associated Press this week. \u201cThen I heard my mother\u2019s voice from heaven and she said \u2018just have fun and enjoy it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Novak listened to that voice and was glad she did. Being bipolar, she said, she\u2019s used to going through a lot of emotions. But the experience in Venice has been a dream.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very first events that I\u2019ve really had fun, really fun,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier in the week, she was presented with a Golden Lion lifetime achievement award. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, who presented the honor, listed off many of her most famous credits, including \u201cVertigo,\u201d Otto Preminger\u2019s \u201cThe Man with the Golden Arm,\u201d Joshua Logan\u2019s \u201cPicnic,\u201d \u201cPal Joey\u201d and \u201cBell, Book and Candle.\u201d Novak was the top box-office star in the world from 1958 through 1960 and became the first woman to start her own production company before leaving Hollywood behind in 1966 to live a private life devoted to painting.",
      "\u201cMost impressive is the fact that she was capable of projecting frailty, power, mystery. To appear, endearing, dynamic, mythical and phenomenal,\u201d del Toro said. \u201cAnd with all those wonderful arresting performances, she always carried a little bit of warmth, a little bit of heartbreak and a little bit of mystery.\u201d",
      "Novak reflects on her extraordinary life in Alexandre O. Philippe\u2019s documentary, which premiered out of competition in Venice. She said it was fate that Philippe came into her life and wanted to make the film.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I wanted to talk about my life, because I\u2019m at the end of my life,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt was meant to be. And I can\u2019t think of anyone it was better to do it with.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my phone had voice memos,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy for me to open up and discuss the intimate things, but it was wonderful because it was like I was talking to myself. Once you open the door, it all comes flooding out.\u201d",
      "Coming to the festival was brave of Novak, Philippe said. Just over a decade ago, Novak stepped back in the public eye to present at the 2014 Oscars, which led many online, including Donald Trump, to insult her appearance.",
      "\u201cThe easy thing would have been to stay in Oregon and keep painting,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point in her life the hard thing is to come back into the spotlight and show herself again. But she did the hard thing. And she came on stage, not as an icon, not as a movie star, but she came on stage and said \u2018I am you and you are me.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time at the end of your life to put the puzzle pieces together and make them fit,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible experience to see them all falling in place and somehow coming to this festival is like putting some of the other pieces that you couldn\u2019t put together that now come together and make a whole beautiful, beautiful, picture.\u201d",
      "Even the \u201cVertigo\u201d suit she once hated so much as taken on a different light. In the film, she gets to see the costume for the first time since making the film. The fabric that she remembered having been so rough and hard had softened with time, which seemed like an apt metaphor.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to see it when you have all this life behind you, it makes you think that what you thought was right when you were young is not necessarily so. It could be wrong, and vice versa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all this you gain over time. And so becoming old is a beautiful thing, you know? And this festival, being able to experience it through Hollywood eyes, it\u2019s just incredible. I loved it, I love it. I\u2019m experiencing great joy.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat is sweeter in the world than appreciation,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel appreciated and you can\u2019t know how much that means.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s also looking forward to getting home and painting again. Every night at the festival she\u2019s found herself sketching and dreaming up ideas for more works.",
      "\u201cMy legacy is my art,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have my old movies, but you also have my new perspective on life. I do it all in my work and I want that to be my legacy. I want to get in a whole lot more paintings before I pass. So I can\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lee Corso is set to retire from ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on Saturday",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It is rare for a sports broadcasting figure to retire on his own terms or to be able to accept the tributes or adulation of colleagues and fans.",
      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",
      "GameDay\u2019s 26th appearance in Columbus also marks a full-circle moment for Corso. It was outside Ohio Stadium on Oct. 5, 1996, where Corso\u2019s popular headgear prediction segment began.",
      "Corso donned Brutus Buckeye\u2019s head before Ohio State faced Penn State, and the rest is history.",
      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the schedule, the obvious place was to try to go to Tallahassee, where he played (at Florida State), but this game is so big. The fact that it\u2019s a noon game. It became a no-brainer to have it here,\u201d Herbstreit said. \u201cIt is very kind of storybook. The fact that we started with this and and end it here in Columbus.\u201d",
      "Corso has a 66.5% winning rate on his headgear predictions (286-144), which is much better than his 73-85-6 mark in 15 years as a coach at Louisville, Indiana, and Northern Illinois.",
      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",
      "Tom Rinaldi and Chris Fallica \u2014 former GameDay crew members now with Fox Sports \u2014 are also expected to give their thoughts on Corso\u2019s retirement.",

      "The show took place at ESPN\u2019s studios in Bristol, Connecticut, until it went on the road for the first time in 1993, before Notre Dame hosted Florida State in a No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup. The show has been on the road regularly since 1995.",

      "Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said the beauty of Corso and \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d is that they allow fans to experience the flavor of being at a game at Texas or Alabama on television.",
      "\u201cCoach Corso was able to bring the aspect of a coach and a very analytical approach to the games being played, but then the entertainment and doing the headgear at the end of every show,\u201d Sarkesian said. \u201cI know that was something we all used to look forward to. What was he going to do? Like that was going to determine who would win the game or not, but that was the beauty of the show, getting people excited about every Saturday for college football.\u201d",
      "GameDay producer Jim Gaiero thinks Corso may still have a surprise or two for Saturday. No one would be surprised if he led on that he was picking with Ohio State and ended up going with Texas.",
      "But even though Corso will no longer be a part of Saturday mornings for college football fans, his impact will continue to be felt.",
      "His ability to bring entertainment to a preview show helped get away from seriousness. You can be outrageous and still do your job, but you can still have fun,\u201d Gaiero said. \u201cI think other shows have tried to do that, even political shows.\u201d",

      "A bill that would let Texas residents sue out-of-state abortion pill providers for up to $100,000 has been passed by lawmakers and sent to the governor",
      "Texas lawmakers on Wednesday approved letting private citizens sue abortion pill manufacturers, doctors and anyone who mails the medication, setting the state up to be the first to try to crack down on the most common abortion method.",
      "The law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.",
      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",
      "Under the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.",
      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",

      "The idea of using citizens rather than government officials to enforce abortion bans is not new in Texas. It was at the heart of 2021 law that curtailed abortion there months before the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for other state bans to take effect.",
      "In the earlier law, citizens could collect $10,000 for bringing a successful lawsuit against a provider or anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion. But that measure didn\u2019t explicitly seek to go after out-of-state providers.",

      "The nonprofit APOPO has worked in Morogoro, Tanzania, for more than two decades to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions",
      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",
      "\u201cOur choice was to go for that last patient out there \u2014 to go for the social impact,\u201d said Cox.",

      "Residents of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region are facing devastating conditions as evacuations continue amid ongoing conflict",
      "KOSTIANTYNIVKA, Ukraine -- For many residents of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, evacuation begins with one defining blast \u2014 the explosion that makes it impossible to stay. For 69-year-old Tetiana Zaichikova, it came when a strike reduced her home to rubble.",
      "The region has been the epicenter of heavy fighting for years and evacuations there have continued as long as Russia\u2019s invasion \u2014 more than three years. Town after town in the region, larger than Slovenia or roughly the size of Massachusetts, is emptying amid the fighting as Russian forces now control around 70% of the area.",
      "Some are staying in shattered cities, clinging to the hope that the war will end any day \u2014 a hope fueled by ongoing peace efforts, largely led by U.S. President Donald Trump, that so far yielded no breakthroughs. They hold on until it becomes too dangerous even for the military and police to drive into the city.",
      "\u201cWe kept hoping. We waited for every round of negotiations. We thought somehow they would reach an agreement in our favor, and we could stay in our homes,\u201d said Zaichikova, who still bears bruises and hematomas across her face.",
      "If Zaichikova had taken even one step into the kitchen that night, she is convinced she would not have survived.",
      "In Kostiantynivka \u2014 a city that once had a population of approximately 67,000 \u2014 conditions in recent months have become apocalyptic: There is no reliable electricity, water or gas, and nightly barrages grow heavier with each passing hour. Russian forces fire all types of weapons while Ukrainian troops answer back, and the former industrial hub has become a proving ground crowded with drones overhead.",
      "Zaichikova knew the city was barely livable, but she clung to the hope she would not lose the place where she had lived all her life and taught music at a kindergarten.",
      "On the night of Aug. 28, after months of rarely leaving her home, she wanted only to make tea before bed. She switched on a night lamp and walked toward the kitchen. As she reached for the light switch, the blast hit.",
      "A wooden beam and shelves collapsed on her. When she came to, the rubble rose as high as she stood. The entrance to her building was blocked.",
      "Emergency services no longer operated in the city, too dangerous even for soldiers. \u201cIf we had been burning, we would have just burned,\u201d she said.",
      "Her neighbor swung a sledgehammer through the night until midday, finally breaking a hole for her to crawl through. Outside, she saw what she believed was the crater of a glide bomb.",
      "A few days later, she left the city.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave until the last moment, but that was the last straw. When I was driven through the city, I saw what it had become. It was black and destroyed,\u201d she said.",
      "Police Officer Yevhen Mosiichuk has driven into Kostiantynivka almost every day for the past year to evacuate people. He has watched the situation deteriorate.",
      "The city now sits on Ukraine\u2019s shrinking patch of territory, wedged just west of Russian-held Bakhmut and nearly encircled from three sides by Moscow\u2019s forces.",
      "\u201cThe difficulty of evacuations is that the city is under constant attack,\u201d he said, listing not only drones but artillery, rockets and glide bombs.",

      "Wearing a helmet and body armor, Mosiichuk approached the apartment building of those who had requested evacuation. Explosions rumbled at varying distances. He and his colleague worked quickly, knowing every minute in the city was life-threatening.",
      "The entrance was littered with shattered glass, and every floor had broken windows. Faded notices on the walls advertised electricians and plumbers who would never come.",

Many of their neighbors and friends had fled in the first months of the invasion; some later returned and left again.

      "Sudan plunged into chaos when simmering tensions between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces exploded into street fighting in April 2023 in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere in the country.

      "Before the presentation of the giant gold-framed portrait Wednesday in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata, the painting had not been seen publicly in 80 years.",
      "The first-ever color photo of the portrait surfaced last month in an online real estate listing unwittingly posted by one of the daughters of Friedrich Kadgien, the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing the painting from one of Europe\u2019s most prominent prewar art dealers and collectors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\u201d federal prosecutor Daniel Adler said in a press conference to display the full-length portrait of Countess Colleoni, her hair ink-black and dress embroidered with pastel flowers.",

      "News of the find thrilled historians the world over and eventually reached the heirs of the painting\u2019s original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. He died in a shipwreck after fleeing Amsterdam ahead of advancing German troops in May 1940.",

      "There was no shortage of pageantry at Wednesday\u2019s military parade in Beijing, but beyond the spectacle, it also provided the first good look at China\u2019s latest military hardware",
      "BANGKOK -- Soldiers in pristine and pressed uniforms marched in lockstep, their boots clacking a steady cadence on the pavement and their eyes following leader Xi Jinping as he drove by in review. Helicopters flew overhead, forming the numbers 8 and 0 in honor of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.",
      "There was no shortage of pageantry at Wednesday's military parade in Beijing, but beyond the spectacle, it also provided the first good look at China's latest military hardware. New missiles, drones and other high-tech equipment have been added to its arsenal as part of a massive modernization program with the goal, according to the official parade announcers, of producing a force \u201cwith both nuclear and conventional capabilities able to deter wars in all battle spaces.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the highlights:",
      "China's nuclear arsenal still lags far behind that of the United States and Russia, but it has been rapidly expanding. In its annual report to Congress on China, the U.S. Department of Defense estimated that Beijing now has more than 600 warheads and will have more than 1,000 by 2030.",
      "The parade featured many of the missiles capable of delivering those warheads, from air, sea and land. China's official Xinhua News Agency said it was the first time the military's \u201ctriad of strategic nuclear forces was presented in a concentrated fashion,\u201d calling it \u201cChina's strategic trump card for safeguarding national sovereignty and defending national dignity.\u201d",
      "The display of the three systems together is noteworthy, said Meia Nouwens, senior fellow for Chinese security and defense policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "\u201cAll of that, of course, goes back to this key point about deterrence and the messaging that the PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) and Xi Jinping are seeking to send to the U.S. and other partners and allies in the region and further afield,\" she said.",
      "Among the nuclear-capable missiles seen was the DF-61, a new intercontinental ballistic missile which can be fired from a mobile launching platform. Details on its capabilities are scant, but its predecessor has a range of more than 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) and can carry multiple warheads. It also debuted the newest variant of the silo-based DF-5, the DF-5C, whose range has been estimated at 20,000 kilometers.",
      "Also featured were the JL-1 air-launched long-range missile and the JL-3 sea-launched missile, both of which are also nuclear-capable.",
      "The parade saw the debut of other new missiles, including several designed to attack ships. These are likely of particular interest to the U.S., whose naval power is a key component of its Asia-Pacific defense strategy.",
      "China claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its own, and Xi has not ruled out taking the island by force. In the event of a Chinese invasion, if the U.S. were to come to Taiwan's aid, China would need to hold off the U.S. Navy long enough to consolidate control of the island.",

      "MADRID -- The extremely hot, dry and windy conditions, which fueled one of the IberianPeninsula's most destructive wildfire seasons in recorded history, were 40 times more likely due to climate change, according to a study released Thursday.",
      "The analysis by World Weather Attribution, or WWA, said the weather conditions were about 30% more intense compared to the preindustrial era, when heavy reliance on fossil fuels began.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula broke out in July and August. They spread rapidly thanks to temperatures that pushed above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds.",

This time, the researchers looked at weather observations without using climate models. But the results were consistent with existing research on wildfires in the region, the researchers said, and another study WWA recently published on this year's fires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, which found that climate change made fire-prone weather conditions there 10 times more likely.",
      "\u201cWhile fires are a characteristic of the Mediterranean climate, human-caused climate change increases the recurrence and severity of conditions favorable for intense fires, making fire control efforts much more challenging,\u201d Masson-Delmotte said.",
      "The researchers mentioned other factors that have contributed to the severity of the wildfires, including large population shifts that have taken place over decades in Spain and Portugal from the countryside to cities. The study said this has resulted in large areas of neglected overgrown farms and forests, which further fuel the fires.",
      "Removing vegetation using machinery, encouraging grazing by sheep, horses and goats and using other methods, such as controlled burns, would reduce the risk during wildfire seasons, researchers said.",

      "The eastern Mediterranean and Middle East are in the grips of one of their worst droughts in decades, which is drying rivers and lakes, shriveling crops and even leading to water cutoffs in major cities",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- The worst drought in decades is gripping much of the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, drying out rivers and lakes, shriveling crops and leading to dayslong tap water cutoffs in major cities.",
      "The situation is particularly dire in Syria, where experts say rainfall has been declining for decades and where the fledgling government is trying to stitch the country back together following a 14-year civil war that left millions impoverished and reliant on foreign aid.",
      "Small-farmer Mansour Mahmoud al-Khatib said that during the war, he couldn't reach his fields in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab some days because militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah militia allied with then-President Bashar Assad would block the roads. That problem vanished when Hezbollah withdrew after Assad fell in a December rebel offensive, but the drought has devastated his farm, drying up the wells that irrigate it.",
      "\u201cThe land is missing the water,\u201d al-Khatib told The Associated Press recently as he watched workers feed the wheat he did manage to harvest into a threshing machine. \u201cThis season is weak \u2014 you could call it half a season. Some years are better and some years are worse, but this year is harsh.\u201d",
      "In a good year, his land could produce as much as 800 to 900 kilograms (1,764 to 1,984 pounds) of wheat per dunam, an area equal to 0.1 hectares and 0.25 acres. This year, it yielded about a quarter that much, he said. He hired only six or seven workers this harvest season instead of last year\u2019s 15.",
      "Because the drought followed a prolonged war, farmers who were already financially stretched have had little ability to cope with its effects, said Jalal Al Hamoud, national food security officer for the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization in Syria.",
      "Before the uprising-turned-civil war that began in 2011, Syrian farmers produced an average of 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons of wheat per year, which was enough to meet the country\u2019s domestic needs, according to Saeed Ibrahim, director of agricultural planning and economics in Syria\u2019s Agriculture Ministry.",
      "That annual yield dropped to 2.2 million to 2.6 million tons during the war, and in recent years, the government has had to import 60% to 70% of its wheat to feed its roughly 23 million people. This year's harvest is expected to yield only 1 million tons, forcing the country to spend even more of its strained resources on imports.",
      "Mudar Dayoub, a spokesperson for Syria's Ministry of Internal Trade and Consumer Protection, said this year\u2019s wheat crop will only last for two or three months and that the government is \"currently relying on signing contracts to import wheat from abroad\u201d and on donations, including from neighboring Iraq.",
      "But in a country where the World Food Program estimates that half the population is food-insecure, Ibrahim warned that \u201ctotal reliance on imports and aid threatens food security\u201d and is \u201cunsustainable.\u201d",
      "The drought isn't the only major issue facing Syria, where postwar reconstruction is projected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Since Assad fled, the country has been rattled by outbreaks of sectarian violence, and there's growing doubt about whether the new authorities will be able to hold it together. Without jobs or stability, millions of refugees who fled during the war are unlikely to come home.",
      "A dam on the Litani River in neighboring Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley forms Lake Qaraoun, a reservoir that spans about 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles).",
      "Over the years, climate change has led to a gradual decline in the water flowing into the reservoir, said Sami Alawieh, head of the Litani River National Authority.",
      "This summer, after an unusually dry winter left Lebanon without the water reserves its usually banks through snow and rainfall, it has shrunk to the size of a pond, surrounded by a vast expanse of parched land.",
      "Although an average of 350 million cubic meters (12.4 billion cubic feet) of water flows into the lake during the rainy season each year, meeting about one-third of Lebanon's annual demand, this year the incoming water didn't exceed 45 million cubic meters (1.6 billion cubic feet), he said.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s water woes have further exacerbated the drought in Syria, which partially relies on rivers flowing in from its western neighbor.",

      "\u201cThere is no compensation for the loss of crops,\" Haj Salah said. \"And you know the farmers make just enough to get by.\"",
      "Mostafa Summaq, director of water resources in Idlib province, said the groundwater dropped by more than 10 meters (33 feet) in three months in some monitoring wells, which he attributed to farmers overpumping due to a lack of rain. Local officials are considering installing metered irrigation systems, but it would be too expensive to do without assistance, he said.",
      "Most experts agree that Syria and the broader region appear headed toward worse climate shocks, which they aren't prepared to absorb.",
      "Climate change makes some regions wetter and others drier, and the Middle East and Mediterranean are among those that are drying out, said Matti Kummu, a professor at Aalto University in Finland who specializes in global food and water issues. Syria, specifically, has shown a trend of reduced rainfall over the past 40 years, while it has been using water at an unsustainable rate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough water from rainfall or from snowmelt in the mountains to recharge the groundwater,\u201d Kummu said. Due to increasing irrigation needs, he said, \"the groundwater table is going lower and lower, which means that it\u2019s less accessible and requires more energy (to pump).\" At some point, the groundwater might run out.",
      "Even with limited means, the country could take measures to mitigate the impacts, such as increased rainwater harvesting, switching to more drought-tolerant crops and trying to put more effective irrigation systems in place, even simple ones.",

      "If you have trouble finding dates, spare a thought for Ned, a perfectly nice snail with dire romantic prospects",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",
      "Ned\u2019s shell coils to the left, not the right, making him the 1 in 40,000 snails whose sex organs don\u2019t line up with those of the rest of their species. Unless another lefty snail is found, the young gastropod faces a lifetime of unintentional celibacy.",
      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",

      "NEW YORK -- C-SPAN said Wednesday that it had reached a deal to have its three channels air on YouTube TV and Hulu's live television feed, ending a dispute that had led to a revenue squeeze for the public affairs network in the cord-cutting era.",
      "The network said the streaming services would pay the same fee as cable and satellite companies, roughly 87 cents a year per subscriber, and that C-SPAN would continue its no-advertising policy on television.",
      "Congress involved itself in the issue, passing a resolution this spring calling on the services' parent companies \u2014 Alphabet for YouTube and Disney for Hulu \u2014 to add C-SPAN to their programming mix. Because congressional sessions and hearings represent a big portion of C-SPAN's programming, the politicians faced diminished airtime without a deal.",
      "At its peak a decade ago, C-SPAN was seen in some 100 million homes with television. The number of homes paying for TV has since dropped to some 70 million, with roughly 20 million of those consumers now getting television through services like YouTube and Hulu, and they weren't showing C-SPAN.",
      "C-SPAN said its revenues had dropped from nearly $64 million in 2019 to $45.4 million in 2023.",

      "After Trump's 50-minute Oval Office appearance, televised in full on Fox News, network anchor Martha MacCallum laughed at a reference to the issue. \u201cBiden was missing in action for days or weeks,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump sought to make his predecessor's condition an issue both before and after voters returned him to the presidency. In June, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's use of the autopen for presidential signatures and whether his aides purposely shielded the public from evidence of Biden's physical and mental decline.",
      "In part because of that, former NBC \u201cMeet the Press\u201d anchor Chuck Todd said in a podcast Tuesday that Trump and his team had only themselves to blame for the way the president's health became an issue. \u201cI do think they're susceptible to a feeding frenzy,\u201d he said.",
      "Beyond punditry, however, news outlets face serious questions about how to handle the story, much like they did with Biden. The physical signs that have been pointed out online should trigger serious probes into the president's health. Some critics, like historian Garrett Graff, said it was puzzling that many in the media hadn't treated it like a news story \u2014 although the timing over a holiday weekend surely made it more challenging.",
      "\u201cEvidence-based assessments of a president's health are absolutely fair game,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. That could include observations like the president's bruising or falling asleep at meetings, and analyses of what drugs the president is taking and why.",
      "\u201cSimilarly, radio silence from a prominent office holder, especially one who appears on media frequently, is a valuable thing for journalists to report,\u201d Grueskin said. \u201cI don't think that news organizations need to publish those \u2018everyone is talking about XYZ on social media, so we need to repeat it\u2019 stories.\u201d",
      "The issue of press coverage of Biden's health was widely discussed last year, and renewed again this spring with the publication of \u201cOriginal Sin: President Biden\u2019s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\u201d by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.",
      "Given all that, Graff wrote in a Substack post that \u201cyou'd think reporters would be falling all over themselves to dig deeper right now. Clearly, there's enough smoke to warrant at least a major story in a major outlet investigating whether there is fire.\u201d",

      "Paul Colford, an inexhaustibly curious journalist and author who covered the media business for decades before becoming The Associated Press\u2019 chief spokesperson, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Paul Colford, an inexhaustibly curious journalist and author who covered the media business for decades before seeing it from another vantage point as The Associated Press' chief spokesperson, has died. He was 71.",
      "Colford, who retired from the AP in 2017, died Aug. 26 after a fall the previous month turned a long struggle with Parkinson's disease into a rapid decline, said his wife, Anne LaBate. Despite his health problems, he was working even in recent months on his third book, about a notorious figure from his hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey.",
      "During a decade as AP's director and ultimately vice president of media relations, Colford was known for his sage, unflappable handling of the news cooperative's dealings with other media outlets, from requests for interviews with its journalists to inquiries about its practices.",
      "\u201cPaul was both graceful and tough and believed completely in the AP\u2019s journalists and their mission. That was important during some pretty tough moments, particularly when an AP journalist was hurt or worse,\" said Kathleen Carroll, who was the news service's executive editor from 2002 to 2016. She recalled Colford as \u201ca talented and classy colleague\u201d who loved journalism.",
      "Colford knew the media ecosystem from the inside out and the outside in, having been a media reporter and columnist for the Daily News of New York, Newsday and the former New York Newsday. He covered magazines, book publishing, newspapers' digital evolution and the new media of the dot-com era. Reporting on the radio landscape as conservative talk rose to prominence, Colford penned unauthorized biographies of Rush Limbaugh and shock jock Howard Stern.",
      "\u201cHe just was indefatigable,\u201d said longtime Newsday TV writer and critic Verne Gay, a colleague and friend of Colford's. \u201cHe vacuumed everything up. He knew everything and everybody. And he constantly broke stories on the beat.... I was just in awe of him.\"",
      "Born Sept. 24, 1953, in Jersey City, Colford grew up there with seven siblings and graduated in 1975 from St. Peter's University. He spent part of his college years studying in Turin, Italy, and still spoke Italian in phone calls with friends from that time, his wife said.",
      "His early jobs included a stint at The Courier News of central New Jersey, where the couple met and dated for a time in the 1970s. He took her to the first Shakespeare in the Park production she ever attended, she recalled.",
      "The relationship fizzled, Colford went on to New York Newsday and later the Daily News, and he married the late Jane Colford and had two children, Catherine and Liam. He and LaBate still had ties through friends and family, and they got back together after he was widowed.",
      "\u201cWe certainly both had lived whole lives\u201d in the meantime, she said, but \u201cit was probably even a clearer connection.\u201d They married in 2022.",
      "Colford's professional life also had evolved. He took the AP's media relations job in 2007.",

      "\u201cTo him, it was a natural extension of everything he'd ever done, which was: collect the facts, make sure that everything is accurate, make sure people get information in a timely manner,\u201d Gay said. \u201cIt was about getting information to people who needed it.\u201d",
      "The job, in a 24/7 global news operation, is not easy. Tom Kent, who was AP's standards editor during much of Colford's tenure, recalled him as invaluable in responding to public controversies that erupted at times over its reports.",
      "As editors debated, readers and viewers complained and other news outlets called for comment, Colford kept his cool and gave smart guidance about how best to react, said Kent, now a consultant. He said editors and executives ended up taking Colford's advice, which came with \u201ca journalistic sensitivity and ethical integrity that won the confidence and respect of journalists and editors across the AP.\u201d",
      "Lauren Easton, whom Colford hired in a junior role, is now an AP vice president overseeing global communications. She said he was \u201ca fierce defender of The Associated Press, always stepping up to advocate for press freedom, access and the importance of factual, nonpartisan journalism.\u201d",
      "Colford was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease while still at AP and kept working for a while before deciding to retire, his wife and friends said.",
      "In retirement, he was delighted that the Briscoe Center for American History, housed at the University of Texas at Austin, acquired his trove of audiotapes, videos, photos, newspaper clippings and other materials from his journalism career. And he worked on his book, amassing a new batch of news clippings and other research in his home office in Trenton, N.J., said Gay, who visited him in June.",
      "\u201cPaul just never let go,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a dedicated, incredibly hardworking dude.\u201d",

      "The trend of ditching traditional office space to work from living rooms and hotels accelerated when the coronavirus hit in 2020",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kate Smith worked a 9-to-5 office job, she was burned-out, suffering from daily migraines and thinking, \u201cI can't do this for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "She didn't have to. For her next role, Smith landed a remote, full-time marketing job that enabled her to travel the world.",
      "Her laptop lifestyle took her to Bali, where she lived and worked for a year-and-a-half. \u201cEvery day, I was riding my scooter through the rice fields and thinking, \u2018I love my life, this is amazing,'\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that feeling never fades. ... I feel so grateful for the freedom and flexibility.\u201d",
      "While Smith, 36, has worked remotely for more than a decade, the trend of ditching traditional office spaces to work from living rooms or beachfront shacks accelerated in 2020, when the coronavirus hit and workers who could began performing their jobs from home.",
      "Many people grew accustomed to the lifestyle change once they tasted the freedom and flexibility a home office afforded. Working parents enjoyed meeting children at the school bus. Others found more time for exercise, socializing and basking in nature once their jobs did not include long commutes.",
      "But after the pandemic subsided, many large companies began calling employees back into the office, creating fierce competition for jobs that could be done from anywhere. Many positions advertised as remote attract hundreds, if not more than a thousand, of applications, experts said.",
      "\u201cFully remote is very rare now in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Ma, associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt is getting much more difficult and you need to look for the smaller firms or medium-sized firms ... and those firms do not provide as competitive financial packages as the big firms, but they try to attract talent by providing more flexibility.\u201d",
      "About 9% of paid U.S. job postings on social networking platform LinkedIn in July offered remote work, while those types of roles attracted 37% of applications, according to the company.",
      "Below, employers and people who haven't returned to an office offer advice on how to land remote jobs in a competitive climate.",
      "The biggest concern for an employer hiring remote workers is ensuring they will do their work, said Carla Rover, co-founder of Strategy and Content, a startup that leverages artificial intelligence.",

This is how much I\u2019ve built in a period of time,\u2019\u201d said Rover, who mostly has worked remotely since 2010. Assembling a strong portfolio showcases what you can do while working outside an office, Rover advised.",

      "If you've worked remotely before, highlight that on your resume. List communication tools you've used, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, said Dawn Fay, operational president at staffing firm Robert Half International. \u201cCall out that you have worked remotely, independently, for X amount of time successfully,\" Fay added. \"You really want to stress that.\u201d",
      "After moving on from the office job that made her miserable, Smith created a side hustle coaching other professionals who longed for a nomadic lifestyle. Her coaching eventually grew into a full-time job.",
      "When looking to transition into remote work, find a job that's similar to your current role instead of competing with better-qualified candidates for jobs that require more experience, she advised. \u201cGet your foot in the door ... and then from there work your way to the long-term goal,\u201d Smith said.",
      "You can also try to convert your current job into a remote role. That's what Courtney Sandifer attempted after her husband, 60, had a heart attack and underwent cancer treatment within the same year. He retired early and they bought a small property in Mexico near the beach, hoping to reduce stress. \u201cWe just got tired of the rat race,\u201d Sandifer said.",

      "A midstage study of the psychedelic drug LSD showed positive results for easing symptoms in people with generalized anxiety disorder",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 LSD reduced symptoms of anxiety in a midstage study published Thursday, paving the way for additional testing and possible medical approval of a psychedelic drug that has been banned in the U.S. for more than a half century.",
      "The results from drugmaker Mindmed tested several doses of LSD in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder, with the benefits lasting as long as three months. The company plans to conduct follow-up studies to confirm the results and then apply for Food and Drug Administration approval.",
      "Beginning in the 1950s, researchers published a flurry of papers exploring LSD's therapeutic uses, though most of them don't meet modern standards.",
      "\u201cI see this paper as a clear step in the direction of reviving that old research, applying our modern standards and determining what are the real costs and benefits of these compounds,\u201d said Frederick Barrett, who directs Johns Hopkins University\u2019s psychedelic center and was not involved in the research.",
      "Psychedelics are in the midst of a popular and scientific comeback, with conferences, documentaries, books and medical journals exploring their potential for conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "The FDA has designated psilocybin, MDMA and now LSD as potential \u201cbreakthrough\u201d therapies based on early results.",
      "Still, the drugs have not had a glide path to the market.",
      "Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA \u2014 also known as ecstasy \u2014 as a treatment for PTSD, citing flawed study methods, potential research bias and other issues.",
      "The new LSD study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, addresses some of those problems.",
      "MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy.",
      "The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD \u2014 under professional supervision, but without therapy \u2014 and then were followed for about three months.",
      "The paper does not detail how patients were prepared for the experience or what sort of follow-up they received, which is crucial to understanding the research, Barrett noted.",
      "\u201cIn many cases people can have such powerful, subjective experiences that they may need to talk to a therapist to help them make sense of it,\u201d he said.",
      "For the study, researchers measured anxiety symptoms in nearly 200 patients who randomly received one of four doses of LSD or a placebo. The main aim was to find the optimal dose of the drug, which can cause intense visual hallucinations and occasionally feelings of panic or paranoia.",
      "At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose \u2014 100 milligrams \u2014 continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches.",
      "Patients who got dummy pills also improved \u2014 a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies \u2014 but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug.",

      "Generalized anxiety disorder is among the most common mental disorders, affecting nearly 3% of U.S. adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Current treatments include psychotherapy, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.",
      "The possibility of using LSD as a medical treatment isn\u2019t new.",
      "In the 1950s and 1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting LSD's use treating alcohol addiction, depression and other conditions. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to \u201cturn on, tune in and dropout.\u201d",
      "A 1970 law classifying LSD and other psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs \u2014 without any medical use and high potential for abuse \u2014 essentially halted U.S. research.",
      "When a handful of nonprofits begin reassessing the drugs in the 1980s and 1990s, they focused on lesser-known hallucinogens like MDMA and psilocybin, the main ingredient in magic mushrooms, to avoid the historic controversies surrounding LSD.",
      "\u201cLSD was right there in front of everybody, but Mindmed is the first company that actually decided to evaluate it,\u201d Fava said.",

      "It's an issue uniting the left and the right",
      "WASHINGTON -- An unusual alliance emerged in the House on Wednesday as lawmakers, who agree on little else, rallied support for a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their families from owning and trading individual stocks.",
      "The group included darlings of the far right, the left, moderates and many in between. They gathered to promote a ban that polls well with voters and appears to be finding new momentum after stalling out in previous sessions of Congress.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see this cast of characters up here,\u201d said Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican who represents a perennial swing district in Pennsylvania. \"You\u2019re all smirking out there. That\u2019s a good thing. It speaks to the power of this cause.\u201d",
      "Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there\u2019s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.",
      "A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents \u2014 while notably exempting Republican President Donald Trump. The House bill unveiled this week is limited to Congress, but the sponsors said they were open to extending it to the executive branch if enough support emerged.",
      "Under current law, federal lawmakers are required to disclose their stock sales and purchases. The bill requiring disclosure, The Stock Act, was signed into law in 2012. At the time, lawmakers and government watchdogs predicted that public disclosure would shame lawmakers out of actively buying and selling stock. That hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "The sponsors said they merged their own, individual bills on banning stocks and came together with a single bipartisan effort. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, the bill's lead sponsor, said that the group had been meeting for the last several months, and some sponsors had actually been working on this for years. About a dozen lawmakers from both parties joined Roy on stage. It was an unusually festive moment as the partisan lines in Congress have rarely been sharper.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t agree with some of these people on anything,\u201d said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican often aligned with the the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.",
      "Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. followed Burchett to the podium and fist-bumped him when doing so. She said she felt like the coalition showed how Congress should actually work. \u201cIt feels foreign and it feels alien and it\u2019s like, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d she said.",

Lawmakers who currently own individual stocks and bonds would have 180 days to divest. New members would have 90 days to divest upon taking office.",
      "The mood was celebratory at Wednesday's unveiling, but even if the bill were to pass the House, it would face a more difficult climb in the Senate. At least 60 votes would be needed to advance the legislation in that chamber and some senators have expressed concerns about the concept.",
      "Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., acknowledged that members opposed to banning stocks are \u201cpersistent.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose of us who support banning stock trading in Congress are very vocal in our position, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t opponents,\u201d Magaziner said.",

      "\u201cWe do have insider trading laws. We have financial disclosure. Trust me, we have financial disclosure,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t see the necessity of this.\u201d",

      "Also helping to steady Wall Street was a calming bond market. A day earlier, rising yields for government bonds around the world raised the pressure on the stock market. Yields climbed on worries about governments\u2019 abilities to repay their growing mountains of debt, as well as concerns that President Donald Trump\u2019s pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates could lead to higher inflation in the long term.",
      "Such worries have pushed investors to demand higher yields in order to lend money to governments worldwide. And when bonds are paying more in interest, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks, which are riskier investments.",
      "On Wednesday, Treasury yields retreated following the latest report on the U.S. job market to come in weaker than expected. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.21% from 4.28% late Tuesday, for example.",
      "The report showed that U.S. employers were advertising 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists had forecast. The number bolsters the growing sense on Wall Street that the job market may be ossifying into a low-hire, low-fire state.",
      "A weakened job market could push the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting, which is scheduled for later this month. That\u2019s the widespread expectation among traders.",

      "Leaving devices plugged in can result in phantom energy, which is the power consumed by appliances that draw electricity even when they\u2019re turned off or not in use",
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\u201cPhantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they\u2019ve improved over time,\u201d said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\u201cThe good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\u201d said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\u201cJust take a little step of unplugging the things that you\u2019re not using,\u201d said Charron. \u201cIt will save you money and it\u2019ll save emissions in the long run.\u201d",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\u201cDo you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you\u2019re not using it?\u201d said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",

      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you\u2019re not using that could be draining energy help, too.

      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not using it, then you\u2019re getting no benefit, yet you\u2019re paying the price and increased the energy use,\u201d said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cThe question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\u201d said Gilligan. \u201cPhantom power is one part of this.\u201d",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being irresponsible.",
      "\u201cThis is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\u201d said Giligan.",

      "The Trump administration since January has moved to reverse years of legal and policy gains for transgender Americans, from stripping government websites of \u201cgender ideology\u201d to reinstituting a ban on transgender service members in the military",
      "Marc Seawright took pride in his job at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where he worked for more than eight years and most recently oversaw technology policy to support the agency\u2019s mission of combating workplace harassment and discrimination.",
      "But then President Donald Trump began targeting transgender and nonbinary people within hours of returning to the White House by issuing a series of executive orders \u2014 including one declaring the existence of two unchangeable sexes. Seawright was ordered to develop technology to scrub any mention of LGBTQ+ identities from all EEOC outreach materials, which had been created to help employers understand their obligations under civil rights law.",
      "Suddenly, his tech expertise \"was being leveraged to perpetuate discrimination against people like me,\" said Seawright, 41, who served as the EEOC's director of information governance and strategy before he quit in June, citing a hostile work environment. \"It became overwhelming. It felt insurmountable.\u201d",
      "A San Francisco-based Army veteran, Seawright is one of 10 transgender and gender nonconforming government employees across federal agencies who spoke with The Associated Press about their workplace experiences since Trump regained office, describing their fear, grief, frustration, and distress working for an employer that rejects their identity \u2014 often with no clear path for recourse or support. Several requested anonymity for fear of retaliation; some, including Seawright, have filed formal discrimination complaints.",
      "Since January, the Trump administration has reversed years of legal and policy gains for transgender Americans, from stripping government websites of \u201cgender ideology\u201d to reinstituting a ban on transgender service members in the military.",
      "The White House and the EEOC declined to respond to allegations that the president's policies created a hostile workplace for transgender federal employees. But his executive order, which defines sex as strictly male or female, states that its goal is to protect spaces designated for women and girls.",
      "\u201cEfforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being,\u201d the order says.",
      "Independent Women, a nonprofit that advocates for legislation defining sex as male and female, supports Trump's executive order.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s rights can get erased if men can just self-identify to women\u2019s spaces,\u201d said the organization's senior legal adviser Beth Parlato.",
      "Brad Sears, senior scholar at UCLA School of Law\u2019s Williams Institute, which researches policy impacting LGBTQ+ people, points to \u201ca sweeping, government-wide initiative to really erase transgender people from public life,\u201d including adults in the workplace.",
      "\u201cThe federal workplace is increasingly an inhospitable place for the transgender employees who remain,\u201d Sears said.",
      "Compared to private sector workers, transgender federal employees are especially vulnerable because many ultimately answer to the president, said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy at Advocates for Trans Equality, which seeks legal and political rights for transgender people in the United States.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of an ability to impose their will directly on employers throughout the country, this administration is going to use the tools that they have to attack the trans people who are in close proximity to them, and that includes federal workers,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "After serving as the first openly transgender soldier in the Illinois National Guard, LeAnne Withrow retired from the military due to injury, and now works in a federal civilian role helping military families access resources.",
      "Withrow visits armories across Illinois for her job, sometimes in remote areas. But Trump's executive order directing agencies to take \u201cappropriate action\u201d to ensure that intimate spaces \"are designated by sex and not identity\u201d created a major hurdle for Withrow when her supervisors informed her that she was no longer allowed to use the women\u2019s restroom at work.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t use men\u2019s spaces because I don\u2019t feel comfortable doing that,\u201d the 34-year-old said.",

      "A spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard declined to comment on the pending lawsuit but said the agency is \u201ccommitted to treating all of our employees with dignity and respect.\u201d The Department of Defense also declined to comment, citing policy, but affirmed its commitment to enforcing relevant laws and implementing the gender executive order.",
      "For Seawright at the EEOC, he feels like his skill set was being wielded against the agency\u2019s mission, not to support it. Following Trump's signing of his executive order, Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, quickly began reshaping policy and, among other things, removed the agency\u2019s \u201cpronoun app,\u201d which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their profiles. It was a tool that was created \u2014 then dismantled \u2014 by Seawright.",
      "He had spent two years developing the app to support a nonbinary employee at the agency.",
      "\u201cFor it to be just kind of yanked away summarily with none of the thoughtfulness and planning that went into implementing the tool ... that became really frustrating,\" Seawright said.",
      "His mental health suffered, and he requested extended personal leave shortly after he completed the project scrubbing references to gender identity. When he returned in late February, the situation continued to deteriorate.",
      "He hired lawyers at Katz Banks Kumin and filed a formal discrimination complaint. In June, Seawright resigned, citing \u201csignificant distress, anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, anger, and sadness\u201d caused daily by Lucas\u2019 \"anti-transgender actions.\u201d",

      "SiriusXM announced that it was giving Beshear's new podcast a national platform starting this month, along with featuring him in a regular call-in show on its Progress network.",
      "President Donald Trump's appearances on podcasts were a pivotal media strategy in his successful 2024 Republican campaign. Moving forward, mastering a personal podcast could replace soft-focus biographies or wonky books as a way for politicians to increase their profiles.",
      "Beshear said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this summer that he will \u201ctake a look\u201d at running for president in 2028. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also in the circle of potential presidential nominees, started his own podcast earlier this year.",
      "In an interview, Beshear said a motivating factor in his own podcast was people who have come up to him, especially during the Trump administration, to talk about their anxieties.",
      "\u201cThat's how Americans feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel like the news hits them minute after minute after minute. And it can feel like chaos. It can feel like the world is out of control. With this podcast, we're trying to help Americans process what we're going through.\u201d",
      "He's already done nearly two dozen podcasts, with his audience heavily weighted toward Kentucky residents. His guests have included some potential Democratic presidential rivals, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban, former Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari and Kentucky-born actor and comic Steve Zahn have also appeared.",
      "Beshear, the son of a former governor who's been leading Kentucky since 2019, talks issues himself. Two of his friends, a Republican and a Democrat, are regular guests, and his 16-year-old son helps Dad navigate some youthful lingo.",
      "Newsom attracted attention \u2014 some of it negative among Democrats \u2014 for interviewing conservative guests Steve Bannon, Michael Savage and Charlie Kirk on his podcast.",
      "\u201cI did disagree with him on certain guests because I don't like to give oxygen to hate,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cBut Gavin is out there really working to communicate with the American people, and he deserves to be commended for it.\u201d",
      "Newsom's podcast started slowly in the marketplace but has caught fire in recent weeks, his regular audiences jumping from the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands, said Paul Riismandel, president of Signal Hill Insights, an audio-focused market research company.",
      "The California governor's increased visibility, particularly on social media, is likely a factor in the growing popularity of the podcast, Riismandel said. But it's also a function of how podcasts often catch on: Many tend to be slow burns as audiences discover them, he said.",

      "A new paper from Vanderbilt University suggests Americans could save about $100 billion annually if credit card interest rates were capped at 10%, as proposed by President Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans would save roughly $100 billion a year in interest costs if President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% were implemented, according to a paper published by Vanderbilt University on Thursday.",
      "Further, the banks and credit card companies would be able to withstand, and even still be profitable, if there were to be a national cap on interest rates. While limited in scope, the paper gives some academic backing to President Trump\u2019s campaign promise.",
      "The paper found that banks would still be able to earn a profit on most of their customers even if credit card interest rates were capped at 15%, and if the banks continued to offer rewards and perks like points and airport lounge access. If interest rates were capped at 10%, the business model gets more difficult for the banks, but they could still make money off most card customers by cutting back on some rewards.",
      "Usury laws are as old as the Bible but have gotten traction again through Trump's populist politics. When he was a candidate in the 2024 election, Trump proposed a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates. He has not spoken about it since the election.",
      "That said, politicians have seized on the idea. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill in Congress that would match Trump\u2019s campaign proposal of capping interest rates at 10%. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York.",
      "There are already some interest rate caps in effect in the U.S. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active servicemen and women more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions, the NCUA, has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.",
      "The banking industry is adamantly against any caps on credit card rates. Historically, the industry has argued that any cap on interest rates would decimate the credit card business model and would threaten the viability of popular rewards and perks programs that millions of Americans use for free flights and hotel stays.",
      "It was this rhetoric that made Brian Shearer, the author of the report, start to look into the issue. Shearer previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as the regulator\u2019s assistant director of policy planning and strategy, working under Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "\u201cI wanted to see if President Trump\u2019s proposed cap could be taken seriously, and the idea appears that it could be seriously considered and it would not have the amount of downside that often the pundits assume there will be,\u201d Shearer said.",

      "Americans are carrying more credit card debt than ever before, to the tune of $1.21 trillion, or roughly $6,400 per person. The average credit card interest rate is roughly 21%, according to data from the Federal Reserve. That\u2019s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.",
      "Banks earn revenue from credit cards two different ways: the amount of money they charge merchants to process a credit card transaction, often referred to as interchange, and the interest and fees the banks charge customers. That could be the annual fee on a credit card, or the monthly interest that accrues when a customer carries a balance.",
      "Shearer says the revenue earned from interchange is why banks would remain profitable, even if credit card interest rates are capped. Credit card rewards programs are largely funded through interchange. American Express, for instance, earned $35.2 billion in revenue from the fees they charge merchants.",
      "Under Shearer\u2019s analysis, if interest rates were capped at 15%, Americans would save roughly $48 billion in interest a year, while at 10%, that figure goes to $100 billion. In his analysis, Shearer assumed that banks would charge as close to the national cap as possible.",
      "The Vanderbilt paper finds that banks, because they largely fund their rewards programs from interchange, would not likely universally cut back on rewards for Americans. Instead, the Americans who would likely see the biggest reduction in rewards would be those with low credit scores, because they are considered the riskiest borrowers. However, Shearer believes that any modest reduction in rewards for those customers would likely be made up in the interest they would save annually. Historically, bank customers with low credit scores tend to be \"revolvers\", or those who carry a balance, instead of \u201ctransactors,\u201d which are customers who pay off their credit cards at the end of each month.",
      "\u201cIt is true that there would need to be some reward reduction, but it\u2019s not the kind of sky-is-falling story that you often hear,\u201d Shearer said.",

      "Under Holness, Jamaica has seen a 43% drop in killings so far this year, marking the most significant decline in decades.

      "Things began with a brief high point of a crisp season-opening touchdown drive and an immediate defensive stand. What followed was a gamelong descent that picked up speed on the way to a third-quarter crash that emptied out a packed Kenan Stadium well before the final period, all coming with the eyes of the college football world locked on Chapel Hill.",
      "Belichick said the goal now was to move past the TCU loss \u201cas fast as we can\u201d and sort out what works, what doesn't and what can improve quickly.",

      "By the end, UNC had given up the most points in an opener in program history. The Horned Frogs also posted the highest score allowed by a Belichick-coached team at any level going back to his 29-year run as an NFL head coach, the previous high being 47 points against the Buffalo Bills in a 2021 wild-card playoff game.",
      "TCU scored 41 straight points after falling behind 7-0. That also created a rare scenario: there had been only four games in Belichick's 511 NFL regular-season and playoff games that he had trailed by at least 34 points.",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

      "\u201cWe had a very robust conversation: Should we recreate a new women\u2019s singles champion's trophy? In the end, we made the decision to stay with history and to not change the trophy itself, but to ensure that the replica trophy was of the same size as the men\u2019s,\u201d said Allaster, who is the chief executive of professional tennis at the USTA. \u201cTrophies are so iconic to the history of this championships, and we just didn't feel it was the right thing to move away from that history, but ... (we wanted) to be able to award the singles champions the same sizes.\u201d",
      "King wasn't aware of the switch until the AP asked her about it.",
      "\u201cI did not know they did that. It\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s equal,\" King said. \"It sends very positive messaging that we matter just as much. Our trophy\u2019s just as big.\u201d",

      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",

      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",
      "Some users say the debate is just a rehash of old arguments about once-new technology that eventually became widely used, such as AutoTune, drum machines and synthesizers.",

I see it as any other tool that we have,\u201d said Scott Smith, whose AI band, Pulse Empire, was inspired by 1980s British synthesizer-driven groups like New Order and Depeche Mode.",
      "Smith, 56 and a semi-retired former U.S. Navy public affairs officer in Portland, Oregon, said \u201cmusic producers have lots of tools in their arsenal\u201d to enhance recordings that listeners aren't aware of.",
      "Like McCann, Smith never mastered a musical instrument. Both say they put lots of time and effort into crafting their music.",
      "Once Smith gets inspiration, it takes him just 10 minutes to write the lyrics. But then he'll spend as much as eight to nine hours generating different versions until the song \u201cmatches my vision.\u201d",
      "McCann said he'll often create up to 100 different versions of a song by prompting and re-prompting the AI system before he\u2019s satisfied.",
      "AI song generators can churn out lyrics as well as music, but many experienced users prefer to write their own words.",
      "\u201cAI lyrics tend to come out quite cliche and quite boring,\u201d McCann said.",
      "Lukas Rams, a Philadelphia-area resident who makes songs for his AI band Sleeping With Wolves, said AI lyrics tend to be \u201cextra corny\u201d and not as creative as a human, but can help get the writing process started.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll do very basic rhyme schemes, and it\u2019ll keep repeating the same structure,\u201d said Rams, who writes his own words, sometimes while putting his kids to bed and waiting for them to fall asleep. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get words in there that are very telling of AI-generated lyrics, like \u2018neon,\u2019 anything with \u2018shadows\u2019.\u201d",
      "Rams used to play drums in high school bands and collaborated with his brother on their own songs, but work and family life started taking up more of his time.",
      "Then he discovered AI, which he used to create three albums for Sleeping With Wolves. He's been taking it seriously, making a CD jewel case with album art. He plans to post his songs, which combine metalcore and EDM, more widely online.",
      "\u201cI do want to start putting this up on YouTube or socials or distribution or whatever, just to have it out there,\u201d Rams said. \u201cI might as well, otherwise I\u2019m literally the only person that hears this stuff.\u201d",
      "Experts say AI's potential to let anyone come up with a hit song is poised to shake up the music industry's production pipeline.",
      "\"Just think about what it used to cost to make a hit or make something that breaks,\" Antonuccio said. \"And that just keeps winnowing down from a major studio to a laptop to a bedroom. And now it\u2019s like a text prompt \u2014 several text prompts.\u201d",
      "But he added that AI music is still in a \u201cWild West\u201d phase because of the lack of legal clarity over copyright. He compared it to the legal battles more than two decades ago over file-sharing sites like Napster that heralded the transition from CDs to digital media and eventually paved the way for today's music streaming services.",
      "Creators hope AI, too, will eventually become a part of the mainstream music world.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world where anyone, anywhere could make the next big hit,\u201d said McCann. \u201cAs AI becomes more widely accepted among people as a musical art form, I think it opens up the possibility for AI music to be featured in charts.\u201d",

      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",

      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028.

      "For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn\u2019t have drones.",
      "But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they're using them to blast AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.",

      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",

      "If those don't work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that's not among the randomized presets.

      "\u201cWolves are frightened of novel things,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cI know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\u201d",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

      "Details about the operation are scant, but President Donald Trump has amped up the rhetoric about crime in the nation\u2019s third-largest city, saying an immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment are planned despite the objections of local leaders and a federal court ruling that a similar deployment in Los Angeles was illegal.",
      "The preparations seem familiar in the Democratic stronghold that\u2019s often found itself in Trump\u2019s crosshairs.",
      "Still, leaders of schools, churches and community groups \u2014 particularly in the city\u2019s immigrant enclaves and Black and Latino neighborhoods \u2014 say there\u2019s increased gravity and coordination in preparing for the expected troop deployment and its accompanying deluge of attention.",

      "Immigrant communities have been on high alert since Trump took office for the second time in January and kicked off a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
      "Activists say they\u2019ve already offered countless know-your-rights training sessions and have added hours for a hotline where people can report immigration arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order reiterating the city\u2019s longtime sanctuary policies, which bar local police from coordinating with federal immigration agents.",
      "Trump signaled this week that he\u2019s ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago despite the objections of Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Trump hasn't given a timeline for the Chicago operation, and he muddied the outlook again on Wednesday by suggesting New Orleans as the next possible location.",
      "Trump's administration indicated that it would soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, and the Department of Homeland Security requested limited logistical support at the Naval Station Great Lakes outside the city.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An unusual alliance emerged in the House on Wednesday as lawmakers who agree on little else rallied support for a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their families from owning and trading individual stocks.",
      "The group included darlings of the far right, the left, moderates and many in between. They gathered to promote a ban that polls well with voters and appears to be finding new momentum after stalling out in previous sessions of Congress.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see this cast of characters up here,\u201d said Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican who represents a perennial swing district in Pennsylvania. \"You\u2019re all smirking out there. That\u2019s a good thing. It speaks to the power of this cause.\u201d",

      "A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents \u2014 while notably exempting Republican President Donald Trump. The House bill unveiled this week is limited to Congress, but the sponsors said they were open to extending it to the executive branch if enough support emerged.",
      "Under current law, federal lawmakers are required to disclose their stock sales and purchases. The bill requiring disclosure, The Stock Act, was signed into law in 2012. At the time, lawmakers and government watchdogs predicted that public disclosure would shame lawmakers out of actively buying and selling stock. That hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "The sponsors said they merged their own, individual bills on banning stocks and came together with a single bipartisan effort. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, the bill's lead sponsor, said that the group had been meeting for the last several months, and some sponsors had actually been working on this for years. About a dozen lawmakers from both parties joined Roy on stage. It was an unusually festive moment as the partisan lines in Congress have rarely been sharper.",

      "The mood was celebratory at Wednesday's unveiling, but even if the bill were to pass the House, it would face a more difficult climb in the Senate. At least 60 votes would be needed to advance the legislation in that chamber and some senators have expressed concerns about the concept.",

      "Currently, there are only seven Federal Railroad Administration employees trained to assess bridges, although their primary responsibility is to review each railroad's inspection plan to make sure they have a good plan in place and that won't change.

      "Jared Cassity, who is the National Safety Director for the nation\u2019s largest rail union, SMART-TD, agreed that having more people trained to spot bridge problems is a good thing, but these inspectors still have more than 70,000 railroad bridges out there across the country to assess.",

But that issue is primarily at smaller short-line railroads. The Federal Railroad Administration said that the biggest railroads that deliver more than 90% of the nation's freight have all been audited on a regular basis.",

It said she is alleged to have slammed her forearm into the body and forcibly grabbed an HSI officer. The resolution also said body camera and other video evidence supported the allegations made in the federal indictment.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic took a two-set lead against Taylor Fritz, an opponent he always beats, to close in on the semifinals, a round he often reaches at the U.S. Open, and marked the occasion by blowing kisses to those in Tuesday night's crowd pulling for the last American man in the field.",
      "That was just a taste of the back-and-forth between Djokovic and some of the folks in the Arthur Ashe Stadium seats, and there was still work that remained, but he would finish off a 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 victory.

But on the last, the contest ended anticlimactically with a double-fault by No. 4-seeded Fritz, whose exit means the U.S. drought will continue without a male singles champion at any major since 2003, when Andy Roddick won in New York.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s one of the things that makes the great players great,\u201d Fritz said about Djokovic. \u201cThey win the big points.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Djokovic will play in his fourth Slam semifinal of the season and take on five-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz, who hasn't dropped a set in the tournament. He was a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 winner against No. 20 Jiri Lehecka earlier Tuesday.",

      "On Tuesday night, both men were dressed entirely in black \u2014 shirts, shorts, socks and shoes. Even Djokovic\u2019s wrist bands were black, as was Fritz\u2019s headband, which he had on wrong at the start, so the white lettering of his clothing sponsor\u2019s name was upside-down until he made a change after the second set.",
      "If the players\u2019 get-ups looked alike, that\u2019s where the similarities stopped. Djokovic, who has won four of his 24 major championships at the U.S. Open, most recently in 2023, did what he usually does to Fritz \u2014 and, to be fair, nearly everyone else \u2014 which is to say: return masterfully, control the longest points and serve to all the right spots, particularly in the clutch.",
      "In sum, the 38-year-old Djokovic was generally a step, and a thought, or two ahead of the 27-year-old Fritz, whose serve got better over the last two sets.",

      "A federal court hearing getting underway in Texas could be the final chance for families of some Boeing 737 Max crash victims to demand criminal prosecution of the company",
      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- Families of some of the 346 people killed in crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners held photos of their dead loved ones Wednesday outside a federal court in Texas, where a judge was hearing arguments on the U.S. government's motion to dismiss a felony conspiracy charge against the aerospace company in connection with the twin disasters.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O\u2019Connor set aside time for relatives of the crash victims to speak during the hearing. Some traveled from countries in Europe and Africa to pursue what could be their final opportunity to demand that the company face criminal prosecution for the crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia.",
      "\u201cMy daughter died on a new airplane that was defective and that was in operation because they weren\u2019t complying with regulations and because of fraud,\u201d said Nadia Milleron, a Massachusetts resident whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, was among the 157 passengers and crew members killed in the Ethiopia crash. \u201cI don\u2019t want any other any other family member to lose their loved ones because of this kind of fraud.\u201d",
      "In charging Boeing with conspiracy to defraud the government, prosecutors alleged Boeing deceived Federal Aviation Administration regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The hearing in Fort Worth comes more than four years after the Justice Department announced it had charged Boeing and reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the aircraft maker. That deal would have protected Boeing from criminal prosecution if it strengthened its ethics and legal compliance programs. But prosecutors revived the charge last year after deciding the company had violated certain terms of the agreement.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty to avoid a trial, but O\u2019Connor rejected that deal in December. The judge, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, cited concerns he had over how diversity policies both at the federal government and at Boeing could influence the selection of an independent monitor charged with overseeing the company's promised reforms.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the plea agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea, and they spent six months renegotiating with Boeing.",
      "In late May, the two sides struck a deal that took both the criminal charge and Boeing's guilty plea off the table. In exchange, Boeing said it would pay or invest another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims\u2019 families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "The Justice Department said it offered those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing has made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since last summer. It said the certainty of the agreement also served the public interest more effectively than taking the long-running case to trial and risking a jury verdict that might spare the company further punishment.",
      "Chris and Clariss Moore of Toronto, whose 24-year-old daughter, Danielle, also died when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia\u2019s Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, said in a statement that the pending agreement would allow Boeing to escape justice.",
      "\u201cThe safety of passengers will be held in the balance,\u201d the statement said.",

      "Justice Department lawyers said the families of 110 crash victims either support resolving the case before it reaches trial or do not oppose the new deal. The Justice Department has asked the judge to leave open the possibility of refiling the conspiracy charge if the company does not hold up its end of the deal over the next two years.",
      "While federal judges typically defer to the discretion of prosecutors in such situations, court approval is not automatic.",
      "The yearslong case centers around a software system that Boeing developed for the 737 Max, which began flying in 2017.",
      "In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, that software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months.",
      "Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.",
      "Acting on the incomplete information, prosecutors said, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots, avoiding the need for flight simulators that would have made it more expensive for airlines to adopt the latest version of the jetliner.",
      "The initial 2021 settlement agreement was on the verge of expiring last year when a panel covering an unused emergency exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon. No one was seriously injured, but it put Boeing\u2019s safety record under renewed scrutiny.",

      "U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs ruled the cuts amounted to illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands for changes to its governance and policies.",
      "The government had tied the freezes at Harvard to delays in dealing with antisemitism on its campus, but the judge said the federally funded research had little connection to antisemitism. \u201cA review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country\u2019s premier universities,\u201d Burroughs wrote.",
      "The ruling reverses a series of funding freezes that later became outright cuts as the Trump administration escalated its fight with the nation\u2019s wealthiest university. The administration also has sought to prevent the school from hosting foreign students and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status in a clash watched widely across higher education.",
      "Whether Harvard actually receives the money remains to be seen. If the ruling stands, it promises to revive Harvard\u2019s sprawling research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.",
      "Neither the White House nor Harvard responded immediately to requests for comment.",
      "Beyond the courthouse, the Trump administration and Harvard officials have been discussing a potential agreement that would end investigations and allow the university to regain access to federal funding. President Donald Trump has said he wants Harvard to pay no less than $500 million, but no deal has materialized, even as the administration has struck agreements with Columbia and Brown.",
      "Harvard\u2019s lawsuit accused the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. It was meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment on campus.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber pledged to fight antisemitism but said no government \u201cshould dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\u201d",
      "Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants the same day Harvard rejected the administration\u2019s demands. Education Secretary Linda McMahon declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.",

      "The judge's order reverses all of Harvard\u2019s federal funding freezes and cuts since April 14, and it bars the government from future cuts that violate Harvard\u2019s constitutional rights or run afoul of federal law.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade arrest in her courtroom by U.S. immigration agents will stand trial in December after she decided against appealing a federal judge's ruling rejecting her attempt to dismiss the case.",
      "Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan's attorneys said in federal court on Wednesday that she would not appeal the ruling at this time, but could later. U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman then scheduled her trial to begin Dec. 15. It is expected to last about a week. Jury selection is set for Dec. 11 and Dec. 12.",
      "Dugan's case has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump's administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.",
      "She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. Dugan argued that the charges should be dismissed, saying that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.",
      "Adelman last week rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.",

      "President Trump suggests New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard to fight crime",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard to fight crime, potentially expanding the number of cities around the nation where he may send federal law enforcement.",
      "Trump has already said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore following his administration deploying troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re making a determination now,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. \u201cDo we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that\u2019s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.\"",
      "Trump now frequently boasts about turning Washington into a \u201csafe zone.\u201d The White House reports more than 1,760 arrests citywide since the president first announced he was mobilizing federal forces on Aug. 7.",
      "But Washington is a federal district subject to laws giving Trump power to take over the local police force for up to 30 days. The decision to use troops to attempt to quell crime in other Democratic-controlled cities around the country would represent an important escalation.",
      "Trump's latest comments came a day after he declared \u201cWe're going in\u201d and suggested that the National Guard might soon be headed for Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, and Baltimore. That's despite state and local officials, as well as many residents, both places staunchly opposing the idea.",
      "New Orleans, however, is a Democrat-controlled in a red state run by Landry.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We\u2019ll straighten that out in about two weeks,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019ll take us two weeks, easier than D.C.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump's comments, Landry said on social media, \u201cWe will take President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s help from New Orleans to Shreveport!\u201d",
      "But city leaders immediately balked at the idea.",
      "\u201cCrime is down in New Orleans,\u201d City Councilmember Oliver Thomas, who is also a mayoral candidate, said via text message. \u201cThat would seem to be very political or a major overreaction!\u201d",

They can\u2019t solve crimes, they can\u2019t interview witnesses and they aren\u2019t trained to constitutionally police,\u201d Morrell said in a statement. \u201cNOPD is doing a great job with the existing resources they have.

      "Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly railed against Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for not requesting that the National Guard be deployed.",
      "\u201cWe could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago. If we don\u2019t have the support of some of these politicians, but I\u2019ll tell you who is supporting us, the people of Chicago,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Award-winning actor producer and writer Issa Rae is opening up about what inspired her new documentary, \"Seen and Heard: The History of Black Television.\" She's executive producer of the two-part series that explores the history of Black representation on TV and how Black artists and creators revolutionized the industry while confronting major challenges.",
      "The series, which Rae and her collaborators started creating in 2019, features media icons such as Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Tracee Ellis Ross, Norman Lear and Shonda Rhimes.",
      "\"What inspired me to even get my start was just seeing the people that I love, the people that I know, the people that raised me on TV, and that representation was so essential for me to recognize that I could do it,\" Rae told \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday about her inspiration growing up in the 90s.",
      "In the early 2000s, Rae said there was a \"disappearance all of the sudden\" of Black characters and shows on TV, but they reemerged about a decade later.",
      "In the 2010s, \"there were just so many new shows, new shows of color,\" she said. But now, Rae said TV and media is once again in an era where Black characters and shows have disappeared.",
      "\"I think the advent of cable made a huge difference where, you know, now these networks had to try to capture the broadest audience possible because they were losing audiences to different niche cable networks and so they were like, 'how can we maximize the audience we have?' and they have a tendency to go broad then, and broad sometimes just means White, the most eyeballs that you can get,\" she said.",
      "Even though shows like \"Family Matters\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" were universal and watched by a broad audience, there is sometimes a feeling that Black shows may exclude an audience, she said.",
      "The documentary also explores the importance of representation behind the camera.",
      "\"It makes such a difference when you're thinking about something as small as set design. I've seen that just even on my own productions and watching movies. Sometimes you'll watch a movie and you'll see a Black character's bedroom, and you'll be like 'they would never, what? They would never have that.'\"",
      "The details in a show could also apply to how a character dresses or their hair.",
      "\"I don't want to be taken out of a story. If I'm immersed, like those small details really, really matter, and there's just \u2014 also there's a different level of honestly, pride that goes in, in creating something that you know you're a part of and you understand on a different level,\" Rae said.",
      "She said the changing media industry is challenging, \"but it's another time that I'm confident we'll get through. There's so many opportunities in the digital era and that's where I came from. I find hope in knowing that I can create. If I want to tell a story I'm going to tell a story regardless.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 05:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

Please don't threaten to kill someone if something doesn't go your way \u2014 I promise you, it's not that serious,\" she told Teen Vogue.",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:40:22 -0400",
    "summary": "A master of figurative art is now focused on the work of other artists, gifting a collection of more than 100 paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
    "story": [
      "When Alex Katz began painting more than 75 years ago, he ignored what was popular then, to pursue his passion: figurative art. \"Most people didn't like my work,\" he said. \"It was figurative, and everyone was abstract, and everything was pop art. But a lotta people didn't like it.\"",
      "But he says he didn't care that much what they thought: \"If they liked it, swell. And if they didn't like it, go to hell.\"",
      "Katz depicts recognizable figures and objects from the real world. Using unfussy backgrounds and large areas of color, he emphasizes shapes and outlines, and paints massive pieces, often with his wife, Ada, as his subject. \"I did the figures on a flat ground,\" he said. \"I did the double portraits of Ada. I did the big heads before anyone. And that's really aggressive. And the big compositions. No one had done anything like it.\"",
      "Katz grew up in Queens, New York, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. He's been honing his technique ever since.",
      "In 1986, \"Sunday Morning\" documented his artistic process:",
      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. I want to go where I'm scared. And the new things might be better, they might be worse, but I have to do 'em.\"",

      "She chose September, that most excellent month, to make her move. The monsoon had receded, leaving Kerala gleaming like an emerald strip between the mountains and the sea. As the plane banked to land, and the earth rose to greet us, I couldn't believe that topography could cause such palpable, physical pain. I had never known that beloved landscape, never imagined it, never evoked it, without her being part of it. I couldn't think of those hills and trees, the green rivers, the shrinking, cemented-over rice fields with giant billboards rising out of them advertising awful wedding saris and even worse jewelry, without thinking of her. She was woven through it all, taller in my mind than any billboard, more perilous than any river in spate, more relentless than the rain, more present than the sea itself. How could this have happened? How? She checked out with no advance notice. Typically unpredictable.",
      "The church didn't want her. She didn't want the church. (There was savage history there, nothing to do with God.) So given her standing in our town, and given our town, we had to fashion a fitting funeral for her. The local papers reported her passing on their front pages, most national papers mentioned it, too. The internet lit up with an outpouring of love from generations of students who had studied in the school she founded, whose lives she had transformed, and from others who knew of the legendary legal battle she had waged and won for equal inheritance rights for Christian women in Kerala. The deluge of obituaries made it even more crucial that we do the right thing and send her on the way she deserved. But what was that right thing? Fortunately, on the day she died the school was closed and the children had gone home. The campus was ours. It was a huge relief. Perhaps she had planned that, too.",
      "Conversations about her death and its consequences for us, especially me, had begun when I was three years old. She was thirty then, debilitated by asthma, dead broke (her only asset was a bachelor's degree in education), and she had just walked out on her husband\u2014my father, I should say, although somehow that comes out sounding strange. She was almost eighty-nine when she died, so we had sixty years to discuss her imminent death and her latest will and testament, which, given her preoccupation with inheritance and wills, she rewrote almost every other week. The number of false alarms, close shaves, and great escapes that she racked up would have given Houdini pause for thought. They lulled us into a sort of catastrophe complacency. I truly believed she would outlive me. When she didn't, I was wrecked, heart-smashed. I am puzzled and more than a little ashamed by the intensity of my response.",

Our seventeenth-century lit class has only about thirty people, but Modern Furniture is held in an auditorium with cushioned seats set on a steep slope down to the professor at his podium. Behind him is a big screen that flashes pictures of Corbusier's B 306 chaise longue and Bauhaus nesting tables. I catch up on a lot of sleep in that class.",

      "I agree. What else can I do? I am a mere student, and he is a scholar. That much is clear right away. I've never met a scholar who wasn't a professor. And Sam isn't even a grad student. He's a senior, like me.",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy ousted every member of a CDC panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations earlier this year, in some cases replacing them with people who have questioned the safety of vaccines.",
      "And last week, the FDA only authorized a set of updated COVID-19 vaccines for younger adults and children with preexisting health conditions, in addition to all seniors.",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:56:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

    "story": [
      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids.\"",

      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",

      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",
      "As of Sept. 3, traders see a 95% probability that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",

Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year.

    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",

The lattes, made with \"protein-boosted milk,\" contain 27 to 36 grams of protein, according to Starbucks.",
      "The new menu items come as the company works to reignite sales after a revenue slowdown last year. Under CEO Brian Niccol, Starbucks has rolled out a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan to win back customers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-chrome-search-engine-data/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 19:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

      "Disney will pay $10 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that the entertainment company facilitated the \"unlawful collection\" of children's personal data.",
      "In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the FTC\u00a0said that Disney Worldwide Services and Disney Entertainment Operations \u2014 two entities that offer technical support and media content \u2014 violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, known as COPPA, by failing to properly label some videos uploaded to YouTube as \"made for kids.\" The mislabeling also exposed children to \"age-inappropriate YouTube features,\" the FTC said in a\u00a0statement.",

    "summary": "A digital token offered by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial has started trading. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",

    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",

      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",
      "Shares of the company rose slightly before the market opened.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:29:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The number of immigrant workers has declined from January through the end of July, preliminary Census data shows.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans gather Monday to celebrate Labor Day, federal data shows how President Trump's immigration policies are reshaping the U.S. workforce.",
      "The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has declined by 1.2 million from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That figure includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "The labor market shakeup comes as the flow of immigrants into the U.S. has slowed significantly under Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \"dangerous criminals,\" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.",
      "The overall number of people in the U.S. illegally peaked at an estimated 14 million in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center\u00a0estimate. However, the number of unauthorized immigrants has likely declined since then \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration,\" the authors of the Pew Research Center report said.",
      "In an Aug. 28 report, Oxford Economics projects the slowdown will persist through Mr. Trump's presidency, with net immigration falling to an annualized 500,000 by year-end and holding at that level until 2028.",
      "Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce, and data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.",
      "\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Kramer said. \"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"",
      "To be sure, the loss of immigrant workers reflects a small share of the overall U.S. labor force of more than 171 million workers. But the decline could affect states and sectors that are more dependent on foreign workers, economists say.",
      "Potential implications for the labor market",
      "Immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, as the majority tend to be ages 25 to 54, Oxford Economics noted. Economists call that demographic \"prime working age\" because they tend to be in their most productive decades of work.",
      "Immigrants are also more willing to migrate to states with higher labor demand.",
      "\"This is critical to ease shortages in regional labor markets, especially as U.S. labor mobility has steadily declined since the 1980s,\" Oxford Economics researchers noted.",
      "However, states with large shares of undocumented residents \u2014 namely Louisiana, Florida and New York \u2014 are starting to see some of the biggest declines in unauthorized migration, the report says.",
      "Experts say the drop in workforce participation could ripple through the labor market, which is already under some strain as employers pull back on hiring. The average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from an average of 123,000 from for the first four months of the year.",
      "\"The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\" said Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\"",
      "Immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S., according to Orrenius.",
      "The plunge in unauthorized immigration may also give the impression that the labor force is tighter than it actually is due to the higher ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, Oxford Economics said. That could muddy the picture of what's going on in the labor market, the authors say.",
      "\"The Fed is highly sensitive to the downside risks to the labor market, but the immigration reversal will continue to complicate the signals from the labor market data,\" they write.",
      "ICE raids take a toll on farms",
      "Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.",
      "Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.",
      "\"In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\" she said.",
      "In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).",
      "Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.",
      "Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.",
      "\"People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\" Tate said.",
      "Lidia, a farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.",
      "\"I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,\" said Lidia. \"I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\"",
      "Construction sites in and around McAllen also \"are completely dead,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "\"We have a large labor force that is undocumented,\" she said. \"We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\"",
      "Construction jobs",
      "The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.",
      "\"Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\" said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. \"But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.\"",
      "This may just be the tip of the iceberg: The Oxford report authors say that the increase in funding for immigration enforcement from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could eventually lead to an \"even higher sustained rate of deportations.\"",
      "Kramer, with Pew, warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.",
      "The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.",
      "\"What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\" De La Cruz said. \"What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has claimed the authority to bypass Congress and impose sweeping tariffs on foreign products, arguing the import duties are\u00a0necessary to strengthen the U.S. economy.",
      "Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.",
      "But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.",
      "\"This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a\u00a0Truth Social post, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.",
      "Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.",
      "How did the dispute arise?",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.",
      "The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 \u2014 or Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

      "According to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, the job-listings website, job postings have declined year over year by 6.7 percent. \"This is a tough year,\" she said. \"Younger job seekers, specifically those who are recent grads, are having a harder time finding work.\"",
      "Asked if there is a correlation between the rise in AI and the decline in jobs for recent graduates, Ullrich said, \"I think there is a cause-and-effect, but it's maybe not as significant as a lot of people would think. If you look specifically at tech jobs, job postings are down 36% compared to pre-pandemic numbers. But that decline started happening prior to AI becoming commonly used.\"",
      "Ullrich said in 2021-22, as the effects of the COVID pandemic began to ebb, there was a hiring boom in some sectors, including tech: \"Quite frankly, I think some companies overhired,\" she said.",
      "The uncertain national situation (tariffs, taxes, foreign policy) doesn't help, either. Ullrich said, \"Some other people have used the analogy of, like, driving through fog. If it's foggy, you slow down a bit. But if it's really foggy, you pull over. And unfortunately, some companies have pulled over to sit and wait to see what is gonna happen.\"",
      "That sounds a little more nuanced than some recent headlines, which make it pretty clear that AI is taking jobs:",

      "\"I read today an interview with a guy who said, you know, 'By 2027, we will be jobless, lonely, crime on the streets,'\" said David Autor, a labor economist at MIT. \"And I said, 'How do I take the other side of that bet?' 'Cause that's just not true. I'm sure of that. My view is, look, there is great potential and great risk. I think that it's not nearly as imminent on either direction as most people think.\"",
      "I said, \"But what it does seem to do is relieve the newcomers, the beginning, incoming novices we don't need anymore.\"",
      "\"This is really a concern,\" Autor said. \"Judgment, expertise, it's acquired slowly. It's a product of immersion, right? You know, how do I care for this patient, or land this plane, or remodel this building? And it's possible that we could strip out so much of the supporting work, that people never get the expertise. I don't think it's an insurmountable concern. But we shouldn't take for granted that it will solve itself.\"",
      "Let's cut to the chase. What are the jobs we're going to lose? Laura Ullrich said, \"We analyzed 2,800 specific skills, and 30% of them could be, at least partially, done by AI.\" (Which means, 70% of job skills are not currently at risk of AI.)",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/appeals-court-trump-tariffs-illegal/",
    "published": "Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:26:09 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "Convention attendance fell about 10% in June, then rose about 10% in July. Looking over a longer stretch, Hill said the meetings business is roughly flat and the next 16 months of bookings look especially strong.",
      "With social media griping about add-on costs, resorts are leaning into promotions.",
      "Recent examples include: Resorts World waiving resort fees and paid parking through Sept. 10, the Sahara Las Vegas Hotel offering free parking, late check-out and upgrades on select stays, Downtown Grand Hotel bundling dining credits, free slot play, no resort fee and The Strat touting \"Summer of Value\" rooms with taxes and fees included.",
      "The tourism agency is also pushing budget tips and free activities citywide.",
      "\"The idea that generally Las Vegas is not a value, that it is overpriced, I don't think our customers are doing math when they are concerned about a specific issue,\" Hill said. \"They're expressing concern about that specific topic, that tends to then move into a narrative around Las Vegas is expensive or Las Vegas is not a value, but if you actually do the math on that, that's not accurate.\"",
      "International travel remains mixed.",
      "Traffic from Canada is down about 18%, which Hill attributed in part to friction caused by politics and tariffs. By contrast, visits from Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia are rising, with more flights into Las Vegas.",
      "He also criticized a $250 U.S. visa fee for travelers from non-waiver countries, costs that can top $1,000 for a family of four, and long processing times that he said suppress demand.",
      "Despite the downward trend in overall visitors, Nevada gaming revenue remains resilient, a sign that visitors who do come are still spending.",
      "Nevada casinos kept $1.36 billion from gamblers in July, up 4% from a year earlier, according to data from state regulators.",
      "The Las Vegas Strip drove the increase with $749 million, a 5.6% gain. Downtown Las Vegas rose 3.6%.",

    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

    "story": [
      "The attorney general for the District of Columbia announced Thursday that the nation's capital is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops within the city's boundaries, alleging the violation amounts to an unconstitutional, \"involuntary military occupation.\"",
      "The suit alleges that President Trump \"has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy \u2014 that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.\"",
      "The lawsuit comes as President Trump has declared the use of national guard troops in DC a success, and voiced an interest in expanding his use of military assets to tackle crime in some of the nation's largest cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans.",
      "And, it comes on the heels of a similar legal challenge in California meant to blunt that effort. There, a federal judge earlier this week objected to the president's decision in June to deploy troops to Los Angeles, saying the move violated a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits the use of the military for domestic purposes. The White House has appealed.",
      "\"Deploying the National Guard to engage in law enforcement is not only unnecessary and unwanted, but it is also dangerous and harmful to the District and its residents,\" said D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb in a statement sent to CBS News.",
      "\"No American city should have the US military \u2014 particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement \u2014 policing its streets,\" Schwalb said. \"It's DC today but could be any other city tomorrow.\"",
      "Since mid-August, nearly 2,300 National Guard troops have joined the District's police force and an array of federal agencies in stepping up visible patrols around the city. The action has coincided with a noticeable impact on crime numbers. An analysis by CBS News found that crime was down by almost half during the first 19 days of troop deployments in comparison to the same dates the previous year.",
      "But the actions have come over vocal objections from District officials who said they are depriving them of local autonomy.",
      "\"More than 50 years ago, Congress granted the District the right to self-governance and control over local matters, including maintenance of public safety and order,\" Schwalb said in a statement. \"Congress did not give the President authority to participate in local D.C. law enforcement as he sees fit.\"",
      "The case, filed in federal court, echoes some aspects of the California legal challenge, arguing that law enforcement is not legally the domain of the military. It also argues that the D.C. National Guard troops deployed in the action fall under the command of city officials unless the president declares a genuine national emergency.",
      "Schwalb was elected to the attorney general post by District residents in 2022 and Axios reported this week that he would seek reelection in 2026. The lawsuit comes as the Washington Post reported that House Republicans are contemplating legislation to remove him\u00a0 and replace him with a presidential appointee.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the Supreme Court \"should not be imposing its own values on the American people,\" as the high court faces a longshot bid to revisit its decade-old landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.",
      "In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, Barrett told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell that she wants Americans to \"understand the law,\" which she said is \"not just an opinion poll\" based on the views of the court's nine justices.",
      "\"You know, what the court is trying to do is see what the American people have decided. And sometimes the American people have expressed themselves in the Constitution itself, which is our fundamental law. Sometimes in statutes,\" she said. \"But the court should not be imposing its own values on the American people. That's for the democratic process.\"",
      "Barrett spoke with O'Donnell ahead of the release of her book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" which hits shelves Sept. 9. At 53, she is the youngest member of the Supreme Court and could serve for decades. Barrett was appointed to the high court by President Trump during his first term, filling the seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until her death in September 2020, just weeks before the presidential election.",
      "Months after Barrett was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether to reverse Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned that ruling in June 2022, leaving decisions about abortion access to the states. Since then, more than 20 states have restricted access to the procedure.",
      "Barrett was in the five-justice majority that voted to overturn Roe, and the decision raised concerns from critics that other precedents grounded in the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause \u2014 namely those legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing the right to contraception \u2014 would be at risk of falling next.",
      "Bolstering those fears was a concurring opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, which no other justice joined, in which he said the Supreme Court should reconsider those decisions.",
      "But Justice Brett Kavanaugh also addressed precedents involving contraception and gay marriage in his own solo concurring opinion, writing that \"overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.\"",
      "Barrett wrote in her book \"the court has held that the rights to marry, engage in sexual intimacy, use birth control, and raise children are fundamental, but the rights to do business, commit suicide, and obtain abortion are not.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked to overturn its 2015 ruling that recognized the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges, in a case brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who stopped issuing marriage licenses on the heels of that decision 10 years ago.",
      "Davis's appeal faces long odds at the court. Whether to overturn Obergefell is one of three questions raised by Davis in her petition, and it's unclear whether there are four votes to reconsider the decision and five to overturn it.",
      "Still, some Democrats have suggested that the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, could dismantle the constitutional right to same-sex marriage.",
      "\"My prediction is they will do to gay marriage what they did to abortion \u2014 they will send it back to the states,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a podcast interview with Jessica Tarlov, a co-host on Fox News' \"The Five.\"",
      "Barrett, though, rebuffed Clinton's prediction.",
      "\"I think people who criticize the court or who are outside say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make in the book is that we have to tune those things out,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The new facility \u2014 which is located inside the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as Angola \u2014 is designed to house more than 400 detainees.",
    "story": [
      "A new immigration detention facility designed to house hundreds of undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes opened in Louisiana this week as part of what Attorney General Pam Bondi called a \"historic agreement\" between the state and federal government.",
      "The new facility \u2014 which is located inside the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as Angola \u2014 is designed to house more than 400 detainees.",
      "The facility was given the name Camp 57 after Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry being the 57th governor of the state. Federal officials have also dubbed Camp 57 as \"Louisiana Lockup.\" In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security described it as part of a \"new partnership\" between the Trump administration and the state of Louisiana.",
      "U.S. Immigrations Customs and Enforcement officials said that 51 detainees had already arrived at Camp 57 as of Tuesday.",
      "\"This is not just a typical ICE detention facility that you will see elsewhere in the country,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference Wednesday in front of Camp 57, alongside Bondi and Landry.",
      "She said some of the men who have already transferred there were convicted of serious crimes, including murder and rape.",
      "\"Louisiana is one of several states stepping up to solve these problems,\" Noem said.",
      "Noem also indicated that Angola's \"notorious\" history was one of the reasons that it was chosen for Camp 57.",
      "\"This is a facility that's notorious, it's a facility, Angola Prison is legendary \u2014 but that's a message that these individuals that are going to be here, that are illegal criminals, need to understand,\" Noem told reporters.",
      "During Wednesday's news conference, Landry said the facility is next to a lake \"full of alligators\" and surrounded by a \"forest full of bears.\" An officer with the Louisiana Department of Corrections told CBS News Wednesday there are alligators as big as 10 feet in the lake.",
      "Camp 57 has a chapel and law library, law enforcement officials familiar with the project told CBS News Wednesday.",
      "The facility, which will house only men, is separated from the rest of the Louisiana state prisoners incarcerated in the Angola complex, which spans 18,000 acres.",
      "Camp 57 was shuttered for many years before renovations started about a month ago. DHS officials said it was renovated into working order in about 30 days.",
      "Prior to its closure, Camp 57 had been used for disciplinary actions against state prisoners, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the project.",
      "Transferring ICE detainees between facilities isn't new but has increased under the current administration. A CBS News analysis of government data found that more than half of immigrants detained by ICE between Jan. 20, 2025, and July 29, 2025, were transferred to another facility two or more times \u2014 a greater share than during the Biden administration, the first Trump administration or the second Obama administration.",
      "Detainees are also getting shuffled further away during these transfers, CBS News found. Under the current administration, about 61% of detainees who started their stay were transferred more than 100 miles at least once. That's also a higher figure than in past administrations.",
      "Some immigration advocates are concerned this practice could make it more difficult for detainees to contact loved ones or their attorneys.",
      "Asked about the increase in detention transfers and how and when ICE determines someone should be transferred, Noem said Wednesday that \"this specific facility is going to host most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in the country, because it is so secure. Those individuals are being moved from other facilities around the country...because it is so secure behind these fences. I would say that we move people to other facilities for logistics, based on what country they're being repatriated from, where their flights are going, what we need to do to build deficiencies, and we will continue to do that as we need to in order to deport them out of the country and take them back home.\"",
      "Last month,\u00a0a federal judge ordered\u00a0that the Trump administration dismantle a state-run immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" DHS began moving detainees out of the facility last week.",
      "Regarding \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" Noem said Wednesday the White House will continue to appeal the judge's orders, because she believes the judge \"made the wrong decision.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 23:03:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court a lower court decision that found many of his tariffs are unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court late Wednesday to review a federal appeals court decision that found many of his tariffs are illegal, warning that the ruling threatens to \"unilaterally disarm the United States and allow other nations to hold America's economy hostage to their retaliatory trade policies.\"",
      "The appeal from the Justice Department was expected. Mr. Trump said this week that his administration would turn to the high court and ask it to speed up consideration of the case. The case has not yet been docketed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a 7-4 decision last Friday that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a federal emergency powers law, derailing a major component of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. But the appeals court said its ruling will not take effect until at least Oct. 14 to allow the Justice Department time to seek the Supreme Court's review.",
      "The administration wants the Supreme Court to decide whether a federal emergency powers law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, authorizes the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, and whether the law unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president.",
      "It could be weeks before the high court decides whether to weigh in on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs and, if it decides to do so, months before a decision is handed down.",
      "The president has warned that \"our country is going to suffer greatly\" if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court's decision on the tariffs.",
      "\"The stakes in this case could not be higher. The President and his Cabinet officials have determined that the tariffs are promoting peace and unprecedented economic prosperity, and that the denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses and thrust America back to the brink of economic catastrophe,\" the administration said in a filing. \"To the President and his most senior advisors, these tariffs thus present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation.\"",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote the Federal Circuit's ruling jeopardizes framework agreements that the Trump administration has negotiated with a handful of trading partners and puts ongoing talks at risk.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to expedite its review of the case. It proposed that the justices decide whether to take up the issue by next week, with all briefs due by late October and oral arguments in early November \u2014 an unusually fast timeline for the high court. The Justice Department included a statement from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that argued a quick resolution is necessary because the appeals court ruling \"gravely undermines the President's ability to conduct real-world diplomacy.\"",
      "Sauer indicated in the filing that the plaintiffs in the case agreed to the proposed schedule.",
      "Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel of the Liberty Justice Center, which is representing a group of small businesses that challenged the tariffs, said he is confident they will prevail before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival,\" he said in a statement Wednesday. \"We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients.\"",
      "The tariffs at issue in the case include those imposed by Mr. Trump through executive action taken in April that set a 10% baseline rate on nearly every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also involves a set of duties imposed on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "The Federal Circuit upheld a May ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade that found Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "But the levies are still in effect despite the Federal Circuit's decision, since it tossed out a permanent injunction issued by the trade court that universally blocked enforcement of the tariffs.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Federal Circuit said that the right to impose tariffs are a \"core congressional power.\" The majority said in other statutes delegating tariff power to the president, Congress has set \"specific substantive limitations and procedural guidelines\" to be followed when leaving those duties.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has used tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trading partners into negotiations, and said the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. He has announced frameworks of trade deals with countries like the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Wednesday's court filing argued that IEEPA gives the president \"broad discretion\" to regulate trade, including by imposing tariffs.",
      "\"There is nothing new or suspect about IEEPA's broad delegation of tariff authority to address national emergencies,\" Sauer wrote. \"Congress has long supplemented the President's Article II foreign-affairs powers by delegating capacious authority to impose tariffs that, in the President's judgment, will advance national security, foster economic prosperity, or facilitate negotiations with foreign counterparts.\"",

      "A source close to the White House confirmed to CBS News that senior officials have given their blessing to a potential Sununu campaign. The news was first reported by\u00a0NOTUS.",
      "New Hampshire has been a favorable state for Republicans running for governor in recent years, but is a more difficult challenge in Senate contests. No Republican has won a Senate race in the state since 2010. Recruiting viable challengers has proven to be a persistent concern on the Republican side, evidenced in part by the fact that John E. Sununu's younger brother \u2014 former GOP Gov. Chris Sununu \u2014 has been unwilling to run for federal office.",
      "Speaking to New Hampshire's\u00a0WMUR\u00a0on Tuesday, John E. Sununu said he will \"seriously consider a run\" and expects to make a decision by the end of next month.",
      "\"Over the past month, people from across New Hampshire have encouraged me to run for Senate. They feel it's a really important time for the state \u2014 that we need someone to represent us with our values, someone not bound to party lines, who's willing to take risks and get things done,\" Sununu said. \"I certainly agree, and I'm going to seriously consider a run. Over the next month, I'll travel across the state, talk to people, listen, and make sure we can build a strong team.\"",
      "Asked by WMUR whether he would seek an endorsement from President Trump, Sununu said he hopes to appeal broadly.",
      "\"I would want to win support, if I were to run, across the entire spectrum \u2014 and obviously that includes the president,\" Sununu said. \"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. If I decide to run, I imagine there will be primaries on both sides. But I'm excited about reaching out across the state, talking to people, and making the right decision for New Hampshire.\"",
      "If Sununu decides to run, he will need to face off in a GOP primary against Scott Brown, who\u00a0briefly represented Massachusetts\u00a0in the Senate before moving to New Hampshire in 2013. State Sen. Dan Innis is\u00a0also running\u00a0in next year's GOP Senate race.",
      "On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is running to replace Shaheen.",
      "Sununu served in the Senate for one term in the 2000s, before losing to then-former Gov. Shaheen in the 2008 cycle by around six percentage points in a rematch of their 2002 Senate contest.",
      "His family has a long history in New Hampshire GOP politics. His father, John H. Sununu,\u00a0served as governor\u00a0in the 1980s, before working as former President George H.W. Bush's chief of staff.",

      "Following his 2019 retirement from the Navy, Jackson was retroactively demoted after a yearslong investigation into his behavior. A report by the Pentagon's inspector general found that he made \"sexual and denigrating\" comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip, and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care. Jackson has\u00a0denied the allegations and claimed he was subject to a \"political hit job.\"",
      "Jackson\u00a0served in the White House Medical Unit\u00a0during the Bush, Obama and first Trump administrations. While he served as White House physician to both Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, Jackson garnered the most public attention for his statements about Mr. Trump's health during his first term.

    "summary": "The decision from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs is a massive victory for Harvard University.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration violated Harvard University's First Amendment rights and federal law when it froze nearly $2 billion in federal grants because of the Ivy League school's handling of antisemitism on campus.",
      "In a victory for Harvard, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs blocked Trump administration officials from implementing or instituting orders freezing the grant funding to Harvard and letters terminating research grants awarded by a slew of federal agencies.",
      "Burroughs wrote in her 84-page decision that Harvard has been \"plagued\" by antisemitism in recent years and should have done more to deal with the issue. But she found that there is \"little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and antisemitism.\"",
      "\"In fact, a review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI,\" Burroughs wrote. \"Further, their actions have jeopardized decades of research and the welfare of all those who could stand to benefit from that research, as well as reflect a disregard for the rights protected by the Constitution and federal statutes.\"",
      "The decision is a significant win for Harvard, which has been targeted by the Trump administration in recent months. The administration has sought to punish Harvard over what it says is its failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But it has also criticized the school's hiring and admissions practices.",
      "White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston told CBS News in a statement that the Trump administration will appeal the decision.",
      "\"Just as President Trump correctly predicted on the day of the hearing, this activist Obama-appointed judge was always going to rule in Harvard's favor, regardless of the facts,\" Huston said. \"To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years. Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future. We will immediately move to appeal this egregious decision, and we are confident we will ultimately prevail in our efforts to hold Harvard accountable.\"",
      "In a statement posted to the university's website Wednesday evening, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote that \"the ruling affirms Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the University's academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard leaders in April that contained a list of demands, and after the university rejected the terms, administration officials announced it had frozen more than $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard. The school later received letters from nine federal agencies canceling research grants.",
      "The Trump administration's cuts to federal funding to Harvard have continued, and Mr. Trump has also threatened to revoke the school's tax-exempt status.",
      "Harvard sued the Trump administration over the funding freeze in April, claiming the move was part of a \"pressure campaign\" by the White House to \"force Harvard to submit to the government's control over its academic programs,\" and views on anti-Israel speech on its campus. Both Harvard and the Justice Department asked Burroughs to go straight to a decision on the merits of the suit without a trial.",
      "In her ruling, Burroughs called the Trump administration's actions part of a \"government-initiated onslaught\" against the school that was \"much more about promoting a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First Amendment than about anything else, including fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "\"Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs to take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be,\" Burroughs wrote. \"Now it is the job of the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as required by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.\"",
      "Burroughs said that the Trump administration was right to investigate antisemitic behavior on Harvard's campus, but said that focus was not the \"true aim\" of the funding freeze. Instead, she agreed with Harvard that the administration retaliated against it in violation of its First Amendment rights.",
      "\"Harvard was wrong to tolerate hateful behavior for as long as it did,\" Burroughs wrote. \"The record here, however, does not reflect that fighting antisemitism was Defendants' true aim in acting against Harvard and, even if it were, combating antisemitism cannot be accomplished on the back of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Burroughs said that none of the letters the Trump administration sent to Harvard \"identified any specific instance of antisemitism on Harvard's campus, specified how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way that violated Title VI, or reflected any effort to follow the Title VI procedural requirements that govern the termination of federal funding.\"",
      "In addition to targeting Harvard's federal funding, the Trump administration has also taken aim at its ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the government over its efforts, and in June, Burroughs\u00a0blocked the Trump administration from revoking the university's ability to enroll foreign students. The Justice Department has appealed that decision.",

      "The strategy has drawn a litany of court challenges, many of which argue the U.S. isn't facing an \"invasion\" or migrants aren't receiving enough due process to contest their deportations. A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found many migrants sent to El Salvador didn't have criminal records.",
      "Tuesday's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit marks the latest court decision to push back on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling \u2014 which was issued by a three-judge panel, with one dissenter \u2014 found the situation with Tren de Aragua does not meet the definition of either an \"invasion\" or a \"predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued\u00a0that Tren de Aragua is engaged in an incursion because its members have perpetrated \"mass illegal migration.\" The appeals court rejected this argument.",
      "\"A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,\" the court said. \"There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.\"",
      "The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas. The court said the government can still remove the migrants under other legal authorities.",
      "American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who represents the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling \"an incredibly important win reigning in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration's attempt to use a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson argued Mr. Trump used the Alien Enemies Act lawfully.",
      "\"The authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President,\" Jackson said.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the ruling \"will not be the final say on the matter,\" and asserted: \"Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people.\"",
      "The ruling came in a case that has darted back and forth through the federal judiciary for months, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in the spring.",
      "The case was brought by migrants who were detained in Texas and sued to block their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The district court did not grant them relief, and the Fifth Circuit said they didn't have jurisdiction to intervene. But the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the migrants' removal in April, and a month later, the high court said the Fifth Circuit was wrong to dismiss the appeal and sent the case back to the appellate court for further review.",
      "The Supreme Court also said the government hadn't given the migrants enough notice of their impending deportations, after they said they were told just 24 hours in advance.",
      "Since then, the government has filed an updated notice that gave migrants seven days' warning of their deportation. The Fifth Circuit said that's likely enough time to satisfy the migrants' right to due process, but sent the issue back to the district court for further review.",
      "The ruling was penned by Judge Leslie Southwick, who was nominated by President George W. Bush. Biden-nominated Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez concurred with the part of the ruling that said there isn't an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion,\" but said seven days' notice isn't enough.",
      "Judge Andrew Oldham, whom Mr. Trump nominated during his first term, dissented.",
      "\"For 227 years, every President of every political party has enjoyed the same broad powers to repel threats to our Nation under the Alien Enemies Act ('AEA'). And from the dawn of our Nation until President Trump took office a second time, courts have never second-guessed the President's invocation of that Act. Not once,\" he wrote, arguing only the president can decide if the law applies. \"For President Trump, however, the rules are different.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is seeking to end temporary protections and work permits for nearly 270,000 Venezuelan migrants.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to terminate the legal status and work permits of nearly 270,000 Venezuelan migrants enrolled in the Temporary Protected Status program, urging them to self-deport from the U.S.",
      "The announcement marked the latest effort by the Trump administration to revoke humanitarian protections granted to hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries plagued by political turmoil, war and other crises, making them eligible for potential deportation.",
      "Unless blocked in court, the move by the Department of Homeland Security will terminate the legal protections of Venezuelans enrolled in a TPS program created in 2021 by the Biden administration. Homeland Security officials said roughly 268,000 Venezuelans are covered under the 2021 program, and their status would lapse in the next 60 days.",
      "Earlier in the year, the Trump administration, following a decision by the Supreme Court, terminated another TPS designation issued in 2023 that covered roughly 350,000 Venezuelans, most of whom crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally or entered the country legally under now-defunct Biden-era programs.",
      "The 2021 program covers a separate group of Venezuelan migrants who have been in the U.S. for longer.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem determined that keeping the 2021 program would not be in the best interest of the country, arguing that TPS incentivizes illegal immigration.",
      "\"Given Venezuela's substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration's efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,\" Tragesser added.",
      "Those who lose their TPS protections and don't have any other legal means to remain in the U.S. \u2014 such as applications for asylum or permanent American residency \u2014 could face arrest and deportation by federal immigration officials.",
      "Homeland Security officials on Wednesday said TPS recipients whose status expires should sign up for self-deportation using a government smartphone app, called CBP Home, that the Trump administration has repurposed to facilitate voluntary returns. Officials have offered self-deportees a $1,000 bonus if they return to their home countries.",
      "Created in 1990 by Congress as a way to provide a temporary safe haven to migrants from countries beset by armed conflict, environmental disasters or other emergencies, TPS has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It has argued the policy has been abused by Democratic administrations and unnecessarily extended for far too long, despite its temporary nature.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has also announced the termination of TPS programs for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "In lawsuits challenging the administration's actions, advocates have argued the native countries of many TPS recipients remain unstable and dangerous, and that the terminations are rooted in racial animus.",

      "Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday the federal government has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago, one day after President Trump again suggested he will send federal forces to the nation's third-largest city \u2014 drawing criticism from local leaders.",
      "The president had told reporters\u00a0Tuesday that \"we're going in\" to Chicago, but \"I didn't say when.\" The comments came weeks after Mr. Trump deployed Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., as part of a controversial anti-crime push, and suggested during that time that Chicago could be next.",
      "Asked by reporters for details on a possible Guard deployment in Chicago, Vance deferred to Mr. Trump on Wednesday, before saying: \"There are no immediate plans, but the president has said he has the legal authority to protect American citizens, whether that's in Chicago or in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Vance said the Trump administration hopes to work with Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, echoing the president, who said Tuesday he wants Pritzker to request that military forces be sent to Chicago to quell violent crime.",
      "Pritzker called the president's comments \"unhinged\" and vowed to take legal action against any potential military deployment. He argued that there isn't an emergency that would justify sending troops to Chicago, citing city statistics that show violent crime is on the decline.",
      "According to Department of Homeland Security sources, the Trump administration is also planning a major expansion of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago as early as this week, CBS News has reported.",
      "If Guard forces are sent to Chicago, it could become the third major U.S. city to face a military deployment under Mr. Trump's orders. Other cities could follow: Mr. Trump suggested Tuesday he's also planning to take action in Baltimore, and he said Wednesday he's weighing a deployment in New Orleans.",
      "Thousands of California National Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles starting in June, part of a mission to protect federal immigration agents and property from what Mr. Trump described as out-of-control, violent protests. And last month, the president sent members of the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement agents to the streets of the nation's capital.",
      "The potential move could draw legal challenges in Chicago. California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration over the Los Angeles deployment, arguing the federal government didn't have the legal right to take control of the state's Guard forces and alleging the troops were unlawfully engaged in law enforcement.",
      "An appellate court allowed Mr. Trump to keep Guard forces in Los Angeles, deferring to Mr. Trump. But a district court judge found Tuesday that the deployment violated a 19th-century law that prohibits the military from being used for law enforcement.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:27:25 -0400",
    "summary": "Florida and other states have required several vaccines for kids attending school for decades. They protect against diseases like measles, polio, chickenpox and hepatitis B.",
    "story": [
      "Governor Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced that Florida will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates in the state, making it the first in the nation to do so. Vaccines protecting against once-common and sometimes deadly childhood diseases like polio and measles have long been required for children at schools across the U.S.",
      "DeSantis also announced on Wednesday the creation of a state-level \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission modeled after similar initiatives pushed at the federal level by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The vaccine announcement, which Ladapo said would allow people to make their own decisions, drew criticism from physician groups and other health leaders who stress that the vaccines are safe and the most effective way to stop the spread of communicable diseases, especially among schoolchildren.",
      "\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"",
      "Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department in Texas, described the idea of dropping school vaccine requirements as \"insane and stupid.\"",
      "\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"",
      "He noted it was similar for measles, which caused 48,000 hospitalizations and 450 to 500 deaths each year before the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. Earlier this year, lower vaccination rates in some communities enabled the spread of the biggest measles outbreak in decades.",
      "\"it's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Huang said.",
      "Ladapo likened vaccine mandates to \"slavery\"",
      "Ladapo, who has frequently\u00a0clashed with the medical establishment, cast current vaccine requirements in schools and elsewhere as an \"immoral\" intrusion on people's rights bordering on \"slavery,\" and said they hamper parents' ability to make health decisions for their children.",
      "\"People have a right to make their own decisions, informed decisions,\" Ladapo said at a news conference in Valrico, Florida, in the Tampa area. \"They don't have the right to tell you what to put in your body. Take it away from them.\"",
      "The state Health Department, Ladapo said, can scrap its own rules for some vaccine mandates, but others would require action by the Florida Legislature. He did not specify any particular vaccines but repeated several times the effort would end \"all of them. Every last one of them.\"",
      "Florida would be the first state to eliminate so many vaccine mandates, Ladapo added.",
      "Ladapo said his department will work with lawmakers to make it happen. But the idea received immediate pushback from some officials.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who is running for Orlando mayor, said in a social media post that scrapping vaccines \"is reckless and dangerous\" and could cause outbreaks of preventable disease.",
      "\"This is a public health disaster in the making for the Sunshine State,\" she said on the social platform X.",
      "A prominent expert in the field, Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, said the Florida proposal \"flies in the face of a mountain of evidence that clearly shows the benefits of vaccinating kids before they enter school, and it will make the state less safe to visit or live in.\u00a0 Every parent of a child who dies or who is hospitalized with a vaccine-preventable disease will know exactly why.\"",
      "Florida has required vaccines for kids attending school for decades",
      "In Florida, vaccine mandates for child day care facilities and public schools include shots for measles, chickenpox, hepatitis B, Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio and other diseases, according to the state Health Department's website.",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida resisted imposing COVID vaccines on schoolchildren, requiring \"passports\" for places that draw crowds, school closures and mandates that workers get the shots to keep their jobs.",
      "\"I don't think there's another state that's done as much as Florida. We want to stay ahead of the curve,\" the governor said.",
      "The state \"MAHA\" commission would look into such things as allowing informed consent in medical matters, promoting safe and nutritious food, boosting parental rights regarding medical decisions about their children, and eliminating \"medical orthodoxy that is not supported by the data,\" DeSantis said. The commission will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.",
      "\"We're getting government out of the way, getting government out of your lives,\" Collins said.",
      "The commission's work will help inform a large \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the Legislature next session, which would address the vaccine mandates required by state law and make permanent the recent state COVID decisions relaxing restrictions, DeSantis said.",

      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",

      "Parnell said the Defense Department attorneys would help with the backlog of cases \"by presiding over immigration hearings.\" The Associated Press first reported the Pentagon's plans.",
      "The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases. But the plan to turn possibly hundreds of military lawyers into immigration judges comes after the Trump administration has fired more than two dozen immigration judges nationwide so far this year. Unlike federal district court judges, immigration judges work for the Justice Department.",
      "Judge Advocate General Corps officers are tasked with providing legal support to service members and their families or advising commanders on the legalities of warfare. The defense lawyers would likely need to undergo some training in immigration law, procedure and policy.",
      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department \"no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.\"",
      "Previously, only Justice Department lawyers with a decade of immigration law experience or former immigration judges could fill those roles.",
      "The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan in a statement after the new rule was published.",
      "\"While DoD attorneys may be well suited to handle military matters, immigration law is entirely different and exceptionally complex,\" AILA said. \"It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.\"",
      "\"The work of immigration judges has been described as life and death decisions in traffic court conditions,\" the statement continued. \"Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system.\"",
      "The group called on Congress to use its oversight powers \"to defend the rule of law and protect the independence of the immigration judiciary.\"",

He said in May that his office had submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that would activate the nine Florida National Guard members who are Judge Advocate General Corps officers to serve as immigration judges, which legal experts told CBS News is unprecedented.",
      "Typically, when National Guard troops help after a hurricane or secure a protest site, they remain under the command of their state governor, under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Under DeSantis' plan, the state would relinquish control of these officers to Washington. Title 10 would snap into place, reassigning the JAG officers under the command of the president and defense secretary. This grants them eligibility to serve as federal immigration judges, appointed by the U.S. attorney general.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:02:47 -0400",
    "summary": "One former federal prosecutor said of the indictment denials by D.C. grand juries that he's \"never heard of this happening.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 What was happening in the criminal case of Nathalie Rose Jones, who was facing charges in Washington, D.C., federal court this summer, wasn't typical.",
      "A grand jury of D.C. citizens on Tuesday had denied the Justice Department's request to indict Jones, who was accused of a federal crime for allegedly posting an Instagram threat against President Trump.",
      "In the nearly empty, dimly lit courtroom, Judge Moxila Upadhyaya listened to arguments from attorneys for nearly 15 minutes and surveyed the case file before her. She paused, looked up at the federal prosecutor standing 10 feet away and asked what the Justice Department planned to do next in the case.",
      "The prosecutor had no answer but said he'd have a response \"as soon as possible,\" maybe within a few days.",
      "This grand jury's rejection of the Justice Department's request for an indictment was one of at least four such instances in the past week in which a grand jury denied an indictment in the District of Columbia.",
      "\"Not only have I never heard of this happening, I've never heard of a prosecutor who's heard of this happening,\" said former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for in D.C. until January 2025.",
      "\"This is not the fault of career prosecutors, but rather the office's failure\u2014again and again\u2014to secure indictments suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors,\" Ballou told CBS News.",
      "Another former federal prosecutor, Victor Salgado, said, \"It is exceptionally rare for federal grand juries to reject proposed charges, given the low evidentiary bar for indictment and the Justice Department's policy of pursuing cases only when there is sufficient evidence to both secure and sustain a conviction.\"",
      "Jones is accused of posting on Instagram in early August, \"I am willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea with Liz Cheney and all The Affirmation present.\"",
      "According to the Justice Department, on Aug. 15, the U.S. Secret Service conducted a voluntary interview with Jones, during which she stated the president was a \"terrorist\" and a \"Nazi.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said, \"A Washington D.C. grand jury refused to indict someone who threatened to kill the President of the United States. Her intent was clear, traveling through five states to do so. She even confirmed the same to the US Secret Service. This is the essence of a politicized jury. The system here is broken on many levels. Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin.\"",
      "Jones was briefly held in pretrial detention in the case last month but was released ahead of Tuesday's hearing. She appeared by Zoom at the hearing in Upadhyaya's courtroom and listened as a prosecutor told the judge that the feds have not decided whether to return to the grand jury for a second time to seek an indictment.",
      "Her attorney argued in a court filing this week that Jones possessed no firearms and \"she repeatedly told them she had no intent to harm anyone, including the president, and was in D.C., to attend a peaceful protest.\"",
      "In a separate case, multiple people familiar with the decision said a grand jury refused a Justice Department request to indict Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in August. Dunn is a former Justice Department employee who was fired after news circulated of his arrest in the sandwich case. The Justice Department has instead filed a new misdemeanor count against Dunn, which does not require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Court records reviewed by CBS News said a D.C. grand jury also rejected a Justice Department request to indict Sydney Reid, who was arrested in July for allegedly attempting to interfere with the transfer of an alleged gang member into immigration custody.",
      "\"As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the (officers) pushed her against the wall and told her to stop,\" the Justice Department alleged in a complaint. \"Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer.\"",
      "The Justice Department acknowledged in a court filing on Aug. 25 in Reid's case that \"[a]n Indictment has not been returned.\"",
      "Last week, a D.C. grand jury also declined to indict Alvin Summers, who was accused of swinging his arms at a U.S. Park Police officer after a foot chase on Aug. 15. Prosecutors alleged Summers \"grabbed\" the officer with force, and charged him with assaulting and resisting an officer.",
      "Shortly after the grand jury rejected the case, a defense attorney for Summers filed a motion in court, which argued, \"Mr. Summers should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest. The charges against Mr. Summers were based on an allegation made by one officer who was wearing a body-worn camera. That officer's testimony was rejected by the grand jury, presumably after reviewing the body-worn camera video.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss Summers's case on Aug. 29.",
      "The trajectory of Jones' case was less clear after Tuesday's hearing. Upadhyaya scheduled a hearing for Monday, but declined Jones' request to loosen the restrictions governing her release from pretrial detention.",
      "The reasons these D.C. grand juries have not handed up indictments in these cases are not known, but Salgado suggested it might be possible that in each of these cases \"that they disagreed with the Justice Department's theory of prosecution.\"",
      "\"It is not difficult to imagine 12 D.C. jurors concluding that throwing a sandwich at a federal officer \u2014 while clearly objectionable and potentially unlawful \u2014 does not amount to felony assault,\" Salgado said. \"At its core, the federal grand jury functions as a vital constitutional safeguard and a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\"",

    "summary": "The United States will continue to conduct strikes on \"narco-terrorists\" in the Caribbean, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said.",
    "story": [
      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region. Nicolas Maduro, as he considers whether to be a narco-trafficker, has decisions to make.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump suggested he's planning to send National Guard troops to Chicago, in what could be the latest salvo in his controversial push to use federal forces to address crime.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Tuesday he's planning to send National Guard troops to Chicago, in what could be the latest salvo in his controversial push to use federal forces to address crime, drawing pushback from local political leaders.",
      "\"We're going in. I didn't say when, we're going in,\" Mr. Trump said in an Oval Office event, after a reporter asked if he plans to send the Guard to Chicago.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify whether his administration will primarily send Guard forces or federal law enforcement agents to Chicago. He also didn't say how many Guard troops could be deployed, or where they will hail from.",
      "On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" that Pritzker should be \"welcoming support and outside efforts to come alongside him, just as the mayor of Washington mostly has.\"",
      "Hegseth added that he and the Joint Chiefs chairman both served in the National Guard and are \"happy to support in every way the president's belief that we should be helping to secure American cities where Americans deserve to live safely.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0also suggested Baltimore could also draw a federal response.",
      "The president has vowed for weeks to intervene in Chicago and Baltimore, arguing the two cities have failed to contain violent crime. Chicago could be the third city to face a crackdown under the Trump administration: Thousands of Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed to the streets of Washington, D.C., since last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, and Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles in June to protect immigration agents.",
      "Mr. Trump said he hopes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u2014 a vociferous Trump critic \u2014 will call him and request that troops be sent to Chicago. But the president said: \"We're going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country.\"",
      "In a press conference Tuesday, Pritzker called Mr. Trump's comments \"unhinged.\"",
      "\"No, I will not call the president asking him to send troops to Chicago,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said he expects federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies to surge in Chicago in the coming days. He said the president could then \"use any excuse\" to deploy military personnel.",
      "The governor said his administration is \"ready to fight troop deployments in court.\"",
      "Any Guard deployment to Chicago would likely draw legal pushback.",
      "The D.C. National Guard is controlled by the president, but the 50 states' Guard forces are typically run by governors. Mr. Trump called members of the California National Guard into federal service without Gov. Gavin Newsom's permission by invoking a law that applies to rebellions or situations where the president can't enforce the law with \"regular forces.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration over the move. An appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump likely had the right to call up the California National Guard, but a lower court judge on Tuesday ruled the deployment violated a 19th century law prohibiting the military from being used for domestic law enforcement.",
      "Trump calls Chicago a \"mess\" \u2014 Pritzker calls his claims \"absurd\"",
      "The president has zeroed in on cracking down on crime in the nation's major cities, beginning with the effort in D.C. \u2014 despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the crackdown in the nation's capital, he said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities. Since then, he has publicly lashed out over Chicago's murder rate.",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said last month. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",
      "The president later praised the National Guard's work with the police in D.C., saying, \"After we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe, also.\"",
      "\"Chicago's a mess, you have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent,\" Mr. Trump said last month. \"And we'll straighten that one out, probably next \u2013 that will be our next one after this.\"",
      "The president predicted that, within a week of a federal intervention in Chicago, \"We will have no crime in Chicago just like we have no crime in D.C.\"",
      "In Tuesday's press conference, Pritzker said \"there is no emergency that warrants deployment of troops.\" He called Mr. Trump's characterization of crime in Chicago \"absurd\" and pointed to recent reductions in homicides, shootings and other violent crimes according to city statistics.",
      "\"One violent crime is too many, and we have more work to do,\" Pritzker said. \"But we have made important progress on safety that Trump is now jeopardizing.\"",

    "summary": "Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Nikole  Killion\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump has touted himself as a Nobel-worthy peacemaker. Here's what some foreign policy analysts say about the disputes he cites.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a\u00a0peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to\u00a0broker a deal between the countries and\u00a0suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate\u00a0a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterward.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

    "summary": "\"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered,\" the project's leader said.",
    "story": [
      "A dinosaur dubbed one of the \"strangest\" ever found boasted an elaborate armory of long bony spikes and a tail weapon, according to findings published in the science journal Nature.",
      "Spicomellus, which roamed the Earth 165 million years ago, is the world's oldest ankylosaur, a herbivorous group of dinosaurs known for their tank-like bodies.",
      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",
      "Butler called the fossils an \"incredibly significant discovery,\" adding that \"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered.\"",
      "Butler's project co-leader, Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum in London, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said.

    "summary": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke to CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the Supreme Court \"should not be imposing its own values on the American people,\" as the high court faces a longshot bid to revisit its decade-old landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.",
      "In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, Barrett told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell that she wants Americans to \"understand the law,\" which she said is \"not just an opinion poll\" based on the views of the court's nine justices.",
      "\"You know, what the court is trying to do is see what the American people have decided. And sometimes the American people have expressed themselves in the Constitution itself, which is our fundamental law. Sometimes in statutes,\" she said. \"But the court should not be imposing its own values on the American people. That's for the democratic process.\"",
      "Barrett spoke with O'Donnell ahead of the release of her book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" which hits shelves Sept. 9. At 53, she is the youngest member of the Supreme Court and could serve for decades. Barrett was appointed to the high court by President Trump during his first term, filling the seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until her death in September 2020, just weeks before the presidential election.",
      "Months after Barrett was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether to reverse Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned that ruling in June 2022, leaving decisions about abortion access to the states. Since then, more than 20 states have restricted access to the procedure.",
      "Barrett was in the five-justice majority that voted to overturn Roe, and the decision raised concerns from critics that other precedents grounded in the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause \u2014 namely those legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing the right to contraception \u2014 would be at risk of falling next.",
      "Bolstering those fears was a concurring opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, which no other justice joined, in which he said the Supreme Court should reconsider those decisions.",
      "But Justice Brett Kavanaugh also addressed precedents involving contraception and gay marriage in his own solo concurring opinion, writing that \"overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.\"",
      "Barrett wrote in her book \"the court has held that the rights to marry, engage in sexual intimacy, use birth control, and raise children are fundamental, but the rights to do business, commit suicide, and obtain abortion are not.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked to overturn its 2015 ruling that recognized the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges, in a case brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who stopped issuing marriage licenses on the heels of that decision 10 years ago.",
      "Davis's appeal faces long odds at the court. Whether to overturn Obergefell is one of three questions raised by Davis in her petition, and it's unclear whether there are four votes to reconsider the decision and five to overturn it.",
      "Still, some Democrats have suggested that the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, could dismantle the constitutional right to same-sex marriage.",
      "\"My prediction is they will do to gay marriage what they did to abortion \u2014 they will send it back to the states,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a podcast interview with Jessica Tarlov, a co-host on Fox News' \"The Five.\"",
      "Barrett, though, rebuffed Clinton's prediction.",
      "\"I think people who criticize the court or who are outside say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make in the book is that we have to tune those things out,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Two tourists fell to their deaths this week near a glacier in southeastern Alaska, in separate fatal incidents, authorities said.",
      "Thomas Casey, 69, was last seen early Saturday, Alaska Wildlife Troopers said in a dispatch. The Arizona resident was hiking in the area around Juneau, Alaska's capital city, and had not returned by the following morning as planned. Casey did not share a travel itinerary before setting out on the hike, according to the dispatch, but his phone pinged at a remote location between the Thunder Mountain and Nugget Creek trails that surround the Mendenhall Glacier.",
      "Juneau Mountain Rescue and multiple crews of search dogs surveyed the trails and the area around the site of the ping, state troopers said. They found Casey's remains on the west side of the glacier late Monday afternoon and determined that he had suffered injuries in a fall. The hiker's body was sent to the state medical examiner's office, according to the troopers' dispatch.",
      "Later, on Tuesday, wildlife troopers received a report of a missing man who had fallen into a stream on the Mendenhall Glacier, according to another dispatch. Troopers have not identified the man by name but said he was a resident of Italy.",
      "After falling into the stream, the Italian man was pushed by the force of the water into a small opening in the ice measuring roughly 2 feet wide, the wildlife troopers said. Two others traveling with the man told troopers they could no longer see him once he fell through the hole.",
      "A technical ice rescue team was deployed to the area and, once they arrived, discovered the hole was filled with rushing water. Troopers said the situation \"was determined to be too dangerous to attempt to locate the missing man, pending any further leads.\"",
      "Efforts to notify the man's next of kin were ongoing as of Wednesday, they said. CBS News has reached out to Alaska Wildlife Troopers for more information.",
      "The Mendenhall Glacier runs for about 13 miles, from an ice field not far from Juneau into a lake at its base. Its close proximity to Juneau, and its accessibility by road, contribute to the glacier's popularity as a tourist destination, local guides say.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",
      "As of Sept. 3, traders see a 95% probability that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department \"no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.\"",
      "Previously, only Justice Department lawyers with a decade of immigration law experience or former immigration judges could fill those roles.",
      "The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan in a statement after the new rule was published.",
      "\"While DoD attorneys may be well suited to handle military matters, immigration law is entirely different and exceptionally complex,\" AILA said. \"It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.\"",
      "\"The work of immigration judges has been described as life and death decisions in traffic court conditions,\" the statement continued. \"Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system.\"",
      "The group called on Congress to use its oversight powers \"to defend the rule of law and protect the independence of the immigration judiciary.\"",
      "In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has already proposed loaning National Guard troops to the federal government for use as immigration judges. He said in May that his office had submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that would activate the nine Florida National Guard members who are Judge Advocate General Corps officers to serve as immigration judges, which legal experts told CBS News is unprecedented.",
      "Typically, when National Guard troops help after a hurricane or secure a protest site, they remain under the command of their state governor, under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Under DeSantis' plan, the state would relinquish control of these officers to Washington. Title 10 would snap into place, reassigning the JAG officers under the command of the president and defense secretary. This grants them eligibility to serve as federal immigration judges, appointed by the U.S. attorney general.",
      "The Justice Department will pick up the tab for the operation if adopted. It plans to train the officers over six weeks \u2014 a crash course in immigration law, procedure and policy. Each officer would need to pass a written exam before donning the judge's robe.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:27:01 -0400",
    "summary": "A new survey predicts Americans will spend $1,552 per person on average, 5% less than they did in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year. Since 2019, holiday sales during the months of November and December have accounted for 19% of total retail revenue for the year, according to a National Retail Federation\u00a0report.",
      "Tariffs, high prices top of mind",
      "The projected pullback in consumer holiday spending underscores Americans' shaky confidence in the state of the economy. Worries over inflation and tariffs have already led shoppers to be more judicious with their spending.",
      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",
      "Tighter spending",
      "PwC expects consumers to approach holiday shopping \"more deliberately,\" with an eye toward saving money, amid ongoing concerns over tariffs and high prices.",
      "Furman said the potential for tariff-related price increases has already made the consumers \"very conscious of trying to buy things at a discount.\"Case in point: Internet searches for \"discount\" and \"coupon code\" have climbed by 11% over the past year, according to the survey.",
      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",
      "\"If you're interested in very hot items, knowing that they're going to likely be on shelves sooner, to guarantee that you'll get them, you may want to shop for them in those early promotional cycles, versus wait until the five-day frenzy,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region.

    "summary": "Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Nikole  Killion\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Some rescue workers have walked for miles to reach the affected areas.",
      "Some emergency crews have been flown in by helicopter, but in some affected villages, the rough terrain makes it impossible for helicopters to land, and the Taliban's Minister of Defense said it was sending commandos down by rope to help people.",

      "The earthquake struck mountainous and remote parts of Afghanistan, and there have been significant aftershocks, driving many families to sleep out in the open and far from their homes, most of which were not built to withstand earthquakes despite the region being prone to seismic activity.",
      "The disaster struck as Afghanistan was already struggling through a humanitarian crisis.",

      "The Taliban's official spokesman shared several bank account numbers seeking private donations, saying any funds would go to help those in need.

      "The Elevador da Gloria operates in the same manner as hillside funiculars all over Europe and elsewhere, with two cars attached at opposing ends of a circular cable \u2014   as one car goes up, the other goes down. The Lisbon funicular is powered by motors in each car, which run on electricity delivered via separate overhead cables.",

    "story": [
      "China's President Xi Jinping and his visiting Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin discussed life-prolonging organ transplants and immortality as they chatted before a massive military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, in comments picked up by state media microphones.",
      "Historic images showed Xi shaking hands and speaking with Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they walked down a red carpet by Tiananmen Square, in scenes viewed as a challenge to President Trump and the U.S.-led global order that has prevailed for more than a century.",
      "\"These days ... 70 years old,\" Xi mused in Mandarin as he walked beside Putin and Kim, according to video aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi's translator conveyed the remarks to Putin, who is then heard in Russian quoting a line from a Tang dynasty poem: \"In the past, it used to be rare for someone to be older than 70 and these days they say that at 70 one's still a child.\"",
      "Putin then turned toward Xi, speaking while gesturing with his hands, though his words are inaudible on the CCTV feed. The same Chinese translator then relays Putin's remarks to Xi.",
      "\"With the ... development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, people could get younger as they grow older, and may even become immortal,\" Putin said, according to the translator.",
      "Xi then spoke again in Mandarin as the camera cut away: \"Predictions are, in this century, it may be ... possible to live to 150 years old.\"",
      "Putin confirmed the exchange during a news conference later Wednesday.",
      "\"Ah, I think it was when we were going to the parade that the chairman spoke about this,\" he told reporters, referring to Xi.",
      "\"Modern means \u2014 both health improvement and medical means, and then even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement \u2014 allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\" Putin added.",
      "Xi and Putin, along with Kim and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world this week was clearly calculated.",
      "The parade was the first time Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 providing him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "China and Russia have declared a \"no limits partnership,\" and neither Xi nor Putin, who are both 72, has ever expressed any intention of stepping down from their respective roles at the helm of their nations.",
      "While Xi's predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao relinquished power after 10 years in office, he abolished term limits in 2018 and, in 2023, was handed a third term as Chinese president.",
      "Putin was elected to a record fifth six-year term just last year in Russia. Critics dismissed the vote as a patently undemocratic farse, as virtually all of Putin's serious political opponents were barred from running, and many of them were jailed.",
      "Putin has twice used his leverage as Russia's autocratic leader to amend the constitution so that he can theoretically stay in power until he's in his mid-80s. He already is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.",
      "China, meanwhile, has historically had one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the world, with a severe shortage of organ donors and a long-standing black-market organ trade. In 2016, about four years into Xi's tenure as leader, surgeons from the World Health Organization gathered in Beijing to try to allay skepticism about whether Chinese hospitals had, as claimed, stopped performing transplants with the organs of executed prisoners.",

      "President Trump told CBS News on Wednesday that he remains committed to pursuing a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, despite mounting uncertainty over the prospect of face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump characterized his position as both realistic and optimistic, and said he is closely monitoring how both leaders are handling this crossroads in the negotiations.",
      "\"I've been watching it, I've been seeing it, and I've been talking about it with President Putin and President Zelenskyy,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview. \"Something is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done.\"",
      "The president's comments come as Russia continues to strike Ukraine. Late last month, Russia carried out a massive drone and missile attack against Ukraine's capital, killing at least 15 people, including four children, according to a city official.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is unhappy with the carnage but will keep pushing for a peace agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to get it all straightened out,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, the Russia one, I thought, would have been on the easier side of the ones I've stopped, but it seems to be something that's a little bit more difficult than some of the others,\" he said.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was watching as Putin joined the leaders of China and North Korea for a grand military parade in Beijing.",
      "\"I understand the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching, and I was watching,\" Mr. Trump said. \"My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also told CBS News on Wednesday that his approach to many diplomatic negotiations, be it with Russia and Ukraine or with other warring nations, is to bring together key leaders into a room and have them broker an agreement in real time, often with his guidance on the transaction \u2014 and to not write off any possibility before that happens.",
      "That approach, he said, demands patience, even when a quick resolution is sought, but he believes it has paid off in other peace agreements this year.",
      "When asked whether he sometimes must \"wait things out,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"Well, you have to do that.\"",
      "\"We've had some very good days, fortunately, and once I get them in a room together, or get them at least speaking together, they seem to work out. We've saved millions of lives.\"",
      "Last month, ahead of his closely watched meeting with Putin in Alaska, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"All I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\"",
      "Beyond the Russia-Ukraine war, Mr. Trump has claimed in recent weeks that he should be credited for ending six or seven wars during this term and that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. White House officials have pointed to a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "Some foreign policy analysts have criticized Mr. Trump's claim, saying that many of those conflicts remain unresolved or were not full-scale wars. Or they contended that Mr. Trump was not a central force in the discussions.",
      "Several Trump allies have told CBS News that Mr. Trump maintains that the work done by him and his administration has been crucial in furthering those negotiations.",
      "\"A lot of times, they're fighting each other for so long,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News. \"They're fighting each other so long, they don't even think in terms of peace. It just becomes a way of life. And when I get them together, I get the people in the room, I'm able to convince them. 'Let's go. Let's make peace. It's enough, already. You've lost enough lives.'\"",

    "story": [
      "An Argentine federal court announced Wednesday that authorities had recovered the long-lost \"Portrait of a Lady,\" an 18th-century work by the Italian painter Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis in World War II and rediscovered when it appeared in an online real estate listing last month.",
      "Before the presentation of the giant gold-framed portrait on Wednesday in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata, the painting had not been seen publicly in 80 years.",
      "The first-ever color photo of the portrait surfaced in a real estate listing unwittingly posted by one of the daughters of Friedrich Kadgien, the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing the painting from one of Europe's most prominent prewar art dealers and collectors.",
      "\"We're doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\" federal prosecutor Daniel Adler said during a press conference to display the full-length portrait of Countess Colleoni, her hair ink-black and dress embroidered with pastel flowers.",
      "\"It was people from the community, specifically journalists, who prompted the investigation,\" Adler said.",
      "Dutch journalists made the shocking discovery while investigating Kadgien's past in Argentina, where the high-ranking official fled after the collapse of the Third Reich, and later died in 1978.",
      "News of the find thrilled historians the world over and eventually reached the heirs of the painting's original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. He died in a shipwreck after fleeing Amsterdam ahead of advancing German troops in May 1940.",
      "His descendants have sought to recover an estimated 1,100 paintings missing since the forced sale of Goudstikker's extensive inventory to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, Hermann G\u00f6ring, who built up a major art collection during WWII.",
      "The sudden reappearance of \"Portrait of a Lady\" last week was fleeting. Within hours of the story's publication in Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad last Monday, the real estate listing was taken down. Police raided the rustic Mar del Plata home of Patricia Kadgien, the Nazi officer's daughter, but the painting wasn't there.",
      "Authorities earlier this week raided other homes belonging to the Kadgien sisters in Mar del Plata, seizing paintings and engravings that they similarly suspected of having been stolen during the 1940s.",
      "Argentina's federal prosecutor's office placed Patricia Kadgien and her husband under house arrest pending a hearing Thursday on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.",
      "Adler, the prosecutor, told reporters that the couple's lawyer had handed over the painting to authorities earlier Wednesday. He did not specify where the portrait would go next.",
      "An art expert invited to assist with the investigation, Ariel Bassano, said the painting was being \"stored in a special chamber\" for safekeeping.",
      "\"It's in good condition given its age,\" Bassano said, dating the portrait to 1710 and valuing it at roughly $50,000.",
      "It's not clear exactly how the painting came into the possession of Kadgien, who worked as a financial adviser to G\u00f6ring.",

      "Here's a look at some of the weapons that were on display, including some the world had not seen previously:",
      "Drones, AI and lasers",
      "China's LY-1 laser weapon was displayed during the parade for the first time, mounted on top of armored trucks. Defense analyst Alexander Neill told the BBC that the powerful device is believed to have the ability to disable electronics or blind pilots.",
      "There were a number of conventional drones on display, as well as some AI-powered ones.",
      "One that drew particular attention was the AJX002 giant submarine drone, which measures approximately 65 feet long.",
      "Also known as an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle, it could carry out reconnaissance or surveillance missions.",
      "China also showed off stealth attack drones in the parade, including the GJ-11, which is capable of flying alongside manned fighter jets and aiding them in their missions.",
      "\"Robotic wolves\" were also on display. Experts say the four-legged, walking robots could be used for numerous operations, such as sweeping for mines, reconnaissance missions or hunting down enemy troops.",
      "New nuclear-capable, long-range missiles",
      "A new version of China's Dongfeng-5 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-5C, was unveiled for the parade. It is said to have a longer range than previous variants, Neill told the BBC. He said the missile can also carry up to 12 warheads on a single mission.",
      "The new missile is silo-based, launched from underground facilities, and is meant to be a strategic deterrent, Neill said.",
      "According to The Associated Press, the DF-5C has an estimated range of about 12,400 miles, which makes it easily capable of reaching any part of the United States from mainland China.",
      "A number of other nuclear-capable missiles were rolled down central Beijing's Chang-an (\"Eternal Peace\") Avenue, including the DF-61. Like the DF-5C, it is an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the DF-61 can be fired from a mobile launcher. Little is known about the new weapon, but the previous model has a range of more than 7,500 miles, and it can also carry multiple warheads.",
      "The AP said China's parade also featured the JL-1 and JL-3 nuclear-capable long-range missiles, the first of which is launched from aircraft and the second from vessels at sea.",
      "China wants to \"replace traditional structures\"",
      "\"China not only wants to augment, but replace traditional structures,\" defense analyst Michael Raska told CBS News partner network BBC News, adding that it seems to have taken lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, where a strategy has been to \"throw drones at the enemy\" to wear down their defenses.",
      "While some countries are concerned about incorporating artificial intelligence into their military systems, China appears to be plowing ahead and \"believe they can control AI,\" Raska told the BBC. \"They are going all the way to integrate it into their systems.\"",
      "The parade showed that China has the resources to build up a significant arsenal, but Raska said the U.S. still maintains the edge operationally.",
      "The U.S. is more agile in battle because it has a \"bottom-up\" culture, where decisions can be made and adapted on the ground in response to evolving situations, Raska said. China, on the other hand, \"can have flashy platforms and systems but they will not move a finger until they receive an order from the top,\" Raska told the BBC.",
      "\"The Chinese think it's technology that creates deterrence. They believe that will deter the U.S.... but at the operational level, there have been instances which show they may not be as good as they say they are,\" Raska said.",

Mullaney was declared non-recoverable in May 1949, just under five years after the ship's sinking. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at Cambridge American Cemetery in England. He was awarded the Purple Heart, according to an obituary published in late August.",

Believed to be 12 or 13 years old and referred to as \"beloved child\" in North Korean state media, this was her first known trip outside the country.",
      "To casual observers, Kim Ju Ae's appearance Tuesday might be seen as a father-daughter bonding trip. But her arrival in China could be more than that: Kim Jong Un's signal that she is in the mix for future succession plans.",

      "Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, brought him to Beijing to present him as a successor when he was believed to be in his mid-20s. Kim Il Sung, the country's founder, did the same for his son Kim Jong Il. The intent was to begin building the next political relationship with Beijing for the future.",

      "London's police chief has appealed for change, arguing that his officers are in an \"impossible position\" as they try to navigate the evolving landscape of online free speech while enforcing existing laws that bar threats and incitement to violence. The Metropolitan Police chief has called on Britain's government to \"change or clarify\" the relevant laws after the controversial arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan over anti-transgender social media posts.",
      "Linehan, who co-created the popular 1990s British sitcom \"Father Ted\" and wrote and created the more contemporary \"The IT Crowd,\" says he was arrested by five armed officers at London's Heathrow Airport on Monday over his social media posts.",
      "On his page on the Substack platform, Linehan said he asserted in one of the X posts in question that trans women being in female-only spaces was a, \"violent, abusive act,\" and added a call for people who see trans women in such spaces to, \"make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails punch him in the balls.\"",

      "Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Mark Rowley has defended the officers who took Linehan into custody at Heathrow, saying in a statement seen by CBS News that the decision to arrest Linehan, \"was made within existing legislation \u2014 which dictates that a threat to punch someone from a protected group could be an offense.\"",
      "But, Rowley added: \"I don't believe we should be policing toxic culture wars debates and officers are currently in an impossible position.\"",
      "He said police would \"make similar decisions in future unless the law and guidance is changed or clarified.\"",
      "Britain's laws against inciting violence have been in place for decades, but in more recent years, specific legislation has also barred hate that targets people based on their sexual orientation or gender.",
      "Rowley acknowledged \"concern caused by such incidents given differing perspectives on the balance between free speech and the risks of inciting violence in the real world,\" and said Met officers would now pursue people over social media posts only, \"where there is a clear risk of harm or disorder.\"",
      "\"Where there is ambiguity in terms of intent and harm, policing has been left between a rock and a hard place by successive governments who have given officers no choice but to record such incidents as crimes when they're reported,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Health officials say Israel's growing offensive has killed at least 287 Gazans since international scholars, including Holocaust experts, called the war genocidal.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's expanding military offensive has killed at least 287 people in Gaza in the three days since a group of world-leading genocide scholars declared that Israel is committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.",
      "The International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 which includes Holocaust experts \u2014 declared in an Aug. 31 resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "As evidence, the group pointed to the killing or maiming of 50,000 children; Israeli leaders characterizing Palestinians in Gaza as \"human animals\" and threatening to \"flatten\" the territory and turn it into hell; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing President Trump's plan for the U.S. to\u00a0\"take over\" the strip\u00a0and have all of its inhabitants \"resettled\" elsewhere.",
      "The territory was home to approximately 2.3 million people before the war, which Israel launched in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack orchestrated by Gaza's Hamas rulers. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken as hostages into Gaza. Israel's leader has said 20 of those captives are still believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed the latest allegation of genocide, saying it was \"entirely based on Hamas' campaign of lies and the laundering of those lies by others.\" Its statement went on to say that it was the Israeli people who were actually subjected to genocide by Hamas with the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.",
      "Numerous leading human rights bodies, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Israeli organization B'Tselem and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, had all previously concluded that Israel's military operation in Gaza amounted to genocide. Israel has rejected all of the accusations, saying they are based on a false Hamas narrative.",
      "Since the scholars group declared a genocide on Aug. 31, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health has reported at least 287 people killed by Israeli operations, bringing the total death toll to at least 63,746, as well as 161,245 wounded, since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Israel has not allowed international journalists to enter Gaza and operate freely since the war began, despite repeated requests from CBS News and other organizations, so it is impossible to verify the health ministry's figures, which do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties. The U.N. considers the death toll reported by the ministry the most accurate information available, and Israel, while consistently denying the figures, has not provided its own reports on Palestinians killed during the war.",
      "The U.N. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said Wednesday, meanwhile, that at least 21,000 Gazan children had been rendered disabled by Israeli assaults since the war began.",
      "Fear grows along with Israel's offensive in Gaza City",
      "Israel recently declared Gaza City, the biggest population center in the Palestinian territory, a \"dangerous combat zone,\" and its forces have pushed forward with a controversial plan to seize the metropolis, which Israel's leader says is necessary to defeat Hamas.",
      "Parts of the city are already considered \"red zones,\" where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate ahead of expected heavy fighting.",
      "That has left residents on edge, including many who returned after fleeing the city in the initial stages of the war. With Israeli bulldozers razing the ground in occupied neighborhoods and some Israeli politicians openly supporting the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, many of the city's residents fear that departing now could mean leaving for good.",
      "Moving costs thousands of dollars and finding space in the overcrowded south to pitch a tent feels impossible. But staying behind, many say, could be deadly.",
      "\"The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red color and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,\" Mohammed Alkurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, told The Associated Press. \"So it's like you decide whether to live or die. It's very simple like that.\"",
      "Since Israel declared the area a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction \u2014 some 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly 1 million that the U.N. estimates are still in Gaza City \u2014 had left their homes as of Monday, most to flee to the south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that coordinates assistance for people in displacement sites.",
      "A fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.",
      "Alkurdi, a project manager and consultant, told the AP he could hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he's sheltering as they \"erase the area completely.\"",
      "Zeitoun was once Gaza City's largest neighborhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighboring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by the AP from early August and early September. The photos show entire blocks have been pummeled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots.",
      "\"It's not something partial like before. It's 100%,\" Alkurdi said. \"The house, I'm telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.\"",
      "Many of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi's home was completely destroyed, so he's now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He said he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.",
      "Netanyahu defended the Gaza City offensive before it began, insisting the Israeli military had \"no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.\" He has said repeatedly that the objective of the war is to demilitarize the enclave, maintain the Israeli military's \"overriding security control\" over it, and put a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge. He also says it is aimed at freeing the remaining hostages, though many of the captives' families have voiced concern that expanding the offensive into densely packed Gaza City will put them at greater risk.",
      "For Gaza's residents, the operation is already bringing more violence, and the prospect of more upheaval.",
      "Amal Seyam is the general director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza. Originally from the Tuffah neighborhood in eastern Gaza City, her home was destroyed by bombardment. For nearly four months, she has been sheltering in the Nasr neighborhood in the city's west, where she stays alongside her colleagues inside the women's center.",
      "Seyam has been displaced five times since the war began \u2014 three times within the city and twice to the south, in Rafah and Khan Younis. Each time, she fled with nothing.",
      "When asked if she would consider leaving Gaza City as Israeli forces advance, Seyam said: \"I will only leave when everyone who needs me here leaves. As long as there's a woman who needs me, I am staying. All of Gaza feels like it's in the red zone now anyway. The bombing is happening meters from us, not kilometers.\"",
      "She paused, her voice breaking into tears.",
      "\"Many people have started packing. Many have already left. Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.\"",

      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region.

      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0The British Embassy in Cairo said Sunday that it had temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed concrete security barriers from around the compound's exterior perimeter. The barriers had been there for decades as a security measure.",
      "\"The main Embassy building is temporarily closed while we review the impact of works undertaken by the Egyptian authorities in the vicinity,\" a U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson told CBS News in a statement on Monday, noting that the embassy remained in operation and only the primary building was closed.",
      "There was no official comment from the Egyptian government about the removal of the barriers outside the U.K. embassy, but the move came amid escalating diplomatic tension between Egypt and several countries over protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad, including in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Turkey, the U.K., Canada, the U.S, and in Israel.",
      "In recent months, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have chained the doors of Egyptian embassies and consulates closed from the outside and spray-painted slogans on their walls, mostly demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing between northeast Egypt and the war-torn Gaza Strip.",
      "Egyptian officials have said their side of the Rafah crossing has remained open since the Gaza war erupted almost two years ago, while the Israeli military controls the Palestinian side and how much aid is allowed in, and how many people are allowed out.",

      "In a\u00a0statement published online that day by the Egyptian government, the foreign ministry said it was following his detention \"with great concern\" and had requested urgent clarification of the circumstances surrounding the arrest, stressing Egypt expected his \"prompt release.\"",

      "The police said officers were called at 10 p.m. local time on Aug. 25 \"to reports of a man with a knife in a caf\u00e9\" in London's Westminster area. The spokesperson said he \"was arrested at the scene on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, threats to kill and affray,\" and confirmed that he was later released on bail.",

      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership\" and, while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade was a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi was not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and military power \u2014 and the potential to back up his vision of a new world order. It was a message that many see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

      "When is China's military parade?",

      "Who is attending China's military parade?",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are among the dignitaries who attended the parade. It was the first time Kim, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin appeared together. The trio has\u00a0been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",

      "The 70-minute parade displayed China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and underwater drones.

      "How did President Trump respond?",
      "In a\u00a0post to Truth Social on Tuesday evening, President Trump noted that the U.S. and China were allies against Japan during WWII, writing that the \"big question to be  answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and 'blood' that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has touted himself as a Nobel-worthy peacemaker. Here's what some foreign policy analysts say about the disputes he cites.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a\u00a0peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to\u00a0broker a deal between the countries and\u00a0suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate\u00a0a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterward.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

Greg Abbott of Texas on Friday signed into law a redistricting bill passed by the Republican super majority in the state legislature that aims to create up to five right-leaning congressional districts at the expense of currently Democrat-controlled seats in the reliably red state.",
      "The Republican push in Texas, which came at the urging of President Donald Trump, is part of a broad effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.",

Some third-party sites look like they're offering a convenient service, but they often collect extra data about you and sometimes even resell it. Going straight to the source means your sensitive details don't take unnecessary detours.",
      "When you sell your home, more than just the price gets published. Your name, past addresses and even photos of your home can become part of the public record. Ask your realtor what's automatically disclosed and whether anything can be limited or redacted. It's worth being picky here: the less of your personal footprint that's tied to your property, the better.",
      "Moving is the perfect excuse to purge. But don't just throw out old bills, medical statements, or financial records; shred them. Dumpster-diving for personal data may sound outdated, but it's still a method scammers use. A good shredder ensures your sensitive history doesn't end up in the wrong hands.",
      "It's tempting to post a \"Goodbye, old house!\" photo online, but resist the urge. Publicly announcing a move tells scammers exactly when your home is empty and what your new address might be. Instead, share the news directly with family and close friends. A little less buzz online means a lot more safety offline.",
      "One powerful way to stay ahead of scammers is to freeze your credit. A freeze blocks new credit accounts from being opened in your name, even if criminals have your address or other details. The good news is that you can do this for free with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "It only takes a few minutes online or by phone, and you can lift the freeze anytime if you need to apply for a loan or credit card. By freezing your credit before and after your move, you create a strong barrier that keeps thieves from turning stolen data into financial damage.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Moving should feel like a new beginning, not an invitation for scammers to strike. With a few smart steps, you can stay ahead of data brokers and fraudsters. From shredding documents to freezing your credit, every action adds a layer of protection. By protecting your information before and after your move, you gain peace of mind and start your next chapter on solid ground. The effort is small compared to the security it brings.",

      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",
      "GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY",
      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

      "DON'T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Scammers impersonating local authorities are on the rise, telling victims they missed jury duty and must pay to avoid legal trouble. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What jury duty scam victims need to know",
      "Scammers posing as court officials are targeting individuals with false claims about missed jury duty, prompting warnings from law enforcement. The fraud typically begins with a call from a blocked or unknown number, alleging that the recipient has missed jury duty and is facing an arrest warrant. The scammers then demand payment, usually through wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "A key warning sign is being asked to pay money to avoid arrest or legal trouble. It is important never to give money or personal information to unknown callers.",
      "These scams often target older or more vulnerable individuals, although younger people have also reported close calls. In one example, a person received repeated calls from an unidentified number before answering. The caller, claiming to be from a local sheriff's department and equipped with the individual's full name and address, insisted they had failed to appear for jury duty and faced multiple citations.",

      "Victims can spot jury duty impersonation scams by verifying suspicious calls before taking action and reducing their digital footprint. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to spot jury duty impersonation scams",
      "No jury duty arrest warrants: Missing jury duty doesn't lead to criminal citations or warrants.Blocked or spoofed numbers: Real law enforcement won't hide their identity.Unusual payment methods: No government agency will ask for gift cards or crypto.Aggressive threats:\u00a0Threats of arrest or contempt of court are a scare tactic.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from jury duty scam calls",
      "If you get a suspicious call about missed jury duty, don't panic. Follow these steps to stay safe and protect your personal information.",
      "This might sound obvious, but don't trust any unknown caller, especially if they demand money. Legitimate authorities will never ask for payment over the phone, especially not through gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. If someone threatens you with arrest or legal action unless you pay immediately, it's almost certainly a scam. Hang up and call your local court or police department using an official number.",
      "If you receive a suspicious call, take a breath and fact-check. Court summonses are always delivered by mail, not over the phone. Even if the caller has personal information like your name or address, that doesn't make them credible. Scammers often use leaked or publicly available data to appear convincing.",
      "Be extra cautious, even if the scam comes through text messages or email. Do not click on any suspicious links, as they can install malware on your device and steal your personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Investing in a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint by scrubbing your information from people-search sites and data brokers.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Older adults are frequent targets. Sit down with your parents, grandparents, or neighbors to explain how these scams work and what to watch for. A simple heads-up could stop a costly mistake.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Scammers are getting bolder and more convincing, but you can stay a step ahead.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Instead of relying on faceless phishing emails, scammers are now using hyper-personalized and emotionally charged phone calls. By impersonating local authorities and referencing civic duties like jury duty, they exploit both fear and a sense of responsibility. What makes this especially dangerous is how plausible it sounds, drawing on real processes that many people don't fully understand.",

      "Honeywell Aerospace's \"Surface Alert System,\" or \"SURF-A,\" can detect when a rogue aircraft gets in the way of another plane that has been cleared for takeoff or landing. The system gives pilots two aural alerts when an unauthorized aircraft enters the runway on a collision course with the authorized aircraft. The first alert sounds 30 seconds before a collision, and the second alert sounds 15 seconds before a collision.",
      "\"It sounds like such a small amount of time, but things happen so rapidly, and 15 to 30 seconds is actually a very, very large margin when you're moving at the speeds that we're moving in an aircraft like this,\" Honeywell test pilot Doug Rybczynski said.",

      "The Honeywell crew flew from the Kansas City Downtown airport in Missouri to Topeka, Kansas. On Test Flight 757's approach to Topeka, a Honeywell crew member parked a smaller Gulfstream aircraft at the end of the runway, triggering the SURF-A alert system. After hearing both alerts, the pilot performed a \"go-around\" maneuver.",
      "The demonstration simulated a 2023 close call at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas. In that scenario, a FedEx B767 was cleared to land in poor conditions. As the FedEx plane got closer, the pilots noticed a Southwest Airlines B737 lined up on the runway below them. The FedEx pilots were able to perform a last-second go-around maneuver to avoid a collision, but Honeywell says the SURF-A system, which wasn't around at the time, would have given the pilots an additional 28 seconds of notice.",

      "Honeywell started developing the SURF-A system in 2020 when the aviation industry noticed more close calls happening on runways. Using \"ADS-B\" Out technology, a GPS system that makes an airplane's position known to other pilots, engineers were able to determine the trajectory of planes that are on a collision course.",

      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people. Research already shows children ages 3 to 6 sometimes trust robots more than humans, even when the robots give wrong answers. That undermines how kids build empathy, learn to question, and develop critical thinking. There are also privacy concerns. Parents may not realize that these\u00a0\"personalized\" toys are recording conversations. Sensitive information could be stored, analyzed, or misused without families fully knowing.",

      "Pediatric experts in early childhood and language development warn that responsive AI could\u00a0\"fundamentally change the wiring of the human brain.\" Unlike television or passive media, AI plushies respond in real time, adapting to a child's questions, stories, and moods. That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

In fact, some early research shows kids learn new words faster when engaging in dialogue with AI rather than passively consuming media. But the tradeoff is significant.

      "Now, credit reporting firm TransUnion has confirmed its own major incident, with more than 4.4 million U.S. consumers affected.\u00a0Attackers exploited weaknesses in third-party integrations, not Salesforce itself.

      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Data stolen in breaches often ends up fueling phishing campaigns. Attackers may use your name, email or phone number to make messages look more convincing. If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your login details were exposed, reusing the same password across sites puts multiple accounts at risk. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",

It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",

      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device.

      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible.

      "In a notice published on its website, the U.S. insurance giant said the breach occurred on May 29, 2025, through one of its third-party vendors. Farmers serves over 10 million households nationwide. It offers auto, home, life, and business insurance through a vast network of agents and subsidiaries.",
      "\"On May 30, 2025, one of Farmers' third-party vendors alerted Farmers to suspicious activity involving an unauthorized actor accessing one of the vendor's databases containing Farmers' customer information,\" the company wrote in its advisory.",

      "According to the company, the vendor's monitoring tools detected the intrusion quickly, allowing containment measures to be taken. Farmers said it immediately launched an investigation, notified law enforcement, and worked to determine the scope of the breach.",
      "The investigation revealed that the stolen data included customer names, addresses, dates of birth, and driver's license numbers. In some cases, the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Farmers began notifying affected individuals on Aug. 22, with a filing to the Maine Attorney General's Office confirming that 1,111,386 customers were impacted.",
      "While Farmers did not publicly name the vendor involved, reports indicate that the breach is part of the larger Salesforce data theft campaign carried out by threat actors this year.",

      "The Salesforce data theft campaign",
      "The Salesforce attacks have been ongoing since early 2025. Researchers attributed them to a threat actor cluster tracked as UNC6040/UNC6240. The intrusions typically begin with voice phishing (vishing) calls, where employees are tricked into approving a malicious OAuth application linked to their company's Salesforce instance.",
      "Once connected, attackers siphon customer relationship management (CRM) databases and use the stolen data in extortion attempts. The cybercrime group ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility, according to BleepingComputer. The group claims that the attacks involve overlapping threat groups, including members of the notorious Scattered Spider gang.",

The incident involved only limited information from certain customers.

      "After a data breach, attackers often follow up with phishing emails or phone calls. They pretend to be from your insurance company or a support service. Don't click on links in unsolicited messages, and verify any claims through official channels before responding. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Change your passwords for all important accounts. Start with email, financial, and health-related logins. Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Together, they built a family. Verardo delighted in being Dad to Grace, known as Gigi, Mary Scott and Elizabeth. Sarah sought to help other families by writing \"Hero at Home,\" a children\u2019s book explaining the unseen wounds of war.\u00a0On Tuesday, their eldest daughter, now 11, stood bravely before the congregation. \"I am proud of my dad because he fought so long and so hard to stay alive for us. He never gave up,\" Gigi said. \"If I could tell him one thing right now, it would be thank you. Thank you for being my dad. I love you. I promise I will never forget you, and you\u2019ll be part of everything I do every single day.\"",
      "Even as he endured his own battles, Verardo devoted himself to lifting others. With Sarah, he championed the Independence Fund\u2019s Trackchairs program, giving wounded warriors freedom of movement once thought lost, and Operation Resiliency, a lifeline for veterans struggling after war aimed at reuniting veterans to prevent suicide. His work became a mission of service beyond the battlefield, proof that sacrifice could be transformed into hope for others.",

Back home, he made it his mission to recover, to raise a family, to help others. Michael never fully recovered from his wounds on that battlefield, but he did not let that stop him. Mission accomplished, my friend.\"",
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence spoke of a soldier whose faith never dimmed. \"Through it all, he smiled, radiating a faith and courage that inspired everyone he encountered. This time last week, on the far side of forever, someone else smiled first. And Michael, now whole again, heard the words: \u2018Well done, good and faithful servant'.\"",
      "The sanctuary was filled with Verardo\u2019s comrades, paratroopers, medics, and brothers-in-arms, a gathering that Col. Adam Armstrong called a testament to his character.",

      "In her final farewell, Sarah shared the vow she made as the American flag was laid across her husband\u2019s body. \"When these heroic first responders draped the American flag over him, I told Michael\u2026 I will love you forever.

      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

      "Turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and states\u2019 beginning to take more control of their own vaccine decisions threaten to fracture the once-national consensus around immunization, setting the stage for a reorganization of the way vaccination recommendations work across the United States.",
      "The moves together point toward an increasingly stark divide emerging in the United States around vaccinations, with some Republican-led states starting to roll back or eliminate mandates while Democrat-led states split from the CDC to come up with their own vaccination guidance.",
      "On Wednesday, California, Oregon and Washington announced they are forming a public health alliance to provide \u201ccredible information\u201d about vaccine safety in response to the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, the resignations of top scientists that followed her ousting and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s new controversial guidelines for who should get Covid shots.",
      "Last week, New Mexico\u2019s Health Department announced it was ordering pharmacies to \u201cremove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d Colorado did the same Wednesday.",
      "Also Wednesday, Florida\u2019s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, moved to eliminate vaccination mandates across the state, including in public schools. Other states have also weighed rolling back vaccination mandates, most notably Texas, where dozens of anti-mandate bills have been introduced in the Legislature.",
      "The split comes as once-fringe and long-debunked claims about the health risks of vaccinations have found mainstream appeal and been embraced by the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cRepeatedly hearing that vaccines cause autism or that an mRNA vaccine will alter your DNA can erode public trust,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco, referring to two of the most common pieces of vaccine misinformation.",
      "For decades, the federal government, in close collaboration with infectious disease experts, has crafted guidelines for who should receive vaccinations and when. States and medical organizations used the guidelines to administer shots to millions of people, and insurance companies relied on them to determine payment. The recommendations were based on clinical studies and aimed to minimize both individual and societal risk.",
      "But as vaccine hesitancy has skyrocketed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and online misinformation campaigns, vaccination mandates have become a political flashpoint. Distrust in vaccines has created a rift that threatens to split the country into two distinct zones, delineated not by borders or geography but by state governments\u2019 stances on the medical establishment\u2019s right to dictate who must get a jab and who gets a pass.",
      "In an op-ed Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described \u201ccloth masks on toddlers, arbitrary 6-foot distancing, boosters for healthy children, prolonged school closings, economy-crushing lockdowns, and the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs\u201d as \u201cirrational\u201d policies that had a \u201cdevastating\u201d toll on Americans.",
      "Lockdowns and school closures certainly had economic and mental health drawbacks, and data suggests that vaccinated and unvaccinated people may transmit the virus at similar rates because they have comparable viral loads \u2014 or amounts of virus in their respiratory tracts \u2014  according to a 2022 paper in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.",
      "However, the vaccines were effective at reducing hospitalizations and the number of severe Covid cases, two factors that overwhelmed health care systems early in the pandemic and precipitated lockdowns in the United States and around the world.",
      "Once Covid vaccines became available at the end of 2020, following intense investment by the first Trump administration, states started to ease lockdowns and social distancing rules.",
      "What didn\u2019t let up \u2014 and still hasn\u2019t \u2014 was the fear around the purported dangers of the new Covid shots, which were developed using a new type of vaccine technology, known as mRNA, that was at once revolutionary but difficult to understand.",
      "The novelty compounded the uncertainties about the long-term health repercussions of a previously unknown virus and the pervasive feelings of loss the pandemic created, including loss of personal freedoms. That created the perfect conditions for divisiveness over vaccinations, Chin-Hong said, and the Covid shots became an easy scapegoat.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is something you could focus on, instead of a general feeling of loss,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy, among the highest-profile figures of the once-small anti-vaccine movement, was confirmed as HHS secretary as he struck a more moderate tone on vaccines, which he has since abandoned.",
      "In June, Kennedy gutted a 17-person independent vaccine advisory committee at the CDC. He replaced the members with a group that included vaccine skeptics and people critical of the Covid vaccines. In early August, he also cut $500 million in mRNA vaccine contracts.",
      "After the FDA approved a new version of the Covid vaccine in May, Kennedy announced that the CDC would recommend that doctors administer the shots only to adults ages 65 and above, as well as people with certain pre-existing conditions. Previously, Covid vaccinations were recommended more widely.",
      "Following that change, the American Academy of Pediatrics took the unusual step of issuing its own vaccination recommendations \u2014 the first time in 30 years its guidelines were significantly different from the federal government\u2019s.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be somewhat confusing. But our opinion is we need to make the right choices for children to protect them,\u201d Dr. James Campbell, vice chair of the academy\u2019s infectious diseases committee, told NBC News.",
      "That might have been the first visual fracture in the country\u2019s growing vaccine divide.",
      "The governors of California, Oregon and Washington are following in those footsteps, saying they are working to provide unified recommendations to \u201censure residents remain protected by science, not politics.\u201d They warned that there will be severe consequences if the CDC becomes \u201ca political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists \u2014 and his blatant politicization of the agency \u2014 is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,\u201d the statement said.",
      "HHS criticized Democratic-run states in a statement for pandemic policies that \u201ceroded the American people\u2019s trust in public health agencies.\u201d It also defended the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "\u201cACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The news release announcing the West Coast Health Alliance on Wednesday criticized the CDC\u2019s dismantling, saying there is an absence of consistent, science-based federal leadership in public health. It said the alliance\u2019s shared principles will be finalized \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Without clarity from the federal government, individual states may begin to craft their own public health orders. New Mexico\u2019s Health Department announced last week that it was ordering pharmacies to \u201cremove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d after some pharmacies said they couldn\u2019t administer the new versions of the Covid shots until the CDC advisory panel met and issued its official guidance.",
      "Insurance companies, which look to the federal government for guidance about what\u2019s covered by health plans, will also be figuring out the changing landscape in coming months.",
      "Vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are generally free because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.",
      "Tina Stow, a spokesperson for the health insurance industry group AHIP, said in a statement that the organization was reviewing the FDA announcement and would monitor upcoming recommendations from the CDC \u201con considerations around coverage,\u201d alongside its members.",
      "\u201cIndividual health plans and plan sponsors will be prepared to make coverage decisions informed by science, the latest medical evidence and data,\u201d she said. \u201cThis process will be evidence-based, evaluate multiple sources of data, including but not limited to ACIP, and will be informed by customer needs.\u201d",
      "Coverage decisions for vaccinations can also hinge on recommendations from medical organizations like the American Association of Pediatrics.",
      "More chaos unfolded at the CDC in recent days after the White House said it was firing Monarez as its director after she refused to resign. Attorneys for Monarez said she \u201crefused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts\u201d and \u201cchose protecting the public over serving a political agenda.\u201d",
      "Her dismissal sparked a mass exodus of top CDC officials. Nine former directors and acting directors accused Kennedy of endangering Americans in an essay Monday in The New York Times.",
      "\u201cDuring our respective C.D.C. tenures, we did not always agree with our leaders, but they never gave us reason to doubt that they would rely on data-driven insights for our protection, or that they would support public health workers,\u201d they wrote.",
      "They urged Congress to \u201cexercise its oversight authority\u201d over HHS and called on state and local governments and philanthropic givers to fill in the gaps where possible.",
      "Kennedy defended his decisions, including gutting the CDC, in his own guest essay Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal. He accused the CDC of squandering public trust for decades.",
      "He wrote that the organization should focus on infectious diseases \u2014 its original mission \u2014 and that other programs focused on chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart conditions, should be moved away from the CDC.",
      "\u201cThe CDC must restore public trust \u2014 and that restoration has begun,\u201d Kennedy wrote."

      "In a statement, Schwalb said that deploying the National Guard for law enforcement purposes was \u201cunnecessary and unwanted\u201d and \u201cdangerous and harmful\u201d to the city\u2019s residents.",
      "\u201cNo American city should have the US military \u2014 particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement \u2014 policing its streets,\u201d Schwalb said. \u201cIt\u2019s DC today, but could be any other city tomorrow. We\u2019ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.\u201d",
      "The suit says that the government\u2019s \u201cunprecedented, unlawful actions\u201d have caused \u201cirreparable harm\u201d by infringing on the city\u2019s right to self-governance, fueling distrust toward local law enforcement, and depressing business and tourism.",
      "Trump has talked about sending troops to cities such as Chicago, New Orleans and Baltimore.",
      "The military presence in Washington has been accompanied by a massive presence of federal law enforcement officers, who are often playing an assistance role and trailing behind other law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in the city.",
      "Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has treaded carefully with the Trump administration and pointed out the vulnerability of the city to acts by the federal government, has said the presence of National Guard troops is \u201cnot working\u201d but credited the Trump administration\u2019s surge with bringing down crime."

    "story": [
      "Several years ago, Jim Murphy typed out a note on his phone that he would look at and repeat every day.",
      "I\u2019m a New York Times best-selling author.",
      "Since his book \"Inner Excellence\" was published in 2009, that affirmation had yet to come true. But if his sales were low, his confidence wasn\u2019t. The book had earned clients for his business coaching athletes, from professional golfers to Olympians, by using such affirmations of visualizing success. When Murphy got the publishing rights back to \"Inner Excellence\" from his original publisher in 2018, he rewrote a new edition and published it himself.",
      "\u201cI had an amazing life,\u201d Murphy told NBC News. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t a super-well-known life.\u201d",
      "All that changed in January.",
      "During a Jan. 12 broadcast of Philadelphia\u2019s playoff win over Green Bay, a camera caught Eagles receiver A.J. Brown sitting on the sideline between possessions, reading Murphy\u2019s book. Among the more than 36 million people watching the Fox broadcast were internet sleuths who quickly deduced the book\u2019s title.",
      "\u201cInner Excellence\u201d had sold five copies one week in December and nine in another, according to Bookscan, which captures print-edition sales. In the three weeks after Brown was seen reading it, more than 200,000 copies were sold on Amazon, Murphy said. Before the shot on national television, the book reportedly ranked 523,497th on the online giant\u2019s platform; afterward, it was first.",
      "What made the moment all the more jarring was that it came when Murphy's personal and professional lives were enduring a considerable ebb. As January began, his mother was days away from dying. Business had slowed enough that Murphy wasn\u2019t able to pay off his credit cards for the first time in years. He had long ago erased the affirmation about being a bestselling author off his phone.",
      "Days after Murphy, 58, had unwittingly become the season\u2019s most unexpected breakout star without having played a single down or called a single play, he was in Philadelphia to attend the Eagles' next playoff game on Jan. 19 as a guest of Brown when he tried to withdraw money at an ATM. His account, he was told, had insufficient funds. The next day, his mortgage payment bounced.",
      "His checking account may not have reflected it at that moment, but Murphy\u2019s life had been irrevocably changed. He was suddenly  America\u2019s most in-demand author."

    "summary": "Nu\u00f1ez played prickly accountant Oscar Martinez in the hit NBC comedy series. In the new Peacock show, his character is back, but things are different \u2014 especially with a new boss.",
    "story": [
      "More than 12 years after bidding farewell to the prickly and pragmatic accountant he played on the acclaimed NBC mockumentary \u201cThe Office,\u201d actor Oscar Nu\u00f1ez is reprising his career-defining role as Oscar Martinez in a new spinoff from the same creative team.",
      "But the Cuban American actor wants to make one thing abundantly clear to die-hard fans of the original Dunder Mifflin Paper Company: \u201cThe Paper,\u201d which premieres Thursday on Peacock and has already been renewed for a second season, is more of a spiritual successor than a direct offshoot of \u201cThe Office.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a new location in that universe,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez told NBC News in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a brand-new show with a whole new cast \u2014 other than myself being there, because I was part of the deal when they bought the paper company.\u201d",
      "Created by Greg Daniels, who developed the American version of \u201cThe Office,\u201d and Michael Koman, \u201cThe Paper\u201d finds the same unseen documentary crew, who captured the workplace antics at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of Dunder Mifflin, heading to Toledo, Ohio, to capture a ragtag group of employees\u2019 last-ditch attempt to turn around a struggling small-town newspaper.",
      "In the early minutes of the pilot episode, the documentary crew reveals that Dunder Mifflin was purchased by Enervate, an Ohio-based conglomerate that sells products made out of paper, in 2019.",
      "Oscar is one of the only Dunder Mifflin employees who decided to relocate himself to the company\u2019s headquarters after the sale, but he is certainly not thrilled to come face-to-face with the same people who prowled around his old workplace. \u201cGod, not again! I\u2019m not agreeing to any of this,\u201d he says in the pilot. \u201cYou can\u2019t use my voice, my likeness, my face, nothing!\u201d (A title card suggests otherwise: \u201cYes we can. There\u2019s no end date on the release Oscar signed in 2005.\u201d)",
      "In 2020, seven years after the show ended, \u201cThe Office\u201d became the most-streamed show in America, racking up over 57.7 billion total minutes watched and reigniting talks of a reunion or a reboot. According to Daniels, who had openly said that a typical reboot of \u201cThe Office\u201d was \u201cnot of interest\u201d to him, he took Nu\u00f1ez \u201cout to lunch a bunch of years ago at a rooftop pool at a Beverly Hills hotel and told him the idea\u201d of a new show centered around paper.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually 20 years after the show debuted, which seemed like a good excuse for the doc crew to return and stumble onto a new topic to explore with new characters,\u201d Daniels told NBC News. \u201cI was always worried about a spinoff negatively affecting the original show, but in talking with the original cast in recent years, I realized I was the only one still anxious about that.\u201d",
      "From the outset, Daniels knew he wanted Oscar to be the connective tissue between the two shows. \u201cThe reason Oscar works for me, in addition to his great comedy talent, is that his character on \u2018The Office\u2019 was maybe the only one who didn\u2019t evolve,\u201d Daniels explained. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave to run a bar, he didn\u2019t move to Austin and get into sports management, he didn\u2019t get married, he didn\u2019t reveal he got a Ph.D. He was pretty much the same person with his self-dignity intact at the end. There was no closure to reopen, and we are free to see what happens to him now without that anxiety that we\u2019re changing the ending of the other show.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez, for his part, recalled Daniels asking him \u201cin a very roundabout, general fashion\u201d whether he would be interested in returning to \u201cThe Office\u201d universe. The two met multiple times as Daniels was fleshing out the concept, but it wasn\u2019t until Daniels invited him to meet the writers of \u201cThe Paper\u201d last year that Nu\u00f1ez realized the show was actually happening.",
      "Any trepidation that he felt about stepping back into his onscreen alter ego\u2019s shoes was quickly assuaged on the first day of filming.",
      "\u201cIt was very exciting. I think Paul Lieberstein might\u2019ve been there [to visit],\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said, referring to \u201cThe Office\u201d showrunner and actor who played the role of Toby Flenderson. \u201cIt was fun to see Paul and Greg, and a lot of the crew was there too. It was a little strange, but I\u2019m playing the same character, so that part was easy.\u201d",
      "The 'know-it-all' accountant lands in a newsroom",
      "\u201cI love that he\u2019s a snob, that he\u2019s a know-it-all or thinks he\u2019s a know-it-all. I love people with delusions of grandeur. I think it\u2019s a very funny trait,\u201d the actor said about his character. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the same character, but in a different place with maybe less friends, maybe trying to feel out new people. He\u2019s just trying to make friends, but he hasn\u2019t had any major changes in his psyche; he hasn\u2019t changed the way he thinks about people or anything like that.\u201d",
      "But that is not to say that Oscar is exactly the same person he was during \u201cThe Office.\u201d In \u201cThe Paper,\u201d Oscar is encouraged to take more risks by idealistic, new editor-in-chief Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), who is the antithesis of Oscar\u2019s former boss, the self-absorbed manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Ned initially wants to hire more reporters to expand the paper\u2019s coverage, but after running into budgetary constraints, he convinces the office staff to volunteer as amateur reporters alongside their paid jobs. While working as the head accountant, Oscar ultimately develops an enthusiasm for reporting about the arts.",
      "Since the end of \u201cThe Office,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez has continued to embrace the role that transformed him from a little-known guest star into a fixture on one of the most popular shows of all time, appearing at fan conventions alongside former castmates. He has been particularly touched by the response he has received from younger fans, who are largely responsible for the show\u2019s streaming renaissance.",
      "\u201cI forget my character\u2019s gay because time goes by and years go by, and then I go to a convention and young people come up to me and go, \u2018Hey, thank you, man. I came out because of you. You helped me come out.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh s---, that\u2019s right. My character\u2019s gay. You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad I helped,\u2019\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said. \u201cI get all these thank-yous from these young people that it means so much to, and it\u2019s very moving.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez, who has been critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to roll back legal protections for LGBTQ people, said that he thinks \u201cit\u2019s more important now than ever\u201d that his character is gay. \u201cI like representing, defending and celebrating gay culture, especially when it\u2019s under attack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be an issue at all \u2014 what color your skin is, or what religion you are, or your sexual orientation. It shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s business. Don\u2019t legislate against people and make their lives horrible, or pick on people or scapegoat people. That\u2019s not right.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez knows that nothing will ever be able to compare to \u201cThe Office,\u201d which he believes was \u201cjust a funny show that holds up\u201d because of \u201cgreat writing\u201d and a \u201cgreat cast,\u201d but he believes \u201cThe Paper\u201d will appeal to newcomers and die-hards alike.",
      "But as for whether any former Dunder Mifflin employees could pop up in future seasons of \u201cThe Paper,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez insisted those decisions are above his pay grade. \u201cIt\u2019s out of my hands. It\u2019s out of their hands. That\u2019s not up to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the writing room and whatever ideas they\u2019ll come up with!\u201d"

      "However, renewed interest in the brothers' case, in part from the Netflix series, led to calls for Erik and Lyle Menendez to be released from prison, from viewers to celebrities like Kim Kardashian.",
      "Then-Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said he supported resentencing the brothers in October 2024, and though his successor, Nathan Hochman, opposed any potential resentencing, a judge ruled on May 13, 2025, to resentence both Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison.",

      "\u201cWe would always love to have Taylor play. She is a special, special talent, and obviously she would be welcome at any time,\u201d Goodell said.",
      "\u201cIs it in the works?\u201d Savannah Guthrie asked.",

      "Goodell also addressed the potential for the Super Bowl to be moved to a different date. While the game has been played in February for several years, there has been chatter around the idea of making the day after it a holiday so people don\u2019t have to go into work after staying up late. That has some fans pushing for the game to be played over Presidents Day weekend.",
      "According to Goodell, the Super Bowl could be played that weekend if the league expands its schedule to include 18 regular season games.",
      "\u201cI think if you went to 18 weeks regular season, that would probably occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible somewhere in the calendar, could happen before that, just because of the calendar it lays out. But I think 18 weeks would get you to that point. I think it\u2019d be a really great move.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do think it makes sense for a lot of reasons. Again, the quality of our game, and also, I think the timing works out great,\u201d he added."

      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",

These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now  looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of  Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said,  \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences  \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

      "The exchange between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin was caught on a hot mic Wednesday as the duo and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in their first-ever joint public appearance, led a delegation of 27 world leaders attending a massive military parade in Beijing.",
      "State-run broadcaster CCTV was livestreaming the event, which marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and providing the feed to other media organizations.",
      "As they ascended the rostrum at Tiananmen Square to watch the parade, Putin and Xi, who are both 72, appeared to be discussing the world\u2019s strides in life expectancy.",

      "It was unclear whether the conversation was also being translated for Kim, believed to be 41, who was smiling and looking toward the older leaders.",
      "Though they may have just been making conversation, the exchange holds extra weight because both Putin and Xi have indicated an interest in staying in office as long as possible.",
      "Xi, who has been president since 2013, was awarded a rare third term in 2023 after removing the two-term limit from the constitution five years earlier, breaking with China\u2019s longstanding tradition of changing leaders every decade. In another departure from historical practice, he has not given any sign of who his successor might be.",
      "Putin, who has been president or prime minister of Russia since 2000, won a controversial referendum in 2020 that amended the constitution to allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036. At that point, he would be 83 and Russia\u2019s longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great.",
      "Putin is known for his longstanding interest in longevity, and last year Russian lawmakers established an anti-aging research center called \u201cNew Health Preservation Technologies\u201d after Putin said the nation should focus on preserving the health of its citizens.",
      "Though Xi does not appear to have the same fixation, Chinese leaders tend to enjoy long lives, with Deng Xiaoping living until 92 and his successor, Jiang Zemin, making it to 96.",
      "Organ transplants are a sensitive subject in China, where rights groups say organs may still be harvested from executed prisoners even after the government pledged to end the controversial practice in 2014. China has long struggled with a shortage of donated organs because of cultural taboos, and in 2023 the government issued new rules tightening regulation and promoting public awareness.",
      "There was little discussion of the two leaders\u2019 impromptu exchange on Chinese social media, which is heavily censored.",
      "Putin confirmed the conversation with Xi when asked about it by reporters later Wednesday, saying, \u201cOh, I believe the chairman talked about it when we were going to the parade.\u201d",
      "\u201cModern means, both health improvement, and medical means, and even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement, allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\u201d he said.",
      "He also made an apparent reference to United Nations estimates that by 2050 there will be more than twice as many people over 60 as children under 5.",
      "\u201cThis will have social, political and economic consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should certainly think about this too when we talk about life expectancy.\u201d"

      "After coming across the image of the painting, the journalists contacted Patricia Kadgien, but did not receive a response for weeks, according to their report in AD.",
      "The image of the painting was soon replaced with an image of a tapestry, and an initial raid by Argentinian authorities on the family home did not find the artwork.",
      "But prosecutors carried out four raids at different locations that belonged to the Kadgien family this week and both Patricia Kadgien and her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, were placed under house arrest, pending a formal hearing Thursday on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.",
      "Adler, the prosecutor, told reporters that the couple\u2019s lawyer had handed over the painting to authorities Wednesday. He did not specify where the portrait would go next.",
      "\u201cMy search for the artwork of my father-in-law, Jacques Goudstikker, began in the late 1990s and I have not given up to this day,\u201d Goudstikker\u2019s daughter-in-law Marei von Saher told AD. \u201cIt is my family\u2019s goal to recover every artwork stolen from the Goudstikker collection and to restore Jacques\u2019 legacy.\u201d"

      "\u201cTrump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\" a White House official told NBC News on Thursday after Trump spoke to European leaders.

      "\u201cThese drug cartels, what they do is they know they\u2019re going to lose 2% of their cargo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey bake it into their economics. What will stop them is when you blow them up.\u201d",
      "Additional U.S. military forces",

      "\u201cThe youth of the United States do not believe the lies of the big shot in the White House, Marco Rubio,\" Maduro said. \"Because who runs the White House is Marco Rubio \u2014 the mafia of Miami \u2014 who wants to fill Donald Trump\u2019s hands with blood.\u201d",
      "More actions expected",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s strike against the cartel boat may only be the beginning of its actions in the region.",

That gave the White House new legal authorities to take military action against such groups throughout the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Asked about the cartels in an interview last month, Rubio said it was time they were treated \u201cas armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug-dealing organizations.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is a criminal enterprise \u2014 all the way to the various cartels that operate in Mexico, and in between,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, what it changes is it gives us legal authorities to target them in ways you can\u2019t do if they\u2019re just a bunch of criminals. It\u2019s no longer a law enforcement issue. It becomes a national security issue.\u201d",

      "In the latter, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to fast-track consideration of the case so oral arguments can be heard as soon as the first week of November. That would require the court to decide by next week whether to hear the case.",
      "The challengers have agreed to that timeline, a Liberty Justice Center spokesman said.",
      "The appeals court's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President\u2019s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The filings included a declaration by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing the importance of a quick ruling.",
      "\"Swift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\" he wrote.",
      "The high court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees. Although it has frequently ruled in favor of Trump in the first few months of his term, some legal experts believe it may be more skeptical about his tariff powers.",
      "During the Biden administration, the court was skeptical of the White House\u2019s moves to seek broad powers via laws enacted by Congress that did not explicitly authorize them. In one significant example, the court, endorsing what has been dubbed the \"major questions doctrine,\" ruled against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The case under appeal affects two sets of tariffs Trump has imposed. The first are the country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which now range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The second is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented under other laws, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, were implemented under other statutes not at issue in the case.",
      "Even if Trump loses at the Supreme Court, he has other avenues to impose additional tariffs.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, and Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, are among five businesses that sued Trump over his use of the emergency law. Twelve states also challenged the move.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, prompting the Trump administration to appeal.",
      "Trump has long sought to raise revenue by taxing imported goods, which he believes will revitalize manufacturing in the United States. While the tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, economists say they are slowing U.S. economic growth, while inflation has also ticked up."

Both regions host a heavy concentration of Russian military units specializing in electronic warfare.",
      "In March 2024, a Royal Air Force plane carrying the U.K.\u2019s then\u2013defense secretary, Grant Shapps, also reported a spoofing incident, where false location data was fed to the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems.",

      "Officials said they had been investigating a criminal syndicate believed to be working with \u201ctrusted insiders\u201d at Sydney ports to import commercial quantities of illegal drugs into Australia.",
      "They said they had received intelligence that a group was planning to remove illicit drugs from an imported shipping container while it was stored on the Sydney waterfront.",
      "On Sunday, a 25-year-old man was arrested while exiting the shipping container, whose legitimate cargo had already been unloaded. Police said they found a crowbar, an angle grinder, ear protection, portable lights and other tools inside that they alleged the man was using to cut through a false wall at the back of the shipping container.",
      "Behind the wall were 506 blocks of cocaine weighing 1 kilo (2.2 pounds) each, for a total of more than 1,115 pounds. The shipment had a street value of more than 164 Australian dollars ($106 million), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said Tuesday in a joint news release with the New South Wales Police Force.",
      "The 25-year-old man, along with two others ages 38 and 42, appeared in a New South Wales court on Monday, with only the 42-year-old being released on bail.",
      "If convicted, the three men could face life in prison. They are next expected to appear in court on Oct. 29.",
      "Though the shipping container came from Europe, police said they were still investigating the origin of the cocaine. Searches of two of the men\u2019s homes found 330,000 Australian dollars (about $215,000) in cash suspected of being proceeds from crime.",
      "\u201cTo anyone lured in by the false promise of riches from drug importations \u2014 these offenses carry the potential of life in jail,\u201d AFP Detective Superintendent Peter Fogarty said.",
      "The investigation was carried out by the Multi Agency Strike Team, a collaboration between Australian law enforcement agencies that aims to \u201cinvestigate and target trusted insiders assisting transnational serious organized crime syndicates.\u201d",
      "There have been a series of recent drug busts in Australia, including late last year when police seized a record 2.3 tons of cocaine and arrested 13 people in raids after the suspects\u2019 boat broke down off the coast of Queensland.",
      "In 2022, police also found 2 U.S. tons of methamphetamine hidden in marble tiles shipped from the Middle East to Sydney in what they said was the largest-ever seizure of the illicit drug in the country."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s military is getting stronger, and it wants the world to know it.",
      "The world\u2019s largest active military, with more than 2 million personnel, is holding one of its biggest parades ever on Wednesday, a highly choreographed \u201cVictory Day\u201d spectacle to mark the 80th anniversary of Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender at the end of World War II.",
      "The grand occasion in Beijing will showcase not just China\u2019s growing ability to rival the United States in any future conflict, but support from some of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned nations in a display of unity against the West.",
      "Thousands of troops will march through Tiananmen Square, where they will be reviewed by Chinese President Xi Jinping as heads of government and state from 26 other countries look on.",
      "Topping the guest list are Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has pressed on with his war against Ukraine despite a U.S. peace push, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a rare departure from his isolated, nuclear-armed state.",
      "Leaders from the United States and other Western governments have declined to attend the parade, partly because of the presence of Putin.",
      "It comes amid heightened military tensions in the region as China clashes with neighbors in the South China Sea and the U.S. and its allies brace for potential conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a show of force,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s a means to show China\u2019s neighbors, other countries around the world, that China\u2019s military is formidable.\u201d",
      "The parade will showcase China\u2019s growing military power under Xi, who has overseen a modernization campaign as well as political purges of senior officials and even defense ministers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now become a much more capable force that is increasingly a near peer, if not a true peer, to the U.S. military in many respects,\u201d said Elsa B. Kania, a doctoral candidate at Harvard and an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington that specializes in U.S. national security issues.",
      "China, whose annual defense spending is estimated to be about a third of the $1.3 trillion spent by the United States, has said its goal is for military modernization to be \u201cbasically complete\u201d by 2035, and for the Chinese military to be \u201cworld class\u201d by 2049, the 100th anniversary of communist rule.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the only world-class military in the world, and we still have a need to catch up with the United States \u2014 and it will take time,\u201d Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told NBC News in an interview.",
      "\u201cBut I believe by 2049, which is still far away, we should be confident to reach the objective,\u201d said Zhou, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army.",
      "Confidence on display",
      "Security has been tight in Beijing in the weeks leading up to the parade, disrupting businesses and traffic. Tanks could be heard rolling down the streets during weekly overnight rehearsals that paralyzed the city center and were conducted with great secrecy.",
      "This is China\u2019s first military parade since 2019, when Beijing commemorated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and its third under Xi, who also held one in 2015 for the 70th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender.",
      "The legacy of World War II is still a sensitive subject between Japan and China, which is estimated to have suffered between 20 million and 35 million military and civilian deaths during a 14-year Japanese invasion and occupation that China calls the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.",
      "The parade is aimed just as much at the Chinese public as it is at foreign adversaries, said Thompson, the former director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia at the U.S. Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fanning anti-Japanese sentiments to increase the party\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of its own people,\u201d he said, particularly at a time when the Chinese public is concerned about a slowing economy.",
      "Japan, a key U.S. ally, has reportedly urged other countries not to attend, leading China to lodge a diplomatic complaint.",
      "According to the Chinese government, much of the equipment included in the 70-minute parade is being revealed for the first time.",
      "In addition to the troops, the parade will involve more than 100 aircraft and hundreds of ground armaments, all of them domestically made and battle-ready, officials said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Beijing.",
      "The \u201cnew-generation\u201d equipment on display \u201creflects a high degree of informatization and intelligence, underscoring our military\u2019s ability to adapt to technological advances and evolving warfare patterns, and to win future conflicts,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Wu Zeke, deputy director of the parade.",
      "Air and missile defense systems that could make an appearance include the HQ-19 and the more advanced HQ-26 and HQ-29, all of which are designed to intercept ballistic missiles and are believed to have capabilities similar to equivalent U.S. systems.",
      "Military observers are also watching for any new intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as new supersonic and hypersonic missiles.",
      "Such missiles \u201cpose a big threat for U.S. naval ships\u201d that would be central to any U.S. military intervention in the Asia-Pacific, said Shinji Yamaguchi, a senior research fellow in the China Studies Division at the Japanese government\u2019s National Institute for Defense Studies.",
      "China is also expected to display autonomous drones, which especially since the war in Ukraine have \u201creally changed the way of warfare,\u201d Yamaguchi said, as well as unmanned underwater vehicles, also known as sea drones.",
      "In a conflict, China could deploy sea drones in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere \u201cto strengthen intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,\u201d Yamaguchi said.",
      "Jet fighters will also be in focus after Pakistan said it used Chinese-built J-10Cs to shoot down Indian aircraft during a four-day conflict in May.",
      "But while China has become more open about displaying weaponry as its confidence grows, it is difficult to know what is going on behind the scenes.",
      "The \u201cdramatic\u201d removal of officials \u201chas raised questions about Xi Jinping\u2019s trust in military leaders, or about whether systemic problems of corruption can be resolved,\u201d Kania said.",
      "There has also been little recent real-world demonstration of the actual capabilities of the Chinese military, whose last experience in a large-scale conflict was against Vietnam in 1979.",
      "\u201cNone of this has been tested. Nobody knows,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd this may be one of the reasons that China relies on this very conventional form of deterrence and signaling in the form of a parade.\u201d",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Janis Mackey Frayer from Beijing."

    "summary": "NATO governments have accused Russian intelligence agencies of remotely recruiting criminals and using them to sow chaos.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 As British detectives studied the grainy CCTV video of the burning warehouse, there was at first little reason to think they were looking at a covert Russian intelligence operation.",
      "The March 2024 video from the Cromwell Industrial Estate in east London showed two masked men pouring gasoline outside the warehouse door, setting it ablaze with a burning rag, and then fleeing into the night.",
      "The fact that the storage facility belonged to a Ukrainian logistics company that was shipping humanitarian aid and Starlink satellite internet dishes to Ukraine did not initially raise any alarms.",
      "But 10 days later when a warehouse belonging to the same company was set on fire in Spain\u2019s capital Madrid, detectives realized it was much bigger than a simple case of arson.",
      "The investigation and the prosecution that followed would shed light on what Western officials have warned is a dangerous Russian tactic: hiring local criminals to carry out acts of sabotage across Europe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new thing to see criminal proxies used on behalf of foreign states,\u201d Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, the head of the counter-terrorism unit at London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, in July. \u201cWe have seen this trend developing over the last year or two, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue to see it develop over the next year or so.\u201d",
      "Over the last year, NATO governments have accused Russian intelligence agencies of remotely recruiting criminals and using them to sow chaos.",
      "The exact number of attacks is difficult to quantify. The allegations range from Britain to Estonia to the Czech Republic to Poland \u2014 where, authorities say, Russia paid a group to burn down the country\u2019s biggest shopping mall in May 2024.",
      "Moscow denies all allegations of sabotage, including in the case in London. \u201cRussia has never engaged in sabotage activities against the United Kingdom and has no intention of doing so,\u201d the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom said in a statement.",
      "Calvin Bailey, a British member of Parliament who sits on the Defense Select Committee, said the London attack fit a pattern in which Russian operatives used encrypted apps and cryptocurrency to hire criminals as they tried to mask their own involvement.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re incentivized by money but the use of Telegram and bitcoin creates plausible deniability and allows the Russians to keep their distance,\u201d Bailey said in a recent interview. \u201cIt hides the trail, be that a money trail or any of the connections.\u201d",
      "According to British prosecutors the trail that led to the warehouse burning in east London began in March 2024, when a 21-year-old British drug dealer named Dylan Earl initiated communications with an anonymous account on Telegram with the usernames \u201cPrivet Bot\u201d and \u201cLucky Strike.\u201d",
      "The account was run by an operative with the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group that fought in Syria and Ukraine before it launched a short-lived mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2023 but has now been brought to heel by the Kremlin.",
      "Earl expressed interest in joining Wagner as a gun-for-hire, saying, \u201cI need a fresh start\u201d after his life of small-time crime in the U.K, according to documents released by prosecutors.",
      "But the Russian handler said Wagner had a different use for him: carrying out operations in Europe.",
      "Over the course of hundreds of messages, the Russian handler offered the young British criminal both money and ideological encouragement to burn down the warehouse, which could net him roughly $8,000.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll make you rich. And grant you things no one else can. Citizenships. Passports. Everything,\u201d the Russian handler said in a message posted on the Privet Bot account.  In another, the handler said, \u201cYou are our dagger in Europe.\u201d",
      "Earl was also encouraged to embrace a clandestine lifestyle by watching the FX show \u201cThe Americans\u201d about KGB spies operating undercover in the United States.",
      "\u201cLook how they describe Russia. But you see U.K. and USA,\u201d the handler wrote.  \u201cHomeless everywhere. Drugs etc. It is fearmongering bro. They want people scared.\u201d",
      "Earl knew he was dealing with a Wagner operative but did not back down.",
      "Within weeks of their initial messages, Earl had recruited a group of young accomplices to carry out the warehouse attack. According to prosecutors, only one of them \u2014 Jake Reeves, 23 \u2014 understood that they were starting the fire on Russian orders.",
      "Neither Earl nor Reeves was present when the fire was started by Nii Kojo Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 21, and Ugnius Asmena, 23, all of whom were convicted of aggravated arson. Instead, they watched a livestream of the blaze on FaceTime provided by Asmena.",
      "The men who actually started the fire believed it was merely a criminal act \u2014 Earl never told them they were acting on Russian orders.",
      "British detectives stepped up the hunt after they realized they were most likely dealing with a Russian state-sponsored operation targeting the Ukrainian business. They arrested Earl in early April and after they accessed his phone, quickly established his connection to the Wagner group.",
      "Earl and Reeves both pleaded guilty to aggravated arson and offenses under British national security laws.",
      "There is no suggestion that they were linked to other attacks across Europe or the groups carrying them out.",
      "\u201cThis case is a clear example of an organization linked to the Russian state using 'proxies' \u2014 in this case British men \u2014 to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf,\u201d Murphy, the Met counterterrorism head, said in a statement after the verdict.",
      "The suspected Russian-backed criminal attacks across Europe are usually unsophisticated intelligence operations. Many of the plots, like the one in London, involve arson.",
      "In June, a Colombian man was imprisoned for eight years in the Czech Republic after he was convicted of setting fire to buses in Prague. Like Earl, he was also given orders by a Russian handler over the Telegram messaging app and told to record himself setting the fire, according to Czech authorities.",
      "That type of attack is relatively low-risk for Russia, compared with sending its own professional agents into an increasingly hostile Europe.",
      "But there is some evidence that the Russian operative handling Earl had higher ambitions for his group of British gangsters-for-hire.",
      "British police said that at the time of their arrest they had already begun surveillance operations for their next plot: kidnapping a Russian dissident named Yevgeny Chichvarkin and setting fire to his Michelin-starred Hide restaurant in one of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods."
